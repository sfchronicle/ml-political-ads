welcome again to another episode of sac town talks today we have senator sidney come lager joining us on a what s happening wednesday sydney how s it going it s going well yeah thank you so much for having me um it s really windy out there so i m excited that i m inside talking to you yeah today uh another successful groundhog day the groundhog sized shadow for six more weeks of winter kind of how are you taking the news and and what are your thoughts well i don t mind layering i am a chicago girl at heart so i don t mind if it s uh windy and a little chilly and but i will say now that we re in the swing space having to you know layer up to cross the street to go over to the capitol and then come back and then go back we re gonna see how many assembly members and senators make it uh through february and march that s funny you know there s been all these talks about you know redistricting and they re calling the great resignation members are moving everywhere running differently do you attribute contribute the swing space walk to uh some of their decisions here oh my god yes i think people were like i m so upset that i don t have any more parquet in my office that i am retiring today oh yeah that s amazing jokes jokes jokes jokes but i do think it s it s um i do think for folks there s been a shift in the kind of work um in the joy that comes from it and um i do think that that s played a large role in people s decisions to retire or to not seek re election you know having a year and a half to be closer to home i do think resets people s priorities yeah you know you have an interesting background you know my producer really wants me to ask you about this uh before you got into politics can you kind of tell us kind of what what you were doing oh my goodness um i was a wild child before i got into politics i m a girl from chicago i spent my um you know i got my first taste of politics by helping my grandmother get harold washington elected as the first black mayor of chicago which is really important for folks from chicago i came out here to go um to usc i was here during the earthquake and the riots both really pivotal um moments for me and experiences as a result of the earthquake i went to graduate school back on the east coast because i do not like shaky earth but because of the riots and the um sort of relationships that i built and the interest that was peaked in my heart about the city i came back and i ve been in la ever since i ve worked in the nonprofit world i ve worked in the arts world i ve worked in the entertainment industry i eventually ended up at crystal stairs where that s where i met holly mitchell and then we kind of went on the road you know working to help families find and pay for child care and then getting her in the assembly in the senate so i have had a very interesting journey that has married activism and the arts and politics and i have to say i find great joy um in each of those things yeah i guess kind of during your your arts period you were an assistant to delroy lindo can you kind of tell us about that experience yes so you know delroy is uh you know crooklyn and gets shorty and ransom and he was in the five bloods and uh this new one with um regina king and ill just elba uh with the it was the western so um i family friend known him for a really long time i was his uh assistant and i ran his production company uh sia luna development uh we produced a number of you know one hour interviews with uh folks like joan chen the really um acclaimed director and um charles burnett and um spike lee and you know delroy is family to me i think he is beautiful and amazing and brilliant and funny um and he s in california with his family so he checks in on me from time to time but it was a great experience i mean that s where i learned kind of you know behind the scenes about the movie industry that s where i came to learn a lot about you know the trades and what goes into it and the hours that people work and uh then you get to meet you know celebrities and you realize that they are real people too with very real problems and challenges um but the highlight was actually working with him in berkeley producing this interview segment with joan chen and we ended up at the recording studio that discovered um ccr um and i mean the wall was full of all of these platinum records from this amazing you know rock band that i mean you know i think changed the landscape of music for folks so that was a thrill that s awesome kind of i guess how did your like working for you know and in the arts and the film kind of propel you into kind of working in the district for holly mitchell then so um i think the arts are really instructive for how we communicate with people um if it s theater if it s movies books tv it s really about storytelling right and how you listen how you um can transcribe a story how you can share people s perspectives that aren t like yours um and really how you become more comfortable in your own skin and i think when you re working in politics when you re doing advocacy which was what i was doing with holly at crystal stairs supervisor holly mitchell um at crystal stairs it s all about how do you make other people comfortable you know when you re sharing good news and bad news and how are you comfortable with yourself right right and so i think it really you know provided me some tools uh you know to make that work successful for me because it s hard you know at the time i was there we were having to tell people that the state didn t have any money and they were cutting budgets and we couldn t renew contracts and i mean that s hardcore for folks that are you know providing care for for kids and are really dependent on these reimbursement checks from the state at what moment did you know that you wanted to run for office at some point you know i asked that question to myself every day like is this really what you want to do you know i um my mother said when i was really little that i told her that i wanted to be in politics and so like a couple years ago she said do you remember when you said that as a little girl and i said no and you should have told me that was crazy making not to say that but i think after i helped miss mitchell get into the assembly and i served as her district director we and then in the senate we started working to nurture other women and women of color to run for office to and she was very supportive of young candidates and new candidates and you do so much work sort of training and like recruiting and supporting and you know sort of um critiquing that i thought well you know i m doing so much of this i probably could do this but it actually kind of took holly saying this is what you need to do you know you look around and it s about building a bench and so tag your red jump in um and you know and they re all kind of statistics that say you know you have to ask a woman three times to run before they decide and you know men wake up they go to the bathroom and they say they re gonna run for office um which is a joke which is a joke um so it actually took her telling me this is something you need to do like we need you in this space tag you re it for me to say maybe this is something i can do um you know and sometimes you wake up and you question is it the right decision do you have what it takes are you really making change in a way that s important um you know because i will say it s it s an awesome job but it s incredibly humbling i guess what what is so humbling about it can you kind of uh elaborate on that yeah so um the state is huge i mean they re like hundreds of agencies right they re thousands of employees and and everyone is doing something that s supposed to help the state work better and essentially that s supposed to provide services you know for the millions of folks that live in the state and it s a huge operation it s not going to work 100 correctly all the time in every nook and cranny of the state um and it s also the learning curve is quite high right because we as legislators part of our role is to create legislation that s about fixing policy that s about making the work work better right in the state with all of these nooks and crannies and departments and programs and initiatives it takes a minute to kind of figure out what those things are and what they do and how they work and what s the challenge and how and there s also so much connective tissue so that s humbling because most people run and they think they know everything and then you get here and you re like i don t think i know everything um which is like you know a heavy thing for a legislator to admit but i think that s one of the reasons why i do my watch wednesdays because i try to bring a little clarity and a little fun um to these concepts that are state government no they re interesting you know you started out in the assembly and then you kind of moved over to the senate kind of what what differences have you noticed between the assembly and the senate and kind of what what s your preference at this point so there are a lot of more there are a lot more people in the assembly and uh the color is green and so in this wing space we have different elevators we have different elevators on that you know in the capitol um i m being funny i do feel like it s more ruckus on the assembly book so i would go into a session to floor on the assembly and i swear to god i was like let me get my wheaties let me take my b12 let me put on my little helmet because something s about to jump off right um and on the senate it s much more um congenial well like ho senator oh senator and so um so that s different is this much smaller you know the the actual floor you know is like almost half the size so it does feel really tiny um but i will say i have i what s different for me is i had i came in and i had friendships that i developed on the assembly side you know before covid and when i came on to the senate it was during covet and so we were people were isolating we don t sit next to each other on the floor um and so we you don t really go out to events um so it has been much more of an isolating experience to be on the senate side because it s been harder to develop the kinds of relationships that i was able to develop on the assembly side not to say that the senators are nasty because they re not so senators if you re listening i m not saying you re nasty i m just saying covid has prevented us from like you know getting to know each other right i guess have you found that you know being on the senate is is i guess helping you get a lot more of your policies done than it would on the assembly side well you only have to count to 21 so easier that s a little easier but then you re like you know the gorilla that is the assembly is waiting for you um i feel like policy can be a little easier to get done on the senate side but i also feel like senators may i don t i shouldn t be telling any trade secrets but i do feel like senators it s harder to get you got to really talk to folks senators are like tell me about the policy what s this really about you know you re new what do you know you know so um now at the end of the day is the same man at the end of the day it s the same you gotta count your votes you gotta know what the bill is you got to work with your opposition you got to make sure your supporters are like you know got their stuff together you still got to have a well oiled machine on either side you know with redistricting happen it seems like you know musical chairs everyone s moving everywhere and you ve kind of had this a kind of an exciting announcement you re going to run for congress can you kind of tell us a little bit about uh your congressional race and kind of uh your thoughts behind running for congress so i don t know how much i can get into i don t want to get into trouble uh because i m here talking about state stuff um but great opportunities you know so many i think 22 is um going to be a turning point for the legislature because so many folks are retiring and other opportunities have opened up and so um you know people like me have looked at those kinds of opportunities i m it s bittersweet i love the work that i m doing and um love the policies that you know i plan to champion this year that we ve been successful at getting across the finish line last year um so i will say i m really excited that i don t want to get dinged for you know saying stuff i shouldn t be talking about on a state platform because you know the man does listen to the podcast i ain t trying to get in trouble with demand i think in congress you have to count like over 200 that s gonna be dude that s why i got a calculator i have a calculator here too i m like i got i do have a little vote card could you imagine like vote cards other places i ll be like five pages of a vote card overwhelming overwhelming can you kind of talk you you seem to have kind of like this this kind of serendipitous kind of like you know events of like you know moving from the assembly to the senate and now having this opportunity in in congress can you kind of kind of talk to that about kind of how you just had these cool opportunities kind of kind of do some different things here so yeah i um i know i have this like i don t know i don t want to say don t you hate when people like start talking about themselves and they like say all these amazing things and you re like dude you ain t that amazing so i don t want to say anything like that but i will say that um i consider myself you know a pretty hard worker and really strong work ethic i try not to piss people off immediately um and i really try to produce because i think at the end of the day that s what people care about like like what are you doing like what you know and um and how can we work together right and how can i be included in the thing that you re working on so that s sort of how my work ethic um translates into um you know my job performance and i just think people see that and you know unbeknownst to me i think folks have taken notice and they re like hey we we really like how she does things so we want her to carry a bill you know it s okay if i leave um you know because she can run for this um i want her to help me champion so i think it s that i also think it s luck you know right time right place um you know i knew for example that you know the senator was planning to run to be on the board of supervisors um but you know what i m gonna tell you something i knew she was gonna do that and i still was like it did not process in my mind that it was gonna happen while i was in the assembly and that i would be running for the senate so literally i was like oh yeah she s it s like she s gonna run and then she ll just be the senator and on the board and then i like very very late in the game i was like oh snap that means she s gonna go and then they re gonna have another election so you know sometimes i have like delayed reaction because i m like i can t believe we have to do this again and again yeah the grind and then like who wants to step into the shoes of holly mitchell big shoes to film big shoes to feel doing pretty well so far no and so senator ross whenever he sees me he s like how you doing i just love how we mentioned it s like how you doing i just love holly mitchell i m like hey dude what about me he s like tell holly mitchell i said that s funny you know you re kind of sharing a story about when you first got into kind of working in politics you know we had budget deficit deficits and you know cuts left and right and kind of for the last few years we ve had these big surpluses uh you know this year we have another huge budget surplus kind of what are some of your thoughts about the budget this year and some of the things you re looking you re looking to do well i am so grateful that i m working in a state that has been blessed with a surplus um amen to the gods and the goddesses um i certainly hope that the budget chair and the governor support all of my budget requests because they re all amazing and they should definitely be supported in case you re listening nancy skinner phil ting and governor newsom um but my hope is actually that this year we will really double down on investments for a statewide wellness initiative program we ve seen an uptick in suicides mental health i think is going to be the next pandemic you know you see it with not only the great resignation but the great malaise um i think there s been so much toxicity nationally um for the past four years and it s like anything when you get sick and you have an infection and you re not really working deliberately to heal you know infections can kind of fester and then grow and metastasize and i think that s what we re seeing with this you know increase in suicides increase in violence i mean there s toxicity not only in politics but sort of you know as folks are trying to re normalize what it means to socialize with intimidation and bullying and so um you know not just teachers not just students not just essential workers but you know other folks kind of across the workforce spectrums um so i really think we have to double down on that you know how we infuse behavioral health support but also mental health supports how we continue to destigmatize mental health and not just talk about it when we re talking about people who are unhoused or who use substances you know so many people are faking it until they make it and i think people are burnt out with that and that coupled with the tensions and the deaths from covid on you know have us at this very critical moment so my hope is that we really double down and deeply invest in this space you know that s that s interesting you point to that because you know a lot of talk has been about this great resignation about how people aren t coming back to work or looking to do different things and everyone s trying to get a pulse on what s what s happened and it doesn t just seem like life s gonna go back to how it was two years ago can you kind of talk about that and kind of what what you re seeing in your district and kind of your thoughts yeah so i love my district it s the 30th it will be the 28th um and so just to give people an idea of what it is we sort of are uh cocooned by uh freeways yes freeways in l a so we have the 10 freeway to the north the 110 to the east slauson um to the south no it s lawson like all the way to 120th and central so almost like to the 105 um and then the 405 to the west so we have really affluent neighborhoods and then we have folks that you know are certainly working class downtown central city chevrolet hills mid city ladera heights um mar vista palms so we ve seen everything you know you i represent folks that have been able to you know work from home and that have supports and have people coming in helping them with their kids have access to the vaccinations and the boosters and the tests you know very early on and then we have folks that are essential workers and are working a couple of jobs that have side hustles that are you know that are really important to how they you know make the rent um and people are really interested i think in being entrepreneurs um and finding their own way because quality of life has become incredibly important and like working someplace where you have to commute long distances where you might not have the kind of benefits that you need where you might not have the kind of time off that you need or the flexibility where you have a lot of folks living in your house and young kids helping other you know littler kids like manage um you know i see all of that in the homes of the constituents that i represent so covet has been great because it s encouraged people to come up with new you know business models for the jobs that they re trying to you know create um and it s been really tough um because many of the folks you know many of my communities you know were last to get the ppe they were last to get access to the tests they were last to get access to the vaccines so lots of um disparities across the spectrums but i love my district you know this is the second year of a two year session kind of what so what are some of the bills you i guess are kind of finishing up from last year and some new ones you re proposing this year well you know i was thinking about reintroducing ab369 which was my street medicine bill um that was about making sure that you could have mobile units mobile healthcare units to help folks get access to care uh who are unhoused but lo and behold it found its way into the state budget so somebody was listening um but i ve got a spicy package it s a little bit of uh criminal legal reform but you know having access to medical records um and being able to access you know get your identification that you need when you get out definitely going back to the health care space trying to rerun the bill about drug importation from canada um you know even florida with crazy desantis you know is trying to do this and you know we know that the costs are really um exorbitant and so how do we get cheaper prices right um working on that uh aca 3 which is about taking slavery and involuntary servitude out of the california constitution who would have thought um it s still in there shout out for um black history month uh we got like a lot of bills that actually this year that i m running are focusing on economic justice and equity so how do we bring parity right how do we take away some barriers that are preventing people from having access to capital and opportunities to um you know find and keep jobs and develop family wealth not family wealth like billions you know but like so i can make my mortgage and pay for my kid to have lunch at school and you know be able to wash my clothes and save some pennies and not be living paycheck to paycheck so i m really focused on on bills that will allow that to happen you know it s so cool what you do with these you know what what s happening wednesdays yes videos and explaining things kind of what s what s one piece of california politics or the legislature that you haven t explained yet that you would like people to understand so i have not explained what goes on in rules committee so i sit on rules and we do confirmations you know for the governor um that s kind of heady because you get all these binders about information about all these people in all these departments that s what i m like lord have mercy this is what you do so we haven t explained that we do have one coming out today um i am in contract negotiations with my puppets because there was such demand for them now they have presented me with these rider contracts you know they want the green m m s and they don t want to work on thursdays and so we re they re part of a puppet union and you know i am definitely pro labor uh so i m working with the puppets to come up with some you know other topics that they are willing to um discuss um but you know what happens in rules is a biggie right for the senate and the assembly and kind of how the floor runs people don t really know about that yeah you re right rules is such a mystery kind of what happens in rules stays in rules i know well that s right what happens in rule stays and rules we should do karaoke one day in rules i think so i said pro time let s do some karaoke while we re like trying to confirm this person for get the ratings out yes it s like cable access ain t nobody watching our hearings well awesome sydney thank you so much for taking the time and hanging out with us here uh just love the jacket and the outfit and looking forward to getting those puppets back to work thank

another episode of sac town talks today we have an interesting episode for you all we have matthew silver and jamie zoller joining us from the california association of code officers guys thanks for joining the program how s it going going well thank you so much for having us yeah so interesting so you guys are part of the california association of code officers can you kind of tell us a little bit about the association and kind of what are code officers well kco the california association of code enforcement officers is a statewide association that handles training legislation networking all incumbent with for code enforcement officers for the response for what a code enforcement officer is a code officer is an officer in a city or county who oversees and enforces local building codes zoning laws and ordinances we also handle health and safety issues such as substandard housing hoarding marijuana dispensaries and most recently our roles kind of switched to handle covenant enforcement as well and our goal is to ensure the quality of life for residents in our areas i might add if i could that you know i think the best way to think of a code enforcement officer number one is that we re not peace officers we are health and safety uh officers we re not sworn officers by and large secondly i call us the swiss army tool of every city we kind of do all the weird stuff or the stuff that the other departments building safety planning police don t deal with a lot of quality of life issues so i would say to your listeners when they re thinking about you know a problem in their neighborhood that bugs them every day or every night when they re thinking about a maybe the poor quality of housing they re living in those kind of things we re the ones who respond to those issues and deal with those issues it s a really wide array of things that we deal with to keep communities safe and kind of just running so that s interesting so you guys basically have a i guess like a code enforcement uh local government perspective but you guys aren t peace officers right you guys aren t you know you guys don t carry guns uh right and no formal training or academy is that correct we we do have formal training uh and that s a kind of a recent thing actually for a long time code enforcement didn t have kind of centralized standards or training a couple years ago kco uh put forward a bill that got signed into law that created for the first time uh set professional standards for what it means to be a certified code officer in the state and kco is the certifying body for that so we re kind of getting our act together so to speak and professionalizing and making more uniform our organization but you re right we don t carry guns we re not police officers we re not we don t want to be peace officers we appreciate what they do we support what they do but we are not they we re the ones out in the community dealing with kind of community quality of life issues although i ll tell you and this may be a subject for a later question um we are increasingly being tasked with dealing with issues that have been kind of what you think of as traditional policing drug dens drug houses uh illegal cannabis grows um prostitution issues human trafficking issues so this kind of change that s interesting so like you know i think first thing everyone hears is code enforcement officer they automatically think like parking tickets is that totally different subset am i off there there s some jurisdictions that would handle parking issues parking citations but no that s not at all what we focus on like matt said uh we focus on that quality of life for the residents in the community and helping to make sure that things are safe for them basically so like in sacramento we have like an app called like three one one if you have a problem you type it in the app and then somebody takes care of it whether it s you know it s a random car in front of your house uh you know or your neighbor s doing something uh is that kind of kind of what we re talking about here where where you guys kind of helping force you know county or city ordinances that s correct that s exactly what we do um there s different apps that each jurisdiction does have for their city for their citizens to be able to report different things whether it s the smell of or the odor of marijuana coming from their neighbor s house or short term vacation rental issues or hoarding issues or trash junk debris anything like that that s the type of things that we won t handle oh interesting and kind of i guess as you brought up you know for the past year covet 19 has been present and i guess you guys have taken a new role kind of enforcing a lot of these county health orders can you kind of talk to us about that and how that s kind of gone this past year absolutely uh we have been handling anything from mass enforcement to making sure that people are wearing masks out in the public or in businesses um at various stages the yellow stage orange stage whatever stage that county or region is in to making sure that those businesses are closed or they re not operating during certain levels thank goodness right now we re not having to deal with that and most of our businesses are open and things are changing greatly and the mask requirements are changing so our role is continuing to change even with that yeah as i imagine you know a lot of these covet 19 issues were uh people were very passionate about it you know you see a lot of grocery stores and increasing their uh you know armed presence uh you know because people were uh upset about mass spandex things like that kind of what what kind of risks has have health officers seen out there code enforcement officers seen uh kind of enforcing a lot of these things this this past year just what you explained i rate people angry frustrated people we re all um in similar situations where we re having to deal with job losses and um you know people dying in our families and all sorts of very stressful situations so people s stress levels and lack of patience is running high so when that happens then obviously the code enforcement officers law enforcement and other people are their safeties out so yeah it s a great point about covet i mean it s definitely the dangers are escalated for code enforcement officers kind of thrust out in the field enforcing these coveted rules however this is nothing new we deal with uh some really touchy issues we go on private property which raises some real sensitivities and you know that can include going into a slumlords property where they ve got a bunch of tenants they re taking rent from them they don t appreciate us being there getting in the way of their revenue this might be dealing with things like you know cannabis where we ve got this kind of state experiment i would call it to legalize a portion of cannabis but in order for that those cultivators to survive legally the illegal ones have to be shut down and these can be some touchy issues as well so it s not new but it is escalating yeah i guess it s an interesting point so as as non sworn um you know enforcers of of the law how do you guys handle these situations and and i guess at what point do you call law enforcement in to help assist you with uh what you re doing i guess kind of what s your hammer to enforce a lot of this stuff that s a great question how do we handle it uh i think it just is on a case by case basis uh it depends if we have knowledge that um there s an issue at the property or there s some type of volatile situation we absolutely will take law enforcement with us because they have the tools to be able to protect us because we do not if we don t know what we re walking into that s where the danger really comes in too we have many situations and scenarios personally and from our our partners that have gone through different things and different scenarios where it was just an average call and it was just i was going to knock on someone s door something as simple as that so you just really don t know no definitely not good i imagine there s a lot of uh uncertain things i remember you know back in 2010 i worked as a as a census worker and just going door to door and just kind of never know what s behind those doors and it s not definitely not a fun experience i could only imagine when you went uh and kind of tried to enforce some things but i guess you know is it is it mostly you know writing letters and civil fines is that s kind of what what these people are looking at okay we ve got we ve got kind of a whole toolbox of tools that we use it it escalates in code enforcement almost across the board number one we re reactive in nature so we get involved what a neighbor sometimes a tenant in like a substandard building calls us we re not out there looking for violations by and large we don t have the personnel or the time for that so we ll do an inspection a kind of an in person conversation with the individual uh then there s a letter to notice a violation saying here s the violations you ve got by this time to fix it and here s how to fix it right so they ve got a chance there to do it voluntarily it doesn t work then they ll usually issue some kind of local fine we call it an administrative fund it s like a parking ticket pretty much yeah uh to kind of encourage compliance if that doesn t work then we go to court and court oftentimes is civil enforcement and that can take different aspects right so it is interesting i guess you know as part of the association i guess you know i guess who is part of the association kind of what what are the things you guys are are working on this year the association is made up of um code enforcement officers from around the state of california they consist of managers line level officers supervisors we have technicians code techs so it s all encompassing so that is who casey was really made up and is it is it a city and county thing or is you know do some counties have their own thing encompassing cities as well or well casey is a statewide kc is a statewide association so it encompasses all um city and county so anyone can participate in that training and like matt was saying before more often not than these officers are becoming certified through our association as well to obtain that training for anything from officer safety to zoning and landing land use regulations anything to that feature so uh as jamie as jamie could uh attest to code enforcement our association is made up of a lot of different folks code enforcement officers code enforcement managers uh county people city people anybody who s involved in code enforcement uh is a part of our group in the state or statewide organization uh we re really busy we re involved in a lot we re really trying to push the profession and uh help ensure that we can continue meeting the statewide goals and uh policies that our legislators are setting for us so this year our focus has been on code enforcement officer safety we can t meet those goals we can t protect our communities if we re not safe in doing our jobs and unfortunately the safety standards just have not caught up to the work that we re doing and so one bill we have right now is senate bill 296 this bill would require every city and county to establish safety standards for code enforcement officers specific to the threats they face in their jurisdiction so we recognize that code officers in different places around the state face different issues so it s not a one size fits all approach it just simply says cities and counties you have to have some kind of standards it s got to be specific to the threats we face okay and i guess sb296 who who s carrying that bill and kind of who s supporting it senator limon uh out of the ventura county area is supporting it we are so thankful to her and her team for carrying this bill and helping us push this important cause the congress on racial equality i think is a supporter worth mentioning they recognize that code enforcement officers are really i would say the main people on the front lines trying to improve communities that are struggling communities that often core and their partners serve that are really trying to improve and and make it a better safer place so we we really appreciate their support we have support from other housing groups there really is no opposition to this bill oh interesting yeah kind of without everything brought out in the last year with kind of inequities and so forth you guys are are right at the center of you know enforcing a lot of these things that uh you know try to keep an even playing field out there so thank you for that um i guess you know before we go you know all of us haven t been in social settings i imagine when you guys go to a cocktail party people ask you what you do and you say you re a code enforcement officer and they re like what is that do you guys each have you know a story that explains not only what you do but something funny that s happened in in your world of code enforcement goodness that s a good question and yeah absolutely um i think some of the funnier ones that we ve had to deal with or that i ve had to deal with personally um is trying to identify a chicken to see what if it s a chicken or a rooster i mean whole education on chickens that s gone on um they have service chickens now too so you know there s they re important not just for eggs that s funny what about yourself matt yeah um so you know it s funny i was i was offered a job as a code officer when i was in college i had no idea what the heck a code officer was and you know i m actually a practicing lawyer and a certified code officer i represent code folks throughout the state and uh it s it s funny i still struggle to explain it to folks what do we do so i i like to just say we keep communities clean if you if you have an issue you complain about we re the ones dealing with that issue right right um funny story you know i gosh something i love about it is uh you never see you never cease to be amazed it s always something new i remember having a lot of bizarre cases but one of them was a uh illegal fighting ring with also coupled up with an unlicensed dentistry office so i guess it was like a bet on rooster number five and then go get your molar fixed or something interesting combination there that s too much that s funny both involving chicken so uh right good good poultry out there going good to know you know everyone s doing those backyard chicken things these days you know i can just i can see that being a problem you know yeah yeah and that s you know that s kind of the lighter side of it obviously we deal with some really heavy issues with housing that s a really big thing i read some stat the other day that there s like you know tens of millions of people in our country who are living in substandard housing you know we may be a really rich economy but we have a tremendous substandard housing crisis in california ghost ship fire in oakland 36 people died or so something around there that was that s exactly something we we deal with and try to do better to prevent and encompassing too with that is you know like matt was saying it s not all funny or um you know with the substandard housing but it s it can be very dangerous um you know spinoff too from kco our association has been the code enforcement officer safety foundation which is actually focused on officer safety um specifically and because of certain situations um like uh jill robinson from the city of utah i m sorry the state of utah uh in 2018 she had an open property nuisance case at a location she went to the property to meet the homeowner to talk about all the violations and he showed up with a gun and shot her through her city truck door and then lit her on fire and let the neighbor s house on fire so i mean just very tragic things like that and she was just going there for a regular um you know talking to the person and just that first meet up yeah yeah we ve had about 20 code officers actually murdered in the line of duty and i think you know most people don t know what a code officer is and they certainly aren t going to know the risks that we face so whereas you know we face all sorts of threats intimidation all sorts of things you can imagine people aren t always appreciative uh of course the people who call and complain the tenants whose lives we save they re appreciative but um you know these other folks aren t so appreciative so all the more reason we re so thankful uh for you helping us spread this awareness and having us on your show talk about what it is we do and good hearted people trying to do good things yeah and i guess you know before we go can you i guess give us some information about how we can find a little bit more about the association online and i guess find you on social media and stuff like that absolutely thank you for asking that kco has a website it s kcocaceo us you can find us there you can also find us on linkedin and facebook our website has all of our information about how to contact us how to volunteer how to become involved in our profession and our social media platforms assist us with advertising our training and certification processes for people that are in the code enforcement profession yeah and i guess one one last question for you before you guys go if if some of our listeners have some some issues they think they re a code enforcement issue what what s the best way to i guess notify you guys to come take a look at and um kind of address it each jurisdiction has a website for instance i m in the san diego county area so it just depends on what city or county that you live in they will have a website and a code compliance code enforcement or community enhancement and safety link on their websites that you can click on and file complaints online and and i guess are these complaints usually uh what do they call that um you know anonymous anonymous right because i think that s always an apprehension people have oh if i knock this person out they ll know it s me and then i m going to get it of course no they mostly i know that every jurisdiction in san diego county is all anonymous because of that reason they don t want to have the person complaining fearing retribution or any type of retaliation so we really do protect um the people who are complaining they re anonymous by law uh in the state and so uh for that very reason right a neighbor a lot it s almost always a neighbor complaining about a neighbor or a tenant complaining about their their landlord and so uh for that reason it s anonymous by law okay awesome well thank you so much guys for taking some time and explaining to us about coding officers it was definitely educational and uh it was great interesting episode so thank you so much for joining us guys thank you for having us thank you for having us,"police,college,enforcement

still in the midst of this pandemic and um one of the things that s important to me not only as a physician but you know as a mom with kids in school is that we are able to keep all californians hate healthy and safe that we re able to keep our schools open and our businesses um thriving and so there are a group of us um that people affectionately call the vax caucus or the vaccine caucus oh really yeah and um and so with us we have introduced eight bills so far dealing with vaccines um or around covet in general and so my the bill that i am pushing out from that caucus is ab1797 which deals with updating the california immunization registry and what this would do is one gives schools the ability to have you know access to the immunization registry the california immunization registry they do have limited access at this point but only can really only report on those vaccines that are required um and so you know it s hard right now for them to to say who s been vaccinated with covered vaccine or not because that s not a required vaccine at this point um and it also requires physicians that give out vaccines to make sure that they re putting this information into the vaccine registry and then the other thing the bill does which is very important is that as you re putting the information into the vaccine registry you also input the race and ethnicity unless the particular patient or parent opts out and the reason why this is so important is because we know about health disparities we know about um issues as far as who s getting immunizations and who s who is not and so this is actual data to prove that uh there are some disparities there or there aren t and if there are disparities then we can focus our efforts and resources on those communities to help make sure that we re getting um the information to them and that we re also providing access for for those communities to become vaccinated so that s a big part a big priority for me you know you were talking about how you were in this what is it what do you guys call the vaccine caucus is that what you guys call yourself that s what we re yeah that s what we re kind of known as it s um and we got together we started this um actually during the summer recess last year because we kind of saw that there may be an uptick in covet around uh winter time but it s um myself assembly member lowe assembly member wix um senator pan senator newman and senator weiner and we ve been working on these bills and kind of you know i guess is it surprising to you seeing this kind of vaccine hesitancy and you know a lot of discussion about kids and vaccines and uh you know it kind of bewildering to me and a lot of people but you know it seems to be a major issue and kind of what do you guys expect and you know how how do you deal with this yeah well you know it s definitely unfortunate it s um you know i think that over time um there s just been a growing number of people who are just against vaccines in general but with this particular um virus and this particular vaccine it was so politicized and i in my lifetime do not remember anything like this being politicized you know whether it was the flu or ebola somewhere else like i don t remember you know it s science is science and um and so i think because it was so politicized that s why we re saying what we re seeing today i mean and i was talking to a friend earlier because i was looking at like vaccination race from different states and um you know you can you can see the difference unfortunately in what are considered quote blue states and what are considered quote red states in terms of um the percent of facts of their population that it s vaccinated so it s that s why we re seeing it this time i mean i think that it s natural to be um concerned about something new um i i admit you know when i got the vaccine i was like oh my goodness because i was practicing at the time i was doing surgeries and so the first week that it came out i had to get it and i was like oh my god oh my god but now we ve had so many people that have gotten the vaccine that um you know there have been more people that have gotten it than we ve had in any previous study or trial or anything before anything came came out that you know a lot of the the concern or the rhetoric is is completely unfounded um there was a mother at my son s school who said oh i m not gonna have my daughter get the vaccine because i want her to have children in the future i was like what wait huh you know so because now there s this thought that it s going to cause infertility so um it s it s it s unfortunate um it s unfortunate because it is a virus that is still very contagious and for those who are not vaccinated it is potentially so very deadly and um you know it s also a virus that you don t know once you get it what that long haul syndrome is going to be for you and um you know i have uh my dad is from louisiana i went to school and i went to college in louisiana and i have family in louisiana that think a little different than i do and i spoke with one of my cousins a few weeks ago and found out that he had just gotten out of the hospital because he s not vaccinated and he had been in with covid for um 22 days in the icu 18 of those days i see 18 of those days because he believed that the vaccine had killed someone so it s um it is it is unfortunate that it s been so politicized because it allows for all this misinformation and disinformation to get out there and just run rampant in our communities right make sure you

hate america there s no longer a question about that and yet paradoxically at the same time they desperately want to control america more than anything loving the people you lead is the most basic prerequisite of leadership we cannot let them run this nation because they hate it music music this is so funny thank you well i love you too thank you thank you guys thank you this is it s so funny i never go anywhere i literally never leave my house and i i haven t i haven t been in a room with other people oh you are too though we haven t met uh i appreciate that i m not often called sexy where i live um but thank you thank you for having me this is such a trip and and i m really grateful i m grateful to be here i never leave i never give a speech i never do anything so um when charlie asked me yeah it sounds like a pretty fun job um so i was thinking i i live on the west coast of florida and i was thinking as i was driving yeah go west coast of florida baby it really is kind of the freedom state um but i was thinking about as i do every day like what exactly is going on here in america and i m not um you know we do a show every night so i m paid to think about it but there s so much happening that it s hard sometimes to get the overview when you re caught up in all the details and people are you know texting you this outrage or this abomination and you sort of don t have a chance to pause and kind of add them all up i grew up in a world where thing i m 51 so america in my youth was really simple ideologically there was the soviet union which was left and then there were the normal people who were right and one side was for centralized control and communism and the other side was for market capitalism and freedom and christianity and you know all the good things it was left versus right and so it s with that framework that i kind of assess what s going on in the world and i began to change my mind memorial day weekend when everything started to fall apart and this group of people oh yeah this group of people kind of like all of a sudden flooded in the streets and started breaking things and so i called a bunch of friends of mine who were there covering this and i said you know who are these people i mean there was this well publicized death of somebody in minneapolis and that was the pretext but obviously there was something bigger going on here and i called a bunch of friends who were covering this and i said okay what exactly is going on why are they breaking things and setting things on fire and hurting people and he s like well these are avowed marxists and they re taking on capitalism and then allied with them is another group that hates law enforcement and they re trying to end the rule of law and i m like okay that makes sense like you know radical leftists nihilists whatever but they have an agenda they re against capitalism and they re against law enforcement okay i mean i m not you know for that but it kind of made sense so i watched this thing unfold over the over the subsequent weeks and i noticed something really weird the people who were against capitalism were destroying the smallest businesses in the country they were going after like pizza places and liquor stores and camera shops assuming any of those still exist and dry cleaners and car dealerships and i was like okay you know i guess that s capitalism but in 2020 we have bigger examples like apple and google right the richest people in the world are capitalists purportedly they re the tech monopolies and not only are they not getting their windows broken they re funding it it s like wait a second how are the anti capitalist people ignoring the actual capitalists and then i look over at the other group and they re like we re against law enforcement i m like all right well you can make the case that like not all law enforcement is great there s the biggest law enforcement agency in america it s called the fbi and i think you could make a solid case that you know they do good but they ve also you know done some things for which they should be deeply ashamed because they were abuses of power including things that i saw personally so if you re against law enforcement i suppose you re going to be calling the fbi to account for its abuses of power but no instead they went after the beat cop the guy who s paid 55 grand a year to trudge through the most dangerous neighborhoods in the country arrest criminals help old ladies get cats out of trees or whatever like do the retail end of law enforcement this is a guy who may not have a college degree who s not making any money who has precisely zero power in american society and this guy is the villain just like the random cop trust me if you intersect with american law enforcement you hope it s a random cop and not the fbi i mean he may take your beer but he s not going to tap your phone or put you in prison for the rest of your life for a thought crime but for some reason the people who were against law enforcement completely ignored this and i began to realize maybe what they re saying isn t what they actually mean maybe they re not telling the whole truth about their motives maybe the people who say they re against capitalism aren t maybe the people who say they re against law enforcement aren t maybe this is part of a larger trend where the big things are getting bigger the powerful are getting more powerful and everybody else is getting the shaft maybe what we re watching is a consolidation of power and maybe the people who have it are using these forces as their kind of shock troops in order to get what they want so if you re a huge corporation you want less competition monopoly is what you want to be and maybe they re paying for these vandals because they know in the end it ll make them more powerful this occurred to me in like june because i m slow and then i see the numbers i see that the money numbers which are always like some of the most revealing numbers but they re the ones we never talk about because somehow that s like irrelevant because every when everything is political and everything is ideological you kind of miss the obvious points which is if if you want to know who s in favor of the way things are look at who s getting richer and you see the numbers and you see that jeff bezos who has been paying for this has benefited wildly from it you think wait a second maybe there s something else going on so that s a long preamble to the following point i used to see the world in terms purely left and right and i was and will remain on the right but i m starting to think that s not exactly the way i need to understand what s happening in the world maybe it s a matter of the big versus the small the powerful versus the powerless the corporate versus the independent and that s another way to put it the good versus the bad people want to think for themselves versus the people who want to demand you think the way they tell you to think maybe that s what it s actually about so then i reassessed a lot of the things that i think are the worst about american society and i began to realize those things aren t necessarily left wing values they re corporate values so if you re running a company what do you want obedient workers you want people whose first loyalty is to you who show up on monday morning who work through the weekend who give you their all who give you their lives and in return you give them a paycheck but you give them no loyalty and no promise of long term commitment it s a it s a continuous one night stand you re just hooking up you re being used that s true contrast that with the relationship you have with the people you love your best friends your family the people with whom you have like sincere intimate personal relationships they re there for you no matter what and when you get the diagnosis or you get laid off from your job or when things turn bad when you have to wear a mask as you ride your bike or the world falls apart those are the people who are there for you those are the people you re freaking me out dude this man s whispering sweet nothings to me from the front row those are the people who care about you who actually care about you they re not the ones who are telling you oh we really care about you because of the way you look and we re on your side these are the people who are actually on your side who are going to loan your money or let you sleep on the couch or talk you through a tragedy in your own life those are the relationships that matter they re the only relationships that matter and they re almost never the relationship you have with your employer if you work for a huge company i m sorry it s just true so what you re seeing what you re seeing and you see it up and down american society is the triumph of the values of those people over the values that we hold and that made this country great and if you re wondering why american families are falling apart and if you re wondering why every directive you hear from washington divides you from your family that s why because they want your first loyalty to be to them so the question in a circumstance like this is what do you do about it how do you respond to it and the first the first thing you need to know is what s actually happening this is not you know your enemy as horrible as they are is not some crazed ideologue wearing black spray painting statues that person is loathsome and should be in jail trust me and i call for that nightly but your actual enemy is the person who s funding him and making that kind of behavior possible and is doing it for a very specific reason to tear down the past to destroy the past now why do they want to destroy the past because when you destroy the past you eliminate all reference points if you have no idea what came before you you have no idea what normal is and you cannot understand the consequences of what s happening now if you can t look to the past and understand the consequences of the same behavior in another time right the root of wisdom is knowing what happened before i mean that s the road map so when you destroy that you have an entire country that is very easily manipulated okay so the first thing to know is that s what s going on the second thing to know is that small is almost always better than big that s the truth the circle of people in your life who care enough about you to help you when things go wrong is really small there are a lot of people you re friends with on instagram or facebook or whatever in the fake digital world that we ve been lulled into participating in but the actual number of people who will take affirmative steps to help you is very very small it s not 350 million that s how many people are in this country it s not 7 billion it s like eight so your loyalty always has to be to them to your family and your closest friends above anything else period and anyone who tells you otherwise anyone who tells you that your real loyalty has got to be to some larger group of people some political group or some group of people who look like you give them the middle finger those are your enemies i m serious i m serious they are trying to destroy the fortifications that will protect you through life which are the people you love and who love you back okay so that s the first thing to know small is always bigger better be distrustful of concentrations of power they can be easily misused this is like a basic life point that we seem to have forgotten they can be easily misused and often are so if something is enormous it s a threat to you period whether it s a giant boulder you re standing under for your christmas card picture that could topple over and flatten you or whether it s google the largest and most powerful company in human history is a threat to you because it s so powerful it s a greater threat to the us government it has more power and it uses it in ways that are hidden and it is totally unaccountable to you as frustrating as the federal government can be and i spend my life raging against it at least on a theoretical level you could vote them out power from a company like google is completely resistant to your views they don t care what you think and they have no reason to care what you think okay so here s the way i think about it all the stuff is going on there s very little of it that we can actually control let s just be totally honest about that and by the way you should always keep that in mind through life you have less control than you think you do you didn t control your birth you can t add an hour to your life you just can t no one can no one s ever been able to know and ever will be able to so if you want to be wise and make clear headed decisions just remember there are a lot of things you can t control focus on the things that you can control it s like the famous neighbor quote and the thing that you can control is whether your personal life is happy productive and has inherent meaning period and no one wants to say that because it never increases their power to encourage you to have a normal happy personal life it never increases their power at all in fact it detracts from their power because you re going to wind up finding someone getting married having kids and be more loyal to them than to your political or corporate leaders and that s why they work against it in fact that is the main threat to their power and if you re wondering why big companies across the country are now offering to freeze the eggs of their female employees it s not because they re compassionate it s because they re demanding that you give them the best years of your life to serve them that you put off the thing that gives our lives meaning above all else which is passing on your genes having children that s the core meaning in life that you put that off so you can sell more widgets for them and juice the stock price and in return you get what nothing they don t know your last name but they ll freeze your eggs because we re a compassionate enlightened company yeah no because they want total control and it shows you why are the big companies so in favor of social policy that degrades the family pretending that men and women are exactly the same which they are not they are not they are very different and they need each other they need each other in order to be whole that s the truth they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle physically and spiritually for a reason which is they complement each other they need each other we need each other and anyone who tells you we don t is your enemy so the point in case this isn t clear is that what actually matters i mean i could trust me i could bore you for four hours on the intricacy of this or that policy but i was just brooding on this in the car drinking my perry i m tucker carlson for perrier it s a pause that refreshes like what actually matters what can you actually control very little and so you should focus on the things you can and you should recognize what s going on here and who s your friend and who s your enemy anyone who encourages you to think for yourself to be more imp independent minded and economically independent not just have an independent conscience and think whatever you want but be able to support yourself and your family anyone who encourages that is your friend anyone who tells you you can t live without me you need me you need to be loyal to me give me your everything that person is a false god and do not worship that person i don t care who it is it s true applause because there s a reason there s a reason for that so how do wise people live like if you re i i don t have i m not young so i can t actually see very many of you but i suspect there are a lot of people like under 30 here right charlie made that claim so if you re young and you re out of step politically and clearly you are or you wouldn t be here listening to america s most despised talk show host ramble on yeah well if you re young sorry i m sorry for the self reference i tried to avoid so like if you re young and the world is changing really fast in fact so fast that almost nobody can get a handle on where it s going or what it means it s very hard to add it all up it s very easy to isolate here are 19 shocking things that happened yesterday it s very hard to see the pattern in them and most of the people who see the patterns of them are also by the way crazy because sometimes crazy people can see the big picture but i m being dead serious by the way i always have a couple crazy people on staff because they can see things i m not joking but if you re young and like this is all happening you know i ve got kids i ve got one child in college and they re going you know and i so i sort of know what it you know means to be 21 or 18 or 25 or whatever it s like very bewildering so what should you do how should you live and so because i can t control myself because i never can here s my prescription okay the very first thing i would do and i try to do every single day is remember that it ends like the big lie in american life there are many lies but the biggest lie the one that has the deepest roots and the and the worst effects is that no one ever dies that no one ever dies it s like the one topic you can you could get up here and like tell you about my sex life not that you d be interested but i could get up here and say anything and like no one would be shocked but the one thing that is completely shocking to people is that people die like that s the verboten topic like no talking about that it s awful and even now i can see people sour faces like the death talk but it is also at the same time the one thing that s true of every living person and has always been and always will be there s an end to it it s the basic fact of life it s not just a fact it is the basic fact this play has a finale and it does tell you something about the people in charge that it s the one topic they never want to discuss are you kidding we ve got medicine for that why don t you exercise more are you joking but none of that in the end will change that unchanging fact that s called nature the people running our culture our government and our economy are fundamentally at war with nature i mean that in the broadest sense they may claim to be environmentalists none of them ever gone outside by the way none of them they can be environmentalists if they want but they are fundamentally at war with nature the basic fact of nature is that life begins it has an arc and then it ends so what does that mean for you does it mean be depressed it means face it head on and think through the implications there are many here s the most basic you don t have the time you think you do don t waste time that s the bottom line don t waste time and i mean literally not a second i ve wasted looking back on my life which i try not to do but i ve wasted like a ton of money in my life a ton i ve been out of money because i m not good money and i m not good at math okay and i ve never really regretted that i mean at certain times i ve been concerned about it but i ve never been like oh i wish i hadn t ordered you know like an extra french toast from room service because the truth is i liked you know i enjoyed it i do not regret any of that the only thing i regret in retrospect is wasting time that is a bitter pill that is tough to acknowledge i wasted time because you can t get that back that s a cliche that old people drop on you and you re like all right grandpa right life goes fast i bet when you re 80 but the truth is they re right that s the one thing that old people say that you should definitely believe if you re lucky you will be older before you think and if you re unlucky hit by a bus walking out of the convention center it s just true sorry so back up from that do not waste time so what does that mean it doesn t just mean work harder at your job it means don t delay adulthood don t delay full life the most upsetting trend from my perspective in a company full a country full of upsetting trends is this idea that i m going to get married and have kids after i m a success at work because like the people at work are gonna like help you succeed so you can get married and have kids and leave the company yeah i don t think so no they re gonna get what they can from you and maybe they re nice people maybe they re not but their interests are not the same as your interests your interest is to participate fully in human life in your life to be fully human to experience it to the maximum extent you possibly can for the time that you have that s the truth so my advice is exactly the opposite and i mean this with heartfelt sincerity you should get married as soon as you can and you should do it you should do it while you re too young and then after you get married too young you should have more kids than you can afford okay and then after you do that you should try to get a job for which you are not qualified okay you should jump face first into the pool of life i mean it i mean it put a blindfold up in fact get up on the roof i m serious get to the back of your double wide you gotta you got an above ground pool right there and just run right off the end like that that s you hitting life face first will it hurt yeah yeah but you gotta enter the pool you do and every day that you delay that you will regret trust me trust me seek meaning seek intensity meaning comes from other people i spent my whole life debating ideology and politics and i m deeply interested in it and i m deeply ideological i don t say that as a as a point of pride i say that as a confession i don t i think you can be too ideological but i think in the end and i mean literally at the end you will not look back and say you know i just wish they d lowered the marginal tax rate by six percent my life would have been a victory you re just not going to say that i don t think anyone in human history i don t think hayek said that on his deathbed maybe he did i wasn t there but the point is everything that you do now should be serving in a positive way your long term interest which may not be that long term like do it now and anything that anesthetizes you or keeps you from fully experiencing the only life that you have stop it so i mean i may totally mean that i m like the only adult who s against wheat everyone loves the weed and everyone i know smokes the weed i m sure you guys all smoke the weed i m sure you get your dab pens right now in your pockets but the reason yeah you ve got a dab pen baby no dab pen okay got it got it every time i say this at like a dinner party everyone looks at me like oh i thought you were cool oh god the anti drug guy again okay i m actually not i don t have an ideological problem with it i have a practical problem with it and anything that causes you to experience life less deeply anything that causes you to miss the amazing show going on right now in front of you is stealing from you it s stealing your life and it s not just weed that s just the beginning and i don t want to get like creepy about it or too specific but there are a lot of things that people are into now a lot of them digitally that are detractors from the intensity of life right they make it easier to pretend that everything s fine and they also make it harder to acknowledge how amazingly wonderful everything is they dull you you don t want to be dull you want at the end to say holy smokes that was ridiculous like some of it was amazing some of it was like shockingly bad like i can t believe that happened but i was there for all of it you don t want to wake up in the third act and be like what the hell just happened you know what i mean you don t want to be the guy snoring in the third row which i have done so live it experience it to the maximum possible extent that you can but always remember the measure always is how are the people around you those eight people you love most and who love you back critically and don t lie to yourself a lot of the people who are on tv and trust me i know them all who claim they really love you they don t know your last name they don t know your first name they don t love you they may agree with you they may want your help your support your ratings this is true for politicians they want your votes apple wants your money but they definitely don t love you trust me i know them so take stock of the people who do love you and focus all your attention on them because that s all we can control i look out every night every night at like five i get a cup of coffee i pad to the kitchen i get a cup of coffee then i go back to my bedroom i have a desk the dogs are there my wife s coming in and out and i start writing the script every night five nights a week and usually around 5 30 when i m like through the second paragraph i m like man things are bad i always have the same thought every night i m like boy the people who seek the destruction of the things i love my family my country my conscience the ones who are trying to get me to repeat things that i don t believe the ones who are forcing me or trying to to lie in public the ones who are getting me to dance like a monkey i m serious some of the things they ask you to do are so preposterous the only explanation is they want to see if they can make you do it no it s totally true that s what they re saying it s all about their power like i wonder if we can get the public to do this yeah can we get them you know not just wear masks and elevators fine can we get a guy who s on a kayak alone in the middle of the pacific ocean to wear a mask as if he s going to get infected by the seals can we get him do you think we can no we can t make him do that come on are you joking oh yeah we can here s what we ll do we ll arrest him when he gets back on the beach and we ll invite a news crew to film it so everyone else will know you better do exactly what they tell you to do or you re going to jail that s not and by the way i m not minimizing govid i m highlighting what s actually going on which is a legitimate tragedy leveraged for the personal power of a small group of people i mean obviously so i just every night i m sitting at my desk writing this stuff and i m like man i don t know like how many free minded people are there left actually i mean i i do think this like it s kind of dark but i m alone the dogs never say anything and i m like really can you win i mean it s not like it s not like two sides sort of facing off against each other it s like actually no no joke no exaggeration it s the most powerful people in the world all aligned i sound like a lunatic when i say this but it s measurably true the last election was a perfect example i mean the numbers tell the story you don t need to be some late night radio nut case you just read the numbers where d the money come from how much did one side have how much did the other side have who gave it it s the most powerful people in the world all on one side and i think that s terrible for the country i really believe in actual diversity where there s like a robust debate where two sides you each have a position we kind of talk it out and like you know one wins but it s a pretty fair fight that s not where we are now so i look at this and i m like oh man is it hopeless like can you actually beat google the government of china and goldman sachs i don t know you got to try you know you got to get out of bed in the morning and put your gloves on and go for it right you got to tell the truth but because by the way in the end no amount of money and no amount of praise from the world s dumb people no amount of fake awards the stupid little merit badges they give the pulitzer prize the nobel prize i ve got a rude scholarship oh shut up it doesn t mean anything i got into princeton don t be quiet no that means anything and none of that is worth betraying what you know to be true like that is that is real applause none of that i don t care how much they pay you i don t care how many of your friends on facebook think it s cool for you to repeat the lyrics to their songs when you don t believe them i don t care it is not worth it never betray your conscience and by the way you don t have to agree with me maybe you sincerely disagree with me and i have friends who do sincerely but every person i love and talk to and take seriously is a person of principle who doesn t lie about what he or she believes period period that is essential but let s say even if you do that and you are true to yourself and what you believe to your conscience and your god into the ones you love they went anyway like maybe they continue to get more powerful and maybe the pizza place doesn t come back and maybe in the end jeff bezos sells you your pizza it doesn t taste quite as good but he runs the pizza business now and everything else what if that happens the truth is you re still in charge of what goes on in your head and you re still in charge of the relationships with the people you love that is what you re in charge of so i always think to myself i always think to myself even if in the end they win and in my case you know just being honest probably not going to be treated that well if they win to put it mildly but even if i m living in a double wide trailer in a state i ve never been to in the middle of a cornfield living on social security i m still going to be living with my wife and my kids are still going to love me and i m i mean it all that matters all that matters your family that s it so i know this is a little bit harder it s a little bit easier if you re 51 and you have a job it s a little bit harder if you re not and you re 22 and you re like looking at this world and asking yourself like how do i fit in this how do i end up building a life like the ones that my parents had how do i in a world that clearly hates me and my values how do i succeed and this is something that you know i think about a lot just because i have all these kids and because you know i was a young person and like there s a lot of anxiety in the heart of every 22 year old because you gotta kind of figure out how to live in a society that you don t control and you have to prove yourself and i guess my one piece of advice would be if you can just ignore the standards that they set you don t have to participate in the society that people who hate you and your values created that s the truth i never thought i d be standing on a stage suggesting that people opt out of the popular society but that is exactly what i m suggesting i mean it i mean it if you feel i read that there was a piece in the new york post yesterday by a kid who some of my children know actually who had gone to princeton for three years he went to you know some expensive boarding school then he went to princeton he was there for three years he wrote a piece of the new york post and he s like you know the whole thing was shallow and basically it didn t learn anything i just i went there to get the merit badge of going to princeton it turns out everyone else princeton was there for the same reason they just want to work at some soulless finance company and get rich get a house in aspen and call it a day and i found that totally shallow and disgusting and it violated my values and like the whole thing was a sham like this supposedly impressive meritocracy that they created wasn t impressive at all the closer i got i realized that all these people were supposed to be really smart were actually completely banal and ordinary and we re just hoping that nobody noticed there were no original thinkers at all everyone was just a drone as he goes i moved to australia so i was like you go drop out princeton kid and then the last graph he s like but i m going back to princeton because you know got to get a princeton degree and i m like really no you don t need to go back to princeton and by the way you don t need to go to princeton either if you believe the system is kind of a joke then don t participate in it i mean that applause and what s going to happen is this is another reason that no one my age ever wants to have dinner with me because i always say this at the table and they re all deeply offended but the truth is that the entire american upper middle class or professional class is completely vested in these symbols of attainment of achievement which don t actually connote real attainment or achievement in other words going to princeton doesn t make you smart it doesn t mean you learned anything it just meant you follow the rules the very narrow specific rules designed to make you a perfect bank employee and maybe that s what you want to be and if you want to work at goldman go ahead and go to princeton and that s awesome and invite me to ski and aspen next year great but let s say you don t want that don t participate in it well the problem is that when people start saying that it really offends their parents because and i ll tell you exactly why not because most parents believe their kids are learning anything in college because they know they re not but because i mean let s be honest hayden s a duke just you know what i mean that s like the kind of thing that every parent wants to say at a cocktail party yeah hayden s a duke he s on the lacrosse team i mean you know got a kind of perfect score in the sat i mean he s pretty bright i ll be honest like maybe you have to be 50 to know what that means but trust me that s the goal of everybody my age is to be like hayden s a duke you know he you know he got into pen but we just felt like duke was was better there s no reference at all to what hayden is learning at duke by the way nothing not one thing and instead is like being taught to hate america hate his parents hate the system that made duke possible and no one wants to admit it so clearly this whole system has run its course so it s very easy to say that to be like oh the system is stupid and and we need to fix it and higher education should be impressive and it was with the gi bill and we trained generations of americans to you know be more productive and happier and better compensated than their parents that s all true but at a certain point when we all know this and those of you are in college already know it very well you re living it at a certain point it got completely subverted by bad people and the rest of us who are the ones who send the money in to keep this whole ludicrous operation moving like refuse to acknowledge it and we re like we just want hayden to get into duke let s just be clear you know what it means we can tell our friends and we allowed it to continue and the truth is and you know this there s no fixing it no if you want to be a veterinarian or an engineer or whatever there are all kinds of you know higher education paths that are necessary i mean if you re gonna you know drill my bicuspids i want you to go to dental school i m not you know i m not against education but the liberal arts conventional i want a communications degree from penn state no you don t i m sorry you don t you don t and it will be worth nothing you re going to be deeply indebted and there s a very good chance that it will hurt you is the truth that it will hurt you and this is the last thing i ll say but so i ve thought this for a long time no one i know my age agrees with me they think i m crazy for saying this so i had one of my kids had a friend who was very very bright i always thought he was bright in high school kids really smart and but a little weird but smart and very smart and so this i said to them right before they graduated high school i was like do you you know plan to go to college well yeah of course you know that s what you do in america you go to college like what you didn t go to college and i said all right you know have fun or whatever so like two months later my son calls me and it s like you know he s not doing that well in college i was like well of course he s not doing well in college he s like an original free thinker they hate that that s like the last thing you can be in college someone with unauthorized opinions who dares say them out loud like not allowed and so i called the kid and i was like how s college well i don t really like it and i was like you know you ve been there for three months or whatever you should drop out and come work for me and he s like well i m only 18 i was like i don t care and so he did now i m not gonna he probably will see this and i m deeply embarrassed but the truth is that was five years ago he still works for me and no i m just saying like he turned out to be you know one of the best people that we had now the truth is the job that i put him in was perfectly suited for his natural ability which is really important and no one ever says that either one of the big lies of higher education is you can like go to school and learn to do something that you have no basic aptitude in that s a total lie you could send me to 20 years of mit i would never understand physics i just wouldn t i can t do math i m dyslexic done do the thing for which you re naturally suited pay attention to who you are do the thing that you are naturally good at that you love without being prompted that you would do for free that s totally true don t lie to yourself the biggest lie is oh well you can be whatever you want to be what no you can t you can take the skills that god gave you and you can use them to maximum effect that s true so anyway this kid and i probably shouldn t even be saying this because unfortunately it s 100 true but this kid had the skills required for the job that we put him in and he s turned out to be like an utter star and he s 24 married and and has like you know four years of work experience that no one his age has he ran with it so you can t tell me there s a school in the world that for the price will give you the benefit of four years of being in the right job now you have to find someone who s going to hire a high school graduate who you know drinks a lot and you have to find a job that suits you but if you can you should just because they do it this way doesn t mean you need to keep doing it this way and just because they require you to violate your most deepest your deepest held beliefs the things that you really care about your loyalty to your family to your faith just because they require you to violate all of that doesn t mean you have to you do not have to and you should not and i don t care how many guidance counselors tell you well you got to do this no i don t no i don t the only way we re going to live in a free country is if the people who live in the country act like it s a free country music that s the truth it is the truth and no one you vote for can make it a free country what a lie that is and i like some politic not very many but i know them all that s for sure i mean i ve lived in dc for 35 years and some are better than others and a few were pretty good like you d have dinner with them very few but all of them tell you if you vote for me you ll be freer and happier and that s a complete lie that s a complete lie only you can be free and make yourself free and the only way you do that is by living as a free person period and if you have to take less money or move to some place you ve never been before in order to do that you should do that don t play along i m sure i m going to wreck the light probably like three people in this audience were like yeah i m gonna do that it s a huge risk to do that i hope there are more than three because i really really mean it the old systems are going away don t play along anyway sorry now i m rambling and i m out of time but i i no because my thoughts are so okay okay hold on this guy where s the where s the weird kid has been heckling me do you have a question didn t you guys have a que i ll take one question yes that our country so thank you for that so let me um i ll repeat the question which is basically they re telling you to be quiet there s an enormous amount of pressure on you to conform how do you how do you speak in a world like that and i would say i think if that s a fair summation and i would say i m in a very fortunate place because i m paid to talk so it doesn t take a great deal of bravery when you have a tv show to say what you think because like that s the job and it s amazing how many people are afraid to just do the basic job like if you have a contract to the tv network and you re lying why are you doing that you re under contract you see whatever you want and you should you should say exactly what you think period like again back to the life is short thing like it s life is way too short to pretend you think something you don t like what s the advantage in that sucking up to the mob and being like oh really i m on your side spare me they re going to eat you in the end anyway be a man tell the truth so but how did but that s but that s that s very easy i mean i ll just say like that s it s a pretty low risk proposition for me i m just being totally honest about it like it s not it doesn t take a lot of bravery for me to do that because that s what i m supposed to be doing and i m so grateful for it it takes a lot of bravery if you re a young person in a system controlled by people who hate you and demand obedience to speak up against them it really really does it takes it takes too much and people can t do it and i understand why and i hope i d be brave enough to do it but i don t know because i m not a kid in 2020 and i m so grateful that i m not but i would say this if you you know if you want to change things if you really want to change things that s honestly what it takes it does it doesn t take violence it doesn t even take voting most of the time we don t get to vote that much once every two years mostly what it really takes is just small acts of personal courage and conviction like no i m not i m sorry i m not going along with that i don t need to get in your face i don t need to give you something long i mean i talk to people all the time like well i would speak up but i m not you know i don t know the issues very well or i m not super articulate fine i mean that s okay but it doesn t take some long soliloquy you d have to stand on a desk and be like you know four score and seven years ago you don t have to do that often it s enough of like no i can t do that i m sorry i just don t believe that and i m not gonna pretend that i do you know that s all that s all it takes and you don t need to be confrontational about it you don t need to be a jerk or be loud i mean some of the most powerful examples through history which i know you re very familiar with have been quiet people who just refuse to obey at a certain point because it s too much that was certainly true in the early church it was true the best parts of the civil rights movement it s always been true like the people with deep moral courage don t need to call too much attention to themselves they just need to stop obeying and so i would i would recommend that to everybody but i also recognize the costs are very real and again it s easy for a guy with a job contract to give that advice it s like whoa no you know you go first and so that s kind of what i was getting at in a not very articulate way when i said well maybe you need to opt out and go do your own thing i mean honestly i think it s worth it if you look ahead in your life and you decide what i really want to have is a stable family and that s the only thing that s worth having in my opinion i know a lot of rich people a lot and i ve never met one who s like you know i really got happy when i got rich like it really brought joy to my i ve never met one person who said that better than being poor being poor will make you unhappy there s no doubt about that i m not sort of romanticizing poverty but i know for a fact that getting rich will not it won t ring your bell i m sorry it just won t and no person who s ever gotten rich will ever tell you otherwise not one person so the only thing that makes you happy is a happy family that s it and that s just true this is not you know christian evangelism it s just like fact based social science and so if you really believe that then you need to work toward that goal without being distracted by it any other thing that gets in your way like anything that prevents me from at the end of the day having a happy family and like kids who love me and a spouse who loves me like who doesn t want that everybody wants that and we live in a world where it s like no it s kind of embarrassing to raise your own kids like what you re not what do you do you re not working if you actually talk to people in their surveys and it s like what do people really want they kind of want to raise their own kids actually they don t want to hire someone from a far away country do they want to raise their own kids like why is that you know that s like the most natural thing there is like why wouldn t they want that and guess who doesn t want you to raise your own kids the people who are living off of your labor the people who think you should be at work making widgets to help the stock price like they re not why they don t care about your kids by the way their spouses are home raising their kids because they can afford they can do whatever they want but they don t want you to oh i get it you re working against the happiness of my family and the future of my children so you re my enemy actually you re my and how else do you describe that you re my enemy you re working to hurt my family you re making it impossible for me to raise my own children i mean what does it take that s like that s like a spiritual home invasion that s like such an act of hostility nothing else comes close to that calling me mean names i don t care keeping me from raising my own kids like that s a basic violation there s nothing more basic than that so if you really believe that then you should just take out all the stops and just try and live it i mean it and you ll win in the end thank you for having me music

you touched upon is the bureaucracy of water right uh you know you have the federal government we have a state agency we have local irrigation differences and stuff like that can you you know for our listeners who don t understand the bureaucracy of water can you kind of give us an overview of of kind of the state s you know bureaucracy and the local government s bureaucracy kind of on how waters divvied up in the state yeah look i there s i think about close to 20 or if not a little over 20 different agencies that touch on on water issues we have the department of water resources we have the water resources control board we have the department of fish and wildlife uh we have the um the local water boards we have the water commission there s just there s so many agencies that touch on different aspects from the allocation of water to water rights which the water resources control board is responsible for to infrastructure infrastructure for local communities infrastructure for a state you know statewide water supply like like dan s and whatnot so there s there s a lot of bureaucracy that look um just last year we had uh there was an attack on a on a water treatment plant in the bay area and and it it it was an attack on it was a cyber attack and so this is what um less water supply around the world is going to create these types of challenges and if we re already beginning to see that those kinds of attacks in the state and we re not protected um we re way behind and we need to have a a system in in california that works and that protects uh the limited water supply and that protects californians in every aspect that you can possibly think of because climate change is going to create just exactly those types of scenarios and if not it s going to make it worse right you know that s interesting you know you re kind of talking about your canal bill and then you listed all those 20 agencies and you know i just started you know getting anxiety thinking about how to work with all those agencies to try to achieve something kind of you know there s got to be a way to simplify this kind of what kind of what are your thoughts to kind of streamlining this kind of bureaucracy to make it you know easier to achieve you know goals that work for all californians well look i m going to be honest and say that i wish that i had the perfect solution or the answer to that and the reality is that um that i that i don t because i don t know exactly every detail of the job that uh someone that works in dwr or someone that works at the wall you know at the water resource control board or or the epa and so why i think that the whole goal of sb1219 is to bring this interagency work group together to be able to say okay this is what this these are the different departments this is where we can kind of um maybe we need some reorganization in this area or i mean that s the whole point of it is that how how can we how can they the experts of that do the day to day work um that see all the issues and challenges but also the they have to see also the potential solutions to how do you better uh work together and make sure that it s that it s simple you know yeah a couple of months ago we had dr marty ralph come on a climatologist kind of talk about atmospheric rivers and he was kind of going over kind of uh you know working with the federal government a lot of a lot of things dealing with water are a bit antiquated you know dealing from the 1960s and things like that and i guess you know in dealing with the you know the state water system especially the state water control board kind of you know how are you finding how it s antiquated and how maybe it might be you know able to kind of bring it up to modern times to help us deal with today s challenges well every day i learned something new i will admit and i ll say that just the the fact that we have cyber attacks to try to poison water i mean who would ever thought in the 1960s and and some laws even earlier that something of the sort would even happen where with just you know a little uh moving of your computer you can poison an entire community s water we didn t have that in mind and that s why there s a major need to modernize uh this i ve also been working in um trying to learn a little bit more about the role that nasa is playing in terms of the research that they re doing and studying the the future of deltas and water management and uh you know there s just so much research that people are working on that we need to just find more information there s a lot of technology out there that nasa is also working on and trying to measure water availability so these are all the types of things that we need to kind of bring in and and uh you know figure out what what additional needs we may have maybe the technology and the tools that are being worked on at the moment are not enough that they need to be improved and how do we improve those but i think we have a system in place that we we don t even know how much water is being uh perhaps stolen or where exactly water is going that s you know all information that we need to be able to to collect and improve on but the tools and the resources uh are there s tools and resources out there already that we could bring in but i also think we need to look at the future what additional tools and resources we need to be looking into as well make sure you click the button below and subscribe and hit that notification bell so you can keep up with all our news and updates,"water system,poison

streaming and music through the night that our flag was still there oh say does that star spangled applause land of the applause breaks applause we unleash the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than is therefore freedom did the individual have been more available than in any other place on earth for this freedom at times has been high we have never been unwilling to pay that price it does require however our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great to believe that together with god s help we can and will resolve the problems which now confronts we are americans music applause music applause music music good morning good morning hey listen stay stay standing stay standing father we come before you god we ask you to take this day you created it you established it and lord i know that we re a people that have been gathered together who love this country not everywhere in this room are watching we understand that but father we pray right now that the reality of who you are the grandeur of this nation that you gave us and the fact that you re alive gives us ultimate hope we ve talked a lot about this last week regarding in the things that are valuable to us and we must admit that these things that we hold dear are things that you have always been righteous freedom liberty love kindness forgiveness grace mercy salvation father we give you this time and we ask it in jesus name and all god s people said amen now you can be seated god bless you guys it s great to see you good to see you you guys want to shout on the count of three it s merry christmas right they re already starting it over here i want to hear it loud we re not going to let the culture rob us of shouting christmas right one two three merry christmas charlie brown for sure amazing so we look at our nation and all that s going on around us and we must re i m hearing all week the fact that this nation has been founded in a way that no other country on earth can boast obviously there s the correlation with the united states and israel you open up the bible and you see that god called israel out of slavery that he established them upon his word the bible and that all the way through whenever god wanted to bring his people back he brought them back to the bible back to the word of god we saw in the days of nehemiah when israel had been taken captive that they returned to the word we saw that with ezra they returned to the word every time we see a reawakening it s the returning to the word of god friends listen i know that there may be somebody who will say i love this country but not not the god that you talk about and that s okay i want you to hear something the god that i rep today is the god that the bible says is all creator and that the bible says he is love that he is grace that he has forgiveness but that he is holy and this is why what you and i are standing for matters now look i m a pastor so i m i m i m allowed to say what i m about to say woke pastors need to either change their biblical world view or go look for another job up or you need to get out by all means we need to get back to the bible back to the word of god again and you say well what makes you say that this nation s history makes listen when we talk about our founding fathers we need to understand that when we read our founding father to talk about their founding fathers did you know that listen adams jefferson washington talked about the founding fathers you say jack wait a minute i thought those guardian fathers they are our founding fathers but when they were beginning this nation they leaned back upon the pilgrim experience look just a couple weeks ago we celebrated thanksgiving did you realize that in 2021 we celebrated the 400th thanksgiving service that had been conducted in america 400 years ago 400 years ago and this is what s awesome this is what s glorious about it that when the mayflower pulled up before they got off that ship william bradford in the gang half of them believers half of them not they said we re not getting off this ship until we have a governing body of laws and they crafted what is called the mayflower compact now if i was the dictator of education in america nobody would from school unless they had memorized the mayflower compact very big it s not very difficult but i can tell you right there for those who are saying america is not founded upon god man you need to read some history and oh by the way i don t know if it was tucker if it was i know charlie but listen this whole thing about the 1619 project you gotta listen that is so dumb it is so dumb because why stop at 16 19 why don t you go back to 1605 when reverend hunt came to this country to this continent and preached the gospel when he landed in what was parts of virginia or would be virginia 1605 ladies and gentlemen host 16 19 16 19 that was a focus on a bunch of people who came here for prisons and not for god reason most of it failed until you get to the 1620 landing of the pilgrims and why did they succeed everybody you need to know this i think you do i m just saying it anyway in 1620 is when they came because it was rooted in faith it wasn t rooted in anything else and how do you know that the mayflower says this it says right there that we have come in the name of our king and our god to this continent to spread the gospel of jesus christ it s in the mayflower compact and to back that up everybody in plymouth massachusetts there is a massive pillar and that pillar which nobody rarely ever stops to see is the founders monument and it s all a way around label by the characteristics and attributes of what makes a great nation and this is what they believed they believe that this is what makes a great that you re educated from education dispels barbarous acts if you re educated that you should be merciful to one another that you should love each other because with that you can establish a country based upon laws that there s there s a god in heaven that we live and conduct our lives understanding that he s holy and we re not that that is to be that god s word would be the guiding light you just heard that tape played again that audio bugging again and you know everybody says oh reagan said that this we need to make this nation city on the shining hill listen john winthrop said that reagan knew that and reagan quoted john winthrop who was the first governor of the pilgrim colony founded upon the word of god now look you don t have to become a follower of this country that s how amazing our founders were they knew the lord but what they did is that they created a nation where even the atheists would have the freedom to exercise their atheism that s how much freedom we ve got it s amazing but we look around and listen everybody it s been referenced look i m i m it s the last day i don t have much to say you guys have already heard it all and i m telling you though right now that what we ve been hearing it will be a crime if we leave this facility and we do not determine to put into practice what we ve been learning this week we have got to do it charlie mentioned on the opening day charlie mentioned something that i wonder if you got it and believe it or not it was probably one of the most powerful things said he said you need to run for school board you need to run for pta you need to know how much power you can have in those entities because like many have said politics is local oh and one word about politics so aren t you a pastor you shouldn t talk about politics let me put it to you this way the bible says that god invented government in the book of leviticus he invented government it s repeated in the book of exodus throughout the bible god is the given you know what happens to government when man takes control of it without seeking god he makes it into politics man makes the politics god has established the government government is where you and i have enjoyed for 400 years and that we had the freedom to worship we had the freedom and the prosperity and the education to not only be blessing one another but to bless the entire world ladies and gentlemen we all if you live in arizona i live in southern california obviously a border state listen here s the deal i was down at the border with federal agents and i asked an agent how many people do you have to deal with that are breaking into he said you mean california and i said no how many people do you have to deal with that are breaking into mexico from california and he said man i don t understand your question he said oh i get i get it nobody breaking into mexico from california this country is still the greatest hope on earth as messed up as it is it s still the greatest home people are breaking into this country because hope is what the bible talks about listen king david when he saw that his nation was falling apart in psalm 11 he cried out and he said you were asking me to fountain of the lord he said what am i to do and what shall the righteous do when the foundations are removed our nation s foundations have been shaken by those who do not believe in our constitution they do not believe in the god of the bible they do not believe in individual responsibilities or freedoms and they ve imposed make no mistake about it they have imposed their deity upon us their deity is tyranny their deity is made up of a bunch of little demigods that they call the shots a handful of those who are the power brokers and i want you to know something jesus called that nicolaitans if you re familiar with your bible just the works of the nicolaitans which i hate jesus said that and the word nicolaitans means those that lord over the people god wants you to connect with him personally god wants this nation there s still hope for this nation to turn back and listen i gotta tell you i love our military i love this nation from a marine uh i gotta tell you uh i fight for this country right now i m old but i m gonna go down swinging but i gotta tell you this everybody i got to tell you this it s the the strength is not in the military the strength is not in the white house the strength is not in the state house the strength is in god when we we see god he will respond and let s all let s all agree right now that we re in a desperate moment of time this is the first time in human history that what s going on in the world is happening to the world at the exact same time we need to wake up and realize something s up didn t tucker say it the other day when yes he said it s spiritual he hit the nail on the head you guys know uh j r r tolkien author of lord of the rings how did the lord of the rings come about in token s mind tolkien saw world war one and tolkien being a soldier said to himself there is no way this can be happening warring with man there s got to be demon invisible forces that are behind man killing man and he invented he gave us the lord of the rings i got news for you tucker was exactly right the issue is spiritual but i m gonna differ with tucker and i i don t know him i hope he s not here uh don t tell him i said this but uh look i m sure you love montana like everybody else loves montana but uh he he was encouraging you to go build a cabin somewhere i m i m inviting you to move to california and put on your battle gear you need to come come fight we don t go listen don t don t run to some place go get us if you want fine come and that s what charlie s all about listen i know that i m old enough to be charlie s dad but i got to tell you i pray for the strength of charlie kirk to be a clear joy and hip on making then knowledgeable his freedoms are and that god in heaven his freedoms and you guys check this out i got a few moments left so david looked around and he said what is the righteous to do when the foundations are removed our foundations are being removed we re being attacked what do we do you do the same thing that david did and that all have done from the ages when everything looks impossible you turn and you look up and you say god look down from heaven and have mercy god have mercy upon us listen friends our nation california specifically now has sanctioned abortion our governor is saying i fear the overturn of roe v wade and so i sense that that s coming this is newsome he senses that the roe v wade ruling is going to be overturned that abortion is going to be abolished so he s doubling down and he is announcing to america that california will be your abortion destination state applause guess what we re doing dear god in heaven either save gavin newsom or give us a new governor but by all means please don t let that happen applause when the foundations are shaken maybe in life your foundations have been shaken i thank god for listen i know it sounds crazy man but i thank god for there s a lot of people in california that have not bowed the need to fouchy i mean and not bowed the need to fear applause we understand it s flu season happens every year here s the deal when we are told by politics not government you can t gather you can t sing out loud isn t it funny you can t sing out loud you can t you can t gather together listen the more i read my bible and read my bible the more i understood if that s what i m hearing from politics then it s time to obey god rather than man it s time for us to do the right thing and so for us today your life there s no doubt in a room this size that you ve lost someone this last year it s it s possible you ve known somebody who died from covid cancer heart attacks old age we all have but what about you the moment we hear about death isn t it a faith isn t amazing everybody s afraid of death all of a sudden in the whole world you re not allowed to get sick nobody s allowed to die wear a mask wrap yourself in bubble wrap and stay home you can t get sick why because you could die well we re all going to die the point is to the gospel is that for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever him would not perish but have everlasting life listen we re all we re all gonna we re all going to die we re all going to die here s the deal you got to get ready before you die jesus said if somebody dies believe even forever jesus said i am the way the truth and the life and no man comes to the father but through me isn t that narrow yeah that s so narrow you bet it s narrow son died once on the cross never to die there again to make a way of salvation for you it s free it cost them everything but it s free to you so the number one thing about turning back america is that we get on our knees that s how we fight do we run for office absolutely do we vote knowing the candidates absolutely always look at their voting records never listen to them listen never listen to candidates when they don t listen to them voting records their voting records never lie they ll lie through their teeth but the voting record never lies so you you vote smart you pray you get involved because here s here s what you do at the end of the day for one you make sure that when all this is over someday it s all going to be done going to come to the end of your life or the end of your moment and you re going to want to make sure that jesus christ is the lord of your life wisdom you being a good person ain t gonna cut it if you could be good enough to get to heaven then why did jesus die on the cross listen he he died for jerks like me he died for sinners like me it s him and listen you want your soul secure because you rise from that and you go forward doing the right thing well you guys in california you just had a the largest recall in american history against your governor that s right but you wound up losing listen it was the biggest recall in american history it was awesome here s the deal would we like to have won yes but here s the deal we stood for what s right and at the end of time we get to look god in the face and say we did what s right and listen i i invite you to say yes to jesus christ our only hope he s enough he s all that you need and when the foundations are shaken he ll stand strong god bless you guys applause music how s everybody doing it is a great time to be an american i m corey deangelis i m from the american federation for children and it s also a great time to be a school choice advocate the teachers unions have finally overplayed their hand showed their true colors and in a way inadvertently done more to advance the concept of homeschooling parental rights and educational freedom than anyone could have ever imagined we should give everybody a round

set up a brand new text message for this you text get involved all one word to seven seventeen seventy six all one word to seven seventeen seventy six and a member of our team will reach out to a i ll see you out there we should fund students directly not the system anybody heard of the the national association i mean before this year it s like no one really knew what it was it s like why does the national school board association even exist in the first place but it turns out that there s been pushback here too on the part of parents it it s a good idea to label parents as domestic terrorists for pushing back at the school board meetings and since they put out that statement to the biden administration essentially labeling and suggesting that some parents should be labeled as domestic terrorists 18 states have already voted to defund the national school board association parents are taking their power back and it can happen at the state and local level we re seeing that with the national school board association i mean at this point can we even call it the national school board association 18 states have already left they ve lost already over 42 percent of their state level funding maybe we ll call it the regional school board association or something at this point because at this point uh people are understanding that it doesn t make any sense so let s continue join us in the fight to fund students not systems you can go to the educationfreedompledge com or for short if you want to go to ed edfreedompledge com help us join the fight to fund students not systems at the american federation for children thank you guys so much have fun applause music america is the greatest country that we have ever seen i was able to receive information and realize that we do not live in a racist country i get so sick and tired of being sick of these idiotic people you should have an ounce of respect for anybody claiming black lives matter at this point when they don t give a flying fear about black police officers they don t care about black conservatives see a lot of you and tell you what you want to hear and then you ll buy it and switch it up that s the problem

be is to put god first in everything you do put god first in everything you do everything that i have accomplished who i am who some of you believe that i am i ve seen a lot of you some of you had tears in your eyes saying you changed my life all of that is because i put god first all that you will achieve in life all of your aspirations and dreams that thing that s sitting right there in your heart telling you to go for it before all odds tell me you stop worry about what your parents say about you and you go for it some of y all a question of whether or not you should drop out of school and pursue your passion maybe that s you the thing that s burning on the inside some of y all need to go back to school some of you need to pursue your dreams in school some of you guys may want to start a youtube channel like beat tatum but before you do any of that make sure you have god first now i believe that my life is a testimony to the things that i say i wasn t always like this and i say this a lot of times when i speak people don t recognize me wouldn t recognize me if they knew who i was before this i had a badass if you say the wrong thing to me we ll fight i had you i got a young savage tattooed across my stomach if my six pack game was was all right on point i ll show y all but my my wife the meals and then you know hey i want y all to see that side of me but i still have gold teeth in my mouth i got my hood tattooed on my forearm and it took god to revolutionize who i was and changed me in 2008 when i got saved how many people here say i was racist i was racist now i look back on it we used to have a disdain when i was growing up for white people we thought white people hated us and that i had to work four five or six times harder than the white man to achieve i used to believe that police officers were racist white people that just pulled over black people for no reason i used to believe that crowd i used to believe all of it passionate about the things i say today is because i used to be that guy i used to be that person and when i make these videos i m quit being lazy quit making excuses you can be anything you want to be in this country if you work hard and they tell this big lie about our country and our founding i believe that the constitution was inspired through these men by god the problem was and it s just like the bible today is whether or not we applaud the things that were written people say the constitution ain t for the black man constitution we re in the constitution where say white whites only i see nowhere in the pledge of allegiance where it says whites only it don t exist the only problem we struggle with in our country i think we struggle within our faith sometimes is actually applying what was written he didn t want to take he didn t want to take away the constitution united states of america he didn t want to eradicate it he didn t want to get rid of it he wanted us to live up to it live up to the promises that we made don t let these folks lie to you there s no division amongst us we re all one we re all the children of god don t let them lie to you we ve been working together since the very beginning we ve been working together since the very beginning what do you think harriet tubman was doing she was going to lala land having these black people go with her to lala land it s a mysterious place no there were white people who work with her rich their lives so that black people could be free when the vote to free black people in this country of slavery give them citizenship and the right to have a vote those things were voted on by white people i don t know how they missed that we didn t have a right to vote how we gonna vote on our right to vote but there were good white people and they won t they don t want you to believe it there were good white people who never believed that anybody should be a slave they understood the purpose that we had in our country another myth that eats me alive sometimes is the myth that police officers and the police department around the country systemically racist it s a lie it is a lie i was a police officer of arizona in tucson we have any tucsonians in here y all represent for a little town i see you but i was a police officer in tucson never met a racist cop not one time i met some lazy ones i met some ugly ones but i never met a racist cop all the men and women that i went to the briefing and debriefing with we loved one another we would die for one another and it wasn t just words it s not just words that s the problem today people just talk it s lip service we literally went out every day and put our lives on the line for one another in real life and i had one guy be racist towards me he i went on a call he was a he s a say he s a white supremacist he couldn t whoop me if we had a fight so i don t know what his white supremacy would do for him but uh i go to the co says i don t want a black man taking my case report before i could even open my mouth my partner got on his real fast real fast i thought i was gonna have to break him up i thought he was gonna fight the guy that to me tells me that the majority of us will never accept hatred and racism does it exist in america yeah some fools in a cornfield somewhere run around in circles that s probably the extent of racism in america to me in my opinion it has no power and let me tell you this it s a phrase that i use um i made a shirt with a with a title on it because i believe it s an invaluable concept i don t believe in white privilege i believe in christ s privilege why do you say that mr tatum because they re in a single racist white man system whatever you want to call it that can stop what god is already playing in your life it doesn t matter what color you are police officers interact with about 300 million people a year and only a thousand result in the death of somebody you could do the math i m not a mathematician hundred million and one thousand that s some that s some numbers i can t even calculate the computer may put an e on it right the same as covet i didn t say it i didn t say it youtube don t blame me so but it s a myth that they re out here just killing black men and they re out here just thugging it s not true i was on the swat team you you rarely get into a deadly force situation as a police officer i know police i was good at a whole career anybody how have i had to put my gun on people yes have i had to put the hands on people yes have i had to chase people i caught everybody except one guy one dude only reason i didn t catch him i had my rifle in my hand he had some skinny jeans on he was gone i was like yeah damn hope nobody got this on camera but anyway the message today is for you to be inspired you guys said i mean this is the coldest event that i ve ever been to y all agree charlie kirk man he younger than me and he doing it big greatest event i love coming to because i see america at these events i see people of all races all backgrounds all ages all dispositions whatever you name it i see them and we are all together these people who hate us these lunatics on the left hey cause they don t have happiness they can t do anything like this because the first black man show up on their event gonna be crying about oppression and slavery and a thousand years ago black men would stop all that crap stop all that crap you guys should be empowered to do great being inspired have some passion about what you do in life i don t care what your background is i didn t come from a perfect background my parents weren t perfect my life story wasn t perfect i got kicked out of school when i was a senior trying to fight a teacher i threw a chair she was she messed up that time i got arrested when i was eight years old smoking marijuana in a vacant house with my cousins my life i did a whole bunch of stuff i regret but that don t stop you from taking advantage of the 24 hours and i hope that when you leave here you leave here a different person than the person you came here as i hope that you ve been meeting people you ve been connecting with people that live in your state outside of your state people you would normally talk to i m hoping that you re connecting because when you go back wherever you go to school wherever you live that s infiltrated with these brain dead that you have a friend to reach out to that you ve met a new friend to replace these fake people i want you to understand this and i know a lot of y all have lost friends quote unquote y all have

to the slaves in this country were for me they went through so i could have life and so black people can have life here in america and it was a tough road but god threw them an opportunity we should be grateful for that s all i got to say we should be grateful i m glad i live in america i hate they have to go through it but i m glad i live in america i hate that christ had to die on the cross but i m glad that i m saved i m gonna start preaching where where the offering pray that pass the offering around it ain t about you when i get discouraged and i say man i m tired of this boy i m tired of people on social media any people that follow me sometimes i ll be wanting to turn it all off and i say it ain t about me how am i gonna get so worked up how am i gonna get so emotional about my friends when jesus died it wasn t a figurative death it wasn t an illusion he got beat he took it and he wasn t even wrong he didn t do nothing wrong he was telling the truth just like y all telling the truth and they didn t want to hear it just like they don t want to hear it but you know what he said i don t care 30 years old he had a long life he said it s time for me to take this punishment

marathon runners so give it a hand for chad right again we ve got a ranger right here rangers lead the way right actually we have two of them we ve got ryan collector he s an author ranger a sniper and uh the list could go on and on but thank you for being here with us today and then if you don t know john down at the end also a ranger and uh a true america a chance talking a little bit yesterday an honor to have him as well um we re going to jump into this conversation because you don t want to hear from me we re going to we re going to hear from these guys one thing we re dealing with in law enforcement and i know that this is probably the case in the military as well we re seeing a rise of these guys probably don t know the term woke ism or woke because they live in a whole different warrior world than we do uh but we re seeing that liberal woke ism out in them across this country i wanted to ask you guys i ll start with you john because i know you ve got some opinions on this what does how is that liberal wokism affecting the military and the people coming into the military the ranks of the military a great question it s devastating in numerous ways one is i think it steals the hearts of soldiers i mean a soldier is supposed to be ready to die in defense of their country but if if pervasive woken this ideology convinces them that our country is evil that we re all white supremacists xenophobic land stealing fascists why in the world in that you know i i it really if you re defending entry that makes you evil and so why in the world would the soldier die end of country and so it literally erodes the whole foundation of what a soldier is supposed to do we can t survive that third thing that uh this leftism does to the military uh is it s just gonna get people killed is we shameful retreat from afghanistan and it literally i know yeah and it s literally cost the lives of innocent people that some of those americans some of them innocent suffering under uh tyrannical terrorism it s costing people s lives and it s also a signal the rest of the world that america is weak and vulnerable you surely you guys have been gearing up in russia arena gearing up they re not playing woke gender games they re getting ready to take over and dominate and that should alarm this is going to literally get people killed it already is uh and the third thing is what this wokeism is doing is it s eviscerating with the mass evacuation of the special operations community that s our community we re former special operations soldiers all of us uh and here s the fact for you i know a grand total of zero operations guys zero don t exist and and it s to be in that community that we re connected to requires a certain level of down to earth realism also a certain amount of intelligence uh pragmatism uh and uh resilience to bullying you can t believe and so when this left this comes out it s simple it s kind of like and then they just get out i ve gotten so many resumes from seals and rangers and special forces guys that want to come work with the warrior poet society doing training or doing some of our content i get resumes all the time because they refuse to ideology and they re getting run out of the military that s what s happening i was so busy trying to get chad s intro right i forgot about the warrior post society so uh ryan do you have anything to add to that well i agree with john i the reason we was not because we were it was because we believed in something we repeatedly volunteered we volunteered for the military in the first place then you volunteer for maybe various schools or various unit assignments and there s something to be said for why we did that it s because we believed in the country we believed in the flag i mean i still do i don t mean to make it sound that way but there was a never the magic that i felt when i was saluting the flag and knowing just that the swelling of pride i had within me and when you re overseas when you re deployed i deployed a couple times to afghanistan about your time 2001 i was in afghanistan right there s something to be said about that girl back home for the soldier there s something we said about that family back home that you know you re protecting you re there for and when we tell these guys and women that what they re fighting for isn t worth fighting for what do we think great point chad yeah great point guys let me add just something on to that these woke agendas are actually available in the circles of special operations communities let me tell you what we used to do with vaccines when i was a seal operator we d walk into the medical office do you want this vaccine we said yes or no if we said no trash can and we d sign the paperwork this crap is freaking laughable to me man that s how we look man come on and let me tell you what china russia iran they can do whatever they want because i am still convinced that we the people of america have the strongest most dedicated most capable most highly trained operators on the face of the freaking earth man so tell them to bring it son they got nothing on us bring it look that s where we re at let me tell you the problem with these agendas when you re in combat you gotta deal deal with problems within the boundaries of reality you have to accept reality in combat you have to accept the situation for what it is man and let me tell you when you ask me to say that a man can be a woman or now all this crap when you ask me to do that you know what you re asking me to do you re asking me to partake in an alternate reality you re that s what you re doing you re asking me to partake in an alternate reality that is is is not possible in terms of human biology or the laws of nature negative there is an all out war on your perspective of reality and we have a large percentage of our population that are living in an alternate reality if you can convince me to say that people of the same sex can produce a child what else can you convince me to say you can convince me to say whatever you wanted me to say it s about reality man we have to return to reality what is real what is real send it son yeah buddy yeah that s what i m talking about i love it we asked back there if we could do a mic drop we had to catch it if we drop it but that was a bike drop and you know what on top of backwoods navy seal uh wizard hermit reverend chad right right that was fired up man i love my country man i love it too and you know love you guys chad brings up a good point what is our resolve as americans to fight for what we love which is the freedom that we that these men have fought whose friends have died for freedom we have and uh it s an honor to listen to these guys the passion they have for america should be the passion that you leave this this conference with a renewed passion um i just wanted to say one quick thing on bad you know because i want to get into leadership but one thing i saw was them leaving afghanistan you may not think it has an effect here in america but i m going to tell you as a sheriff who deals with border security every day when we sent the message to the world that we were too weak hold our in afghanistan who do you think is gonna that s not gonna stop them from coming to this country illegally especially those who would wish harm on our country now what we talk have been saying that the good men and women of law enforcement and they probably won t raise their hand because cops never do but i know out here we got some cops here today thank you guys and i always say the cops are not the ones that didn t hold the line the police officers out there on the streets are holding the line who didn t hold the line the administrators of this profession there s a lack of leadership in this country of people with the fortitude to stand up for what is right and to stand up for the minute when he put on the badge so i want to talk to you about leadership in the military we talked a little bit about the woke ism and i want to talk we ll start with uh ryan this time what is the leadership and how do you see this being an issue in the military well i think i see where some of the problem is coming from when we have leaders like general miley and people like this that are advancing this woke culture agreed they re the ones that are leading the charge on this wokeness in the military that needs to stop and i think the reason is where they come from i mean i ve gone to college since so don t hate me but when i was in the military i was enlisted i didn t go to college first to be an officer you have to go to college and these officers that are in charge are sometimes going to these liberal institutions and they re learning this liberal ideology through college and the more advanced degrees they have arguably the more liberal college they go to sometimes they re promoted better in the military so we have liberals figured it out they beat us to it 30 40 years ago by getting into the colleges first and so when you have general miley there he has the minds at college he doesn t have the mindset starting from being up in the field like us and until we get leaders out there that know what it s actually like to be on the ground i know it s like to be one of the the bottom guys first i don t know if we re going to fix it thank you thank you excellent reverend hold up just a minute let s quit calling these things liberal ideologies and let s start calling them what they are it s freaking evil man evil is the problem there s this weird thing on earth it s this intangible force that we can t see but it s there whether you know it or not and i m gonna go ahead and tell you men like us have seen it and it is called evil right all right and that s what it is it s not a liberal ideology we have to change the way we re talking about these things all right there you can t negotiate with evil evil ain t gonna listen to you you can t make terms with evil you know what you have to do with evil you have to freaking drive it back into the shadows that s what you do with evil screw these people man applause amen battle a good john uh so love what my brother s up here saying but can i get one big round of applause for chad s legs you guys see these things stand up again one more time look at it turn around turn around it s the only sexy thing on my body i i don t know about you guys but i like love what chad s saying i hear about 95 but the other five percent of me is just looking at his legs and just being like thank you john bro bro you knew we were speaking today too you re just kind of like i m gonna wear these shorts i m surprised you can t see him dropping out the shorts oh we re getting way off topic now we gotta reel this hey it s like sad let s back on leadership he said you can t just not say something about that you know very good uh returning to leadership listen the way the world works it just rises and falls on leadership that s just the way it is chad mentioned he believes that the united states has the most elite fighting force that breathes freedom and is ready to lead him and die defending her and i believe that s true i believe that is uh the common soldier i believe that s true with law enforcement as well the good cops out there that s absolutely true uh though i i maintain that s true the weak leader would make it to no real advantage uh and so we have to make sure we have strong leadership uh alexander the great if you don t know him he took over the world by 33 years old quite impressive so he knows something about fighting and he certainly knew something about leadership something amazing about leadership and he said this he said he didn t fear an army of lions by a sheep uh but he did fear an army of sheep led by a lion music let that sink in we cannot survive being led by sheep we can t do it we have to have strong leadership and we the american people soldiers military soldiers cops we have to demand strong leadership and if we don t get it we must get them out we have to we cannot survive weak leadership what the house or whether it s in the top ranks of our military we cannot survive it and we cannot change it until we demand better because we do deserve it and freedom necessitates it excellent excellent and you know this year is our opportunity this is our opportunity to send a rebuking and send real leaders who want to represent america first and i think that s important um we got a lot of folks out here some may have served in the may be active some may be law enforcement how can these people i m gonna start with you chad give them some principles that they can implement that will bring out that america that warrior within agency with inside each and every one of them today oh are y all ready for this son do you guys really want to be warriors do you want to do what warriors do your little story you guys have been hanging out in this conference for the last week and you ve got all this motivation and you ve got all these tools all these ideas and you ve got all these things in your head right that you know need to happen in the seal teams i was a preacher and as a breacher it was my job to build a bomb so that i could blow a hole in the target building so that my team could get in and crush our enemy and every time we would get a target package come down i would go back into the ready room and i would build a bomb and i can t tell you how many hundreds of times i can remember walking up to the target building i was the first person in the patrol and i would take this bomb out of my pack and i would peel the hydrogel off of off the back of it and i would stick it to the wall and i would cap my blasting caps in and i would pay my debt core back to minimum safe distance right and i would look behind me and guess what i would see behind me i would see a bunch of sets of green eyes because it was dark outside and we owned the night i d see a bunch of sets of green eyes and it was my team that was lined up behind me and they were waiting for me to hear three words and you want a tip you want to know what warriors do best you know what you want to know what you need to do when you leave here you need to be thinking about these three words i was waiting for on every target i ever went on as a breacher standing by with my entire team behind me those three words are execute execute execute and that is what warriors do warriors execute execute execute and if you let this knowledge if you let this motivation if you let these ideas die and you don t execute execute execute guess what you re not just cheating yourself you re being selfish and you re cheating your entire nation and you re in cheat you re cheating generations that will follow you generations that are following you are waiting for you to execute execute execute just like every single warrior does on the battlefield and that s what you all need to do when you leave here when you wake up tomorrow morning there needs to be three things going through your head as a matter of fact go ahead and put it in your alarm on your phone so that when that thing goes off in the morning you the phone and your phone tells you to execute execute execute amen brother that s what warriors do that s what sets us apart you don t need no vaccine we just need a little bit of chad s blood in each and every one of us right we ll be all we america be just fine chad i want that as a ringtone will you i will buy that on the app store execute actually my last goes off it s your voice just screaming execute at me i love it brother gotta do it it s the essential ingredient it is the essential ingredient and that is why we are failing right now it s because people won t freaking execute man we got apathetic we got too lazy and now it s time to execute to work john party give us some give us some advice give these guys some warrior advice i m sorry you got to follow chad but i don t understand phrased the question again he just looked at me so i got it we got we got a room full of good americans here yeah how do they implement a warrior lifestyle every day how do they how do they tap into that each and every one of them uh it s been said that a great author love him names g k chesterton he says the soldier doesn t fight because uh he hates what s in front of him it s because he loves what s behind him i think that s so critical and so where i i want to echo yes execute execute execute i think the thing that grounds me to be fearless because that s that s what keeps us from executing right it s fear or or we just don t know what in the world to do right but a lot of times it s fear that paralyzes us uh we don t have one have that awkward conversation or what if i put myself out there and there s consequences and i lose my job or i lose friends or it s an awkward family uh meal or something like that or just debilitated by fear but when i think about the people that i love when i think about the ideals that mean the most to me the things that are worth living for and dying for and that s god that s family that that s country that s everything we stand for when i think about that stuff uh jesus says um perfect love casts out all fear well he said first john uh perfect love casts out all fear um that that s the thing that moves us right and so when i m motivated by love and when i m thinking about those high ideals that s the i think that s the way that we stoke up that courage to master uh that fear and so my encouragement to you guys is this don t let fear steal your life anymore you re good people you re good people god love you for it way to go but part of that means well we re kind of okay to just not make a scene and and be real respectful while the left just wreaks absolute chaos like petulant children screaming picketing whining until they get their way and we re just kind of seeding the field it s kind of like i don t want to i don t want to compete with crazy i m like no we can t afford to give an inch more ground you got to go on the offense you got to have those hard conversations you can t let fear paralyze you anymore and though uh you re not flipping down nods and kicking in doors and blowing uh blowing uh buildings apart like we used to do you are still engaging in the war of ideas and right now we re not in a civil war that we re trying to kill countrymen god forbid we ever get to that please please god protect us from that horrible horrible state but as it is now we re in the war of ideas and you ve got to go on the offense it s not just us we re not going to be able to do it for you it s every person in this room going on the offense in the war of ideas we still be loving we still be respectful but we call a spade a spade and when someone issues this leftist garbage horse crap you re willing to immediately say that is horse crap absolutely not i do not believe in that music thank you john and i want to say john beautiful beautiful point i want to add to that that offense starts with your family and your local community that is where that starts so if you don t have the capacity to run for some congress man or woman or president or whatever it starts in your family and in your local community okay family is the smallest form of government so everyone in here can make a difference everyone in here can execute everyone in here can do what john just encourage you to do don t feel like you re you re out of that you like you don t have the capacity to serve in that manner all right i just think family unity is one of the strengths of america ryan we re running give you a little bit of time but i want to leave save 30 seconds for these guys too to let these folks know where they can follow them what you want your your websites podcasts all that so i would say take care of yourself first before you take care of others it might sound selfish but i mean like the gas mask on an airplane you got to be around and you got to be alive you have to be educated before you can mentor others spiritually go to mentally educate yourself what the topics are take yourself physically you don t have to run for 38 hours straight like chad does but you study in shape right and i ask you to consider moving and taking action before you know exactly what you re doing you can t steer a parked car it has to be moving before you can make some direction right i like to look at life in anything that i ve done anything i ve done that s worked out i started and people ask me how i did it later i i figured it out as i went i look at life like going through hills and valleys out in the woods i m out there at a map maybe or i m navigating i m trying to figure out the way to go well sometimes i m down at the bottom between the mountains and all i see is the trees around me and i can t see the peaks the hills very well and i don t know where to go well sometimes the best way to know where to go is to get up on that hilltop so that takes effort that takes moving that takes walking even though i don t know it s the right and that sometimes in life when i m up on those hilltops and i can look back and i can see where i came and i can see where i m going for me to remember what that terrain looked like because pretty soon i m going to back down again and not see anymore but i got to keep on charging and just move now figure it out as you go later amen move move all right ryan tell them tell everybody where they can find you where they can find your book and then just give me one sentence to sum up what america means to you oh my goodness that s a tough one yeah i might go after john good luck last sentence i have no idea what i m going to say you got to do this in like 20 seconds all right you can find me at gun university com i do myriad projects online with guns and i do them with john i write books i write the long range shooting handbook and stuff like that but university dot com is where it s at go find everything thank you chad where can they find you tell me what i m married yeah guys 37 project dot com the most important thing i can tell you before you leave here today is read your freaking bible and give your heart to jesus that s what drives second timothy 1 7

learn to fear us because we the people are the ones who hold us in power the incompetence of the bible white house cost american lives mr president listen carefully and i ll say it slowly just for you no man left behind that s leadership when it comes to the matter of protecting our friends our family and our heartland do not trifle with this representative democracy for we the people will not stop we will never back down we will give out everything to protect those dear to us our republic finish the wall we are going to be the party that is known to fight when i say that if you think this vasculation of the constitution will be met with silence then you know nothing of the america i know you want my guns i know it we all know it we ll mr speaker music music wow well whoever built this stage i had to say thank you you gave me a great ramp i was like if they put a jump here could have gone straight into the crowd so first and foremost get the most important thing out of the way we all need to thank our lord jesus our lord and savior jesus christ letting us all be here today number two we need to recognize that i have been called a nationalist in the mainstream media i i ve been called somebody who cares only about america and focuses on on this nation uh the rest of the world be damned and i just said they re absolutely right so one i d like to get uh some political matters out of the way so obviously i believe conservatives are poised to take over this country very very soon i m going to have control soon i i believe that and so i want to talk about what we have that control and then i want to speak about really the most important part of what we all can do as americans as this next generation as the leaders of this country to be able to save the country so number one when we take power i think first and foremost our number one priority should be prosecuting anthony falci for lying to congress and putting them on well i believe that we are really the racing in this country is the communist chinese party uh really their their ability to infiltrate our world to infiltrate our country to influence things on the global stage i believe especially all of us in this room we re under 40 years old they will be the enemy that we will be facing uh for the rest of the century i didn t believe that so because of their terrible mishandling of covet 19 allowing it to be released from their country i believe that we should seize all chinese assets in the united states of america as a down payment for what they owe us next i genuinely believe that we need to launch some investigations when we take command one i want to figure out exactly why the nih is torturing puppies in africa number two i want to understand why we are funding gain and function research number three i would like to investigate president joe biden for if if you think about what happened he does not and i i i i ll tell you none of us in this room i think should take any joy in watching the cognitive decline of the president of the united states of america uh but i i will tell you i am so frustrated with dr jill biden his wife to force a man who is obviously going into cognitive mental decline to stand up against people who are going into the prime to where i i just wanted to call him you know happy uncle joe was the vice president one day he could stay off into the sunset but no now we have to go against him and when he disobeyed direct orders from the supreme court of the united states and did an unconstitutional action my friends that s an impeachable offense so so next i i really want to talk about and those are some political things that i think we all can do that s some things i think we can all get behind and advocate for as americans but as we are going into really the the rest of this decade the rest of 2020 i i really feel like the 1920s set the tone for all of the 20th century a lot of the things that happened you saw all these revolutions with socialism saw those revolutions with communism all across the country and i think it was because of the terrible economic upheaval that we start with that we saw in the 1920s that s what we re going through today uh in the world today and i think that we have is incumbent upon us to make sure that the world does not go in the direction that it went after the 1920s uh does not go into the direction of heading to a world war it s not going to the direction of terrible people where people are saying no let s give all the the the means of production over to the government because that s a great idea the government s never messed anything up i i would love for them to run my health care give them the empathy of the irs and the efficiency of the dmv it d be fantastic gosh if anybody here has been to the dmv recently i just want to pray for you it s it s so much worse after after 2020 uh but i ll tell you the number one way that i think we all can save this country because i believe that we all genuinely love this country is by embracing the america first doctrine by embracing you know the mag of doctrine that donald trump started when people say donald trump is the leader of the republican party i i say i think he started a revolution in this country where now we are the leaders of the conservative movement we are the leaders who are going to determine what happens in this country and i believe that our number one priority should be to really truly understand what does it mean to believe in in america first and just shout out some answers what does it mean to be america first and yeah yeah yeah incredible answers like buy american the constitution all these incredible things stand up for the flag absolutely i love that one i mean it s hard for me to stand i understand that but um but really and you know i m going to use a word that is kind of scary and yesterday i was i was trying to figure out a synonym for it but i got to talk to dennis prager and i was like hey what word could i use aside from this and then dennis said well why madison why would you not use that word he needed a cigar and have a fireside chat and and i because i wanted to say well you know being america first means that you re a nationalist that you believe in this country and just like anything else nationalism can be mistrued nationalism can become dangerous and deadly but i believe that it is incumbent upon all of us to save this nation i and now i ll tell you i i i m a devout christian i ve got a great relationship with my lord and savior and so of course i love being able to help people i love taking care of people i i think we should send missionaries out into the world we should bring people to christ i think the most important thing for us to do is to save souls to jesus really the savior of jesus christ but that s our job as christians and i believe that we are a christian nation you know almost every single one of the signers uh they were regular church attending christians who anybody wants to tell you they re atheists or dies they re idiots don t listen to them i think john level had an incredible quote when he said when you hear some horse manure just instantly can he he s much more pious man than i am i would use a different word uh but when you hear that just call it out instantly so when people say we re not a christian nation that we were founded by racist by evil men that s wrong the people who founded this nation should be revered and they should talk to the next generation as the heroes of the 18th century but i i ll tell you i believe that before we as a christian nation start going out and paying for for gender studies in egypt and giving all this foreign aid why don t we start by serving the homeless veterans on the side of the street instead of being the police force of the world some people who want to say oh my goodness well you know what there s this terrible border crisis going on in ukraine and russia vladimir putin blah blah i don t care i i really don t and i love eastern europe i m sure it s a great place but until we get our own southern border secured i don t give a damn about the border conflict in ukraine and so today i m here to make the case for being an america first patriot and when i say make the case for it i i believe that it is our duty and most of us in this room are are pretty young we re all within the same generation i see a lot of there s a lot of generations represented in this room and when i look at this room i have to tell you how honored i am to be alive when we all are alive today because i used to pray all the time uh you know i would say god you know why did you not let me be alive you know in the 1940s to fight against you know the in world war ii or to be a alive during a revolution i want to i want to be a warrior for you i want to save my country i want to do all these great things but you had me born in 1995 at the height of those peaceful and prosperous time the world has ever known you know give me an opportunity well guys i gotta say i m sorry for praying that prayer um i think god has answered in a big way and he said well you know what here s tyranny uh here are people trying to censor your speech your people trying to control every bit of your lives you re people trying to say well you have to have this forced medical operation to be able to operate in normal society what my friends you know i went to new york city it was awful but i went to new york city this past week and i was i was filming a fox hit and when i was there we went out to dinner and they were like oh we re gonna need to see your vaccine card and i said absolutely not even if i had a vaccine card i would refuse to eat here because the only way the only way that we are going to be able to get out of the situation that we are facing in this country where the tyranny is starting to come down upon us is if we start exercising a little civil disobedience if we as americans who say hey you know what i love this country more than i love my government and so if you want to give these if you want to give these unconstitutional orders i will reject them and i will go about my life because i i m just i ll shoot you the finger i really will now i know there s probably some christians in here are saying but what about in in romans where it says that you need to you know be submissive under on unto the the governments that i place in authority over you well i i understand that but does anybody know what the preamble to the constitution says what are the first three words we the people so in our founding documents it says that we are the authority it says that people like me a congressman i serve you and so when the government is not when the government is not working on your behalf it is your duty to disregard their orders it is your duty to be civilly disobedient i believe that s what we re all called to do and so i know i went into some some policy ideas of things that we can do and i have to say how sick and tired i am of having to say i m a republican and i am a republican but first and foremost i m an american and when i say that it s because all of us in this room you know we can blame antifa we can blame black lives matter we can blame joy mayor we can we can blame all these terrible people for the problems we re facing in our country but i believe the true problem that we re facing in our country is for the last six decades we have had a republican party who has sat down and allowed the radical left to run a rough shot over every single one of us we ve had this party who s just said you know what let s let s go there let s debate about tax policy and incremental gdp growth at the end of the year let s let s do all of that and when i hear all of these things it s as if these people believe that we re an economy that happens to be inside of a country no we are a country that has an economy inside of it the economy serves us and the way to make sure we have a strong economy is to make sure we have a strong society and i i believe as people who believe the america first message we are here to make sure we have the strongest america the world can ever have and the way to ensure that is to embrace judeo christian values number one but two it is to reinforce the importance of the family unit that is our number one priority any policy any policy that you hear that is trying to tell you that we re going to have government intervention into the ability for a father and a mother to raise their child should be highly scrutinized and fiercely fought against the guy none of you who are parents in this room signed up to co parent with the government and you know i i know i started out with with some policy ideas but and people will call me a radical for believing that you know you should be a christian you should get married young you should have as many kids as possible you should try and have a great job you should be as successful as you possibly can they ll say i m an extremist for that and i just look at them and i said how can you believe that i genuinely just care about dining room politics i care about that young family who s sitting around the dinner table and what are they thinking about when they re seeing their young children eat they re thinking about am i going to be able to send them to a good school one i think you should homeschool i was homeschooled all the way through i am proudly a college dropout if you are not becoming an engineer or a doctor or a lawyer i highly encourage you to drop out it s a scam um but i believe that we should care about those dining room politics that unites all of us across the board because you know if you sit down with somebody on the other side they just they kind of lean left because the culture around them is indoctrinated in it they ve been indoctrinated to it since they ve been in the government schools well if you sit there and have a conversation with them for over 10 minutes you get past all these these pre programmed indoctrinated and brainwashed pre programmed responses they have and then they actually have to sit there and talk to you using original thoughts and using common sense and common sense is contrary to everything that they believe because they ve had to spend billions of dollars to be able to try and manipulate them and so when we talk about these dining room politics these america first agenda items it s very simple stuff it s hey i want to have very very strong law enforcement i want to have the ability to be able to defend myself if you break into my home you try to hurt my family i will kill you i i believe that we should have a strong economy and the way that we do that is by encouraging people to be able to go out and take risks it s by saying hey instead of taking out that one hundred 100 000 business loan as an 18 year old or 100 000 student loan which is worthless as an 18 year old why don t you why does the government not allow us to be able to take out a 10 000 business loan at 18 to be able to go and create an economy create work create all these great things and another thing i think we should start waging into is this idea of of culture and for a long time the republican party and people that have come before us and i m not here to blame other generations i was born in this day and age and we will save this country regardless what has happened before it but for so long people have said hey don t talk about religion and politics let s not get involved in that because you might offend somebody well good i will offend you because i believe those are the most important things we can talk about if you want a bolshevik revolution in my country if you want to introduce a socialist ideology i had some members of the squad one time telling me hey you know what and i know it s it s sad pray for me i go to work every day with nancy pelosi and aoc it s awful but i had one of them one time tell me hey you know what the person i am on media and on social media you know that s just work i can be amicable outside of work and i almost was i was in the elevator with the person i almost said oh hey yeah no i understand so let s um that that that s cool yeah maybe we can grab a drink one day but then i stopped myself and i said you know what i have no desire to be friends with you outside of this environment because you are trying to indoctrinate my generation to believe that the most lethal ideology in history that killed 100 million people in the 20th century is good and moral and just you are trying to steal my generation s ability to write their own destiny away from them so no i have no desire to be your friend and in fact i will defeat you in every single aspect of this world and now again the the the more typical republican probably would have said well oh yeah no that s great let s go out and get a drink and let s all be a part of this uniparty and let s vote against our constituents absolutely not the remember like i said we the people is the preamble to the constitution preamble to what we believe you all are in charge i serve you and so if i have a socialist who s trying to destroy your lives i don t care about being friends with them outside of the country when you have one of your radical family members who s gone to brownell or some ridiculous university and been indoctrinated and come home and said well mother i m now actually non binary and sir if you could refer to me as he as as a woman she says that if somebody wants to change their name and i i i have a lot of empathy for this if a guy wants to change his name to some feminine name my name is madison so again i haven t believed this and he wants to be called ashley i ve got no problem with that that s cool that s your decision but if you want me to sit here and call a man a woman you are asking me to buy into this lie and i ll say no to that i will say no to that in every single way and now don t get me wrong i will defend i i don t care if you re if you re trans if you re gay if you re muslim if you re black if you re white i will defend your constitutional rights as hard as i can at all times no matter what but i believe again i believe that we as conservatives need to start waging into this cultural war because when you want to take your ideology and now force it onto our children well we are going to fight against that and it is our duty to do so when you want to say that mothers who go and speak at a school board meeting are are domestic terrorists well my friends when i take power back i will be holding you accountable to that the things that you want to hold us accountable for i will start launching investigations into you and we ll start figuring out who the real domestic terrorists are because remember my friends it the things that unite us as americans are very simple because one and we all have a pretty strong libertarian streak that runs through us i genuinely believe that and i think libertarianism is great i would be a full on libertarian if i lived in 1806 and people believed uh in in the ten commandments as as much as they did back then but unfortunately we don t live in that world now and so i i believe that cultural conservatism is the only way that we re gonna be able to save our country i believe that encouraging strong family values regardless of the backlash you re gonna fake regardless of the arrows that you re gonna take in the back is the only way that we save this country i believe that encouraging people to instead of encouraging churches just we ll get as many baptisms as you can get as many offering places you can as many donations as you can you know let s encourage the church to stand up and get off the sideline and start working on discipleship rather than just rather than just baptism because if you go back and you look through the 1750s and the 1760s to look back at what the pastors back in those days were actually talking about it s as if they ve just read the newspaper the week before and said huh i wonder what the bible says about that i m gonna go preach on that but now we have all these woke christian pastors who are coming out and wanting to say oh well let s fly the black lives matter flag out there let s let s do all these things it s disgusting christians are you re not here to protect your tax exempt status as a pastor you are here to be salt and light in this earth you should demand that of your pastors and guys you know i m looking at this clock and to the people backstage i m sorry i m probably going to go to a minute over i i i the times run away from me i had a lot more points that i wanted to make but i i just want us all to lean in for a second to really hear the last bit of words that i m going to say is that i m sure you all have heard charlie kirk say this many times that in our country um you know if we just if we believe that we re going to radically change our country and get back to our founding values and it s not going to cost us anything then we are fooling ourselves my friends i i believe that we as the patriotic americans who were born for such a time as this as esther s uncle told her in the time to to influence the secular government of our time god put us here because he knew that we could handle it and if we could handle it while being able to lean on him and i will tell you we re going to face some dark times as a nation i genuinely believe that i think we have an opportunity the next four to six years to prevent kinetic american forces countrymen on countrymen from ever meeting and i think that is incumbent upon all of us although i have no doubt that we d be victorious better happen but remember that would be that would be so immoral and wrong if we just said hey you know what let s just let s just kick off a civil war and then we ll we ll just go ahead and go to that point no my friends we were called to be innocent as doves yes but we were also called to be shrewd as snakes and we as conservatives it s time for us to get shrewd it s time for us in genesis it talks about taking dominion of the earth you read that original word i mean it means go out and take control of it take dominate the earth that you re given fill it and my friends the only way we re going to do that is if we stop playing this lackluster milk toast defensive game where we re all just saying hey i don t want to offend anybody i don t want to talk about religion and politics no i m going to lean in i m going to take some punches on the chin i think all of us in this room are too and we are going to stand up for the america that we all know and believe in because when we do that when we stop saying oh yeah i believe in free trade no screw that i believe in dominant american trade when i ask opec for oil although we ll drill it here they re gonna say yes sir we ll give it all right away thank you so much for all that you ve done my friends as americans it s time for us to stop being sheep stand up and be lions let s make these people be the last thing i m going to say because we re about to start playing music last thing i m going to say is that the radical left should be terrified of who we are the radical left should be terrified of what we are going to do and if you want to introduce a globalist agenda in this country well we are going to politically uh psychologically in every form that we can confront you we will defeat the globalists in this nation my friends is up to all of us thank you all so much music applause music nothing protects your wealth like gold and silver when you buy from the right source at republic monetary exchange we do business in person take immediate delivery of your gold and silver and if you need to sell get immediate payment no waiting and no worries that s how we do business risk free don t wait weeks for your gold or money from a broker you ve never seen republic monetary exchange gold and silver immediate delivery that s how we do business camelback just east of 40th street the politicians don t want you to know what they re up to secret slush funds secret emails and pay to play judicial watch is your watchdog in washington dc shining in the light of transparency on our nation s capital the lockdowns will go down as one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country bar none you have money you can survive a lockdown you don t you have to fight everything i stand for is for the betterment of the individual as soon as the government comes in and starts to take freedoms away from us it s very hard to get them back i love the opinion that you could do what is right if i let you say your nonsense let me say my facts this is a cultural fire alarm i believe in the american ethos this is a movement of optimism and one of hope it s always been we it s time for our generation to start to rise up and take back america for freedom applause music thank you thank you everybody i i never get used to that the fire right as you turn around the corner please sit down everybody what a great couple days hasn t it this has been incredible and i got to tell you we do so much at turning point usa on campus high school college chapters uh we re working really hard and as you can see look around you the team went above and beyond at turning point usa to make sure that you you had a special couple days and you know from the country music to the early worship on sunday to all the breakouts to the sponsors it really was a very very special weekend and i am happy to say that all of you can now say that you were part of the largest multi day conservative event in american history it s amazing so i want to talk about a couple of things as we kind of close this conference and then of course we have the wonderful kaylee mcinney coming up which is i mentioned this briefly in our opening remarks and turning point usa we are a student organization first and foremost and i think we need to kind of zero in on the problems and the issues that are facing our generation and generation z now i m what would be called a transgenerational i get to choose what generation i m part of so i i disavow millennials okay so i get to be generation z um or whatever but whether it s millennial generation z and every parent out here as i talk about this i m not blaming the older generation for these conditions but it s important that we do take a step back and say that young people are there they re entering into a world that is completely and fundamentally different than one that was in the 1980s and 1990s this is the most depressed most suicidal most drug addicted most alcohol addicted least married uh most childless generation in american history and we should take a pause and ask ourselves the question what is causing this and what are we doing to stop it first and foremost on an individual level then on a family level than a community level and then on a national political level and first on the individual level um i think that one of the major issues that we re seeing is that we have a generation that is searching for meaning and searching for purpose and you see that here at this conference the most enthusiastic applause lines and speakers are people are not just saying that the right is good and the left is bad but instead of saying here s what you got to do to get your life in order to find something that s actually going to live longer than you you see one of the major mistakes we ve made in america and we re fixing it here at america fest is that we used to tell young people that you re the problem and you have a lot of work to do and america s wonderful now we say to young people you re wonderful and america s terrible we totally flipped it upside down and one of the main reasons why we have over a hundred thousand young people that have overdosed on opioids in the this this year alone one hundred thousand young people is that students and members of generation z and millennials they look around they say that there is no purpose or meaning or place for me and that s one of the big lies you want to talk about the big lie the big lie is allowing a generation to literally believe that there is no place for them to be able to succeed and flourish in this country and so you look at the statistics it s the most suicidal generation in american history now if i were to ask the audience how many of you know someone personally that committed suicide almost ever raise your hand almost every single hand goes up this should be a fire alarm for our civilization by the way and by the way it s way more important than systemic racism i m well i m way more interested in systemic suicide in our country than systemic racism which doesn t exist by the way which is systemic racism does not exist in america but stomach suicide does and what is causing this well there s a lot of different factors i think technology is playing a huge role in this in fact i think that and i see this all the time and i don t mean to offend anybody but honestly if i do i don t care this is the last day so um and you re not getting a refund so uh sorry which is when i see eight year olds at a at a restaurant and no one s talking to one another and everyone s staring at screens and they give a seven year old an ipad which is basically a digital pacifier i think there s something really wrong with that i think there s something deeply unhealthy with that and so some of you might remember last year in palm beach at the student action summit i gave a list of things that i would like everyone to do and i was pretty kind of intensely um against technology and then you know this year was a wonderful year i got married in may which was awesome and i encourage every young person to get married early it s not a joke when i say that you should reject hookup culture you should save yourself for one human being and get married early i i don t give advice to young women on how to find a man uh i will say to young men uh get your act together and really make self control and self discipline a priority in your life one of the reasons why so many young women are upset with the dating pool i hear this all the time is that they see men that can t control themselves and they and as you can tell the young ladies are very enthusiastic about hearing this and by the way here s a thought crime for you women want to be led women want to be led by strong men and you will men are different than women and women are different than men and both need each other by the way and so when i got married back in may to my wonderful wife i decided to turn my phone off completely for 10 days just turn it off and just focus on each other focus on god and it was one of the most incredible experiences for a variety of reasons and as i look back at this year this that was really a couple days that changed my life where we went on this incredible honeymoon in paradise and we were focusing on one another and focusing on the natural beauty and focusing on god and all these amazing things and we were looking around at these other people that were vacationing and honeymooning by the way and they weren t focusing on each other they were like strangely bringing their friends from 2000 miles away into paradise either like because they re so they re so kind of like unable to deal with the current moment or they re so narcissistic they need to tell everybody that they re on the beach in the caribbean and what was amazing is watching couple after couple and family after family not even with kids there no one was talking to one another instead they were snapchatting and instagraming and going through tick tock meanwhile there s a whole world out there that they were missing and i realized that the introduction of this technology it doesn t it look technology can be a positive but i think that s a bad argument you know a lot of people say you know technology only gives you more of what you already have and less of what you don t have i don t think that s true i think these phones are changing who we actually are as human beings i think that it s actually remaking what we get angry about what we get happy about and what we what we value and so after the honeymoon i uh did a lot of thinking and i wrote a whole piece about this and i i asked and i ve always been super jealous of practicing jews that were that practiced the sabbath and then i asked myself well why didn t why don t we do that as christians more right and i i really did a lot of thinking in in july i said okay friday night i m going to start doing the sabbath turn off my phone no technology at first it was really hard i got to be honest you re really anxious like am i missing something and in august september october november every friday night for 25 hours and yes 25 that s right you add an hour on uh for an extra hour of prayer meditation um i started this year just completely turning my phone off off the grid right giving one day to god and i have to tell you right now um it was this amazing revelation of something i would always be saying in front of audiences but then i realized how true it was which is that god gave us the law to bless us you see in the decalogue the ten commandments uh a great example is that one of the only ten commandments ted commandment that actually uh comes with a promise is on your mother and father so you might live long in the land of which you are in good advice for every student out there honor your parents it s very important every totalitarian country tries to break the bond between parents and children they do this time and time again this is why queer theory transgender theory critical race theory locism diversity inclusion they re trying to break the bond between a parent and child but also it says very clearly that we must dedicate one day to god and in mark two or mark three it says that um this that we were not made for the sabbath the sabbath was made for man is that this is a gift for us and you look in this hyper technological world where everything is moving so fast and you re you re you might be in this room right now or watching online you might be super anxious and someone might be trying to push medication on you that you don t need by the way and someone might be trying to tell you that like oh all you have to do is do weed bad idea by the way don t do that and like oh yeah just take a hit of weed or all you have to do is drink before you go to bed and like you know that these substances probably aren t going to give you what you re looking for when have you tried dedicating one day out of the week to the lord and turning off that stupid smartphone have you tried that because i could tell you it was a massive blessing to me in 2021 is that all of a sudden it re centers your whole week you journal you read books i know it s a radical thing um and like you could you could do it to varying degrees some people don t get in cars uh i i m i drive around sometimes on the sabbath sometimes i was traveling so i had to give a speech and just was it kind of wasn t able to cancel the point is that throughout the day you re not constantly checking for emails and messages instead you re like oh i m without kind of this this coping mechanism i carry around with me otherwise known as a smartphone and so this year as i look back at it i don t know if we d be able to have an event like this or the success we had if i personally wouldn t have realized that the lord commands us to take one day to rest in the midst of all the craziness and look some of you might be busier than me you might be um if you make if you traveled more than 330 days this year and did more than 600 podcasts and met you know have over 200 people on staff 200 full time people on staff and have to raise a lot of money maybe you re better than me maybe i m not saying the busiest person i m not the point is that if i m able to do the sabbath i really encourage you guys to do this in fact i think that if just all regular americans turned off tik tok facebook instagram youtube and apple all of a sudden i think it would make america an infinitely better place to live i truly do so a couple other things i want to share with you and by the way if i think that could help solve some of the issues of suicide alcoholism drug addiction just that alone and because i think it actually helps lead other things okay um my other advice to students and young people and again super contrarian um but it s true is that you want first you have to know what you want it s a really important thing i know that sounds so obvious but so many young people don t even know what they want which is why they re so miserable right is that they don t even know what is good or what is um what is tragic or what is wonderful and so you should want to be good at saying no and not everyone s good at this by the way you you should want you should desire to be able to say no to your flesh and to temptation and to things that sound good and feel good in the moment here s a little secret for you the highest productive most productive people that you saw speak on the stage the people that you might look up to like tucker carlson they have made life choices that are permanent that say no to things that might make them feel good immediately for example tucker carlson doesn t drink right not not everyone knows that and so now by the way i m not a if you if you drink i really don t care i m not a moralist in that sense however that to compe to compete at the level tucker carlson s at to go do a nightly news show and to write it unique and all that he admits that alcohol would weigh him down that he wouldn t be able to do what he does and so here s the lie that you re being told you can t have it all you can t you have to prioritize some things you can you re gonna have to let go of things that might make you feel good in the moment to go pursue something that is more meaningful than an instant dopamine kick and here s another good rule for life if it feels good in the moment it s probably not good for you if it feels good immediately it s probably not good for you and again i there there s extremes to that right like working out can feel really good um there s also extremes to that again you can make your own choices you can see what you see fit but i know right now that at least half the room this is resonating at some fundamental level because if you re like man i got to get my life together going to 2022 i m not performing at the highest level i can well then you should desire to be able to say no okay the other thing for all the young people out there um you know my you know my thoughts on college we run a college organization i think it s a scam um i think most people shouldn t go to college you know that i speak openly about it and um i think parents sending your kids to college is playing russian roulette with your kids values right um and the wisest most incredibly incredible people i think the ones that don t go to college now of course i lose my audience because you re like okay i m in college that doesn t do any good charlie okay so i get it and i m just i m talking to high schoolers as well and by the way less than five percent of people that go to college probably need to go to college um the 95 it doesn t really do much for you it doesn t instead here s the charge that you should have two things you should try to become a better person that s the most important thing number two thing we need more young people to start new things we need more young people to start new churches to start new businesses to start new families you see college doesn t teach you any of this i always laugh when people say i m studying entrepreneurship like you don t study entrepreneurship you do entrepreneurship okay like it s like i m studying how to you know do we need so what my challenge to you is for there s some young person out there you have a business idea go do it when you are 18 19 and 20 years old guess what here s a little secret you could always go back to college always they ll allow you as long as the check clears it s true it s not some rule that you have to go when you re 18 and by the way it s mostly stuff that you re either gonna regret or forget that s mainly what college is okay regretting and forgetting but guess what if you re 18 you say well charlie what do i do instead super easy find something you re good at that s something you have a passion for two totally different things i have a passion for college football very mediocre unless if you watch the relief factor ad then i m actually really good so um and but a skill i have is not that find your skill not your passion but again hopefully it s not a skill that you like totally hate hopefully you like it and then here s the thing it s so simple go find someone who s really good and has perfected what your skill is and go ask them for a job or an unpaid internship that s that simple you don t need to go to college to do that you need to be willing to succeed it s that simple and guess what you want you want to stand out if you re if you re a 16 year old and you really want to stand up by the way parents your i could just feel the anxiety the sweat the denunciation the preparedness to say charlie was wrong in the ride over i i hear the conversation and that s you know what i embrace it fully because if someone needs to say the stuff out loud because it s true which is if you re 16 17 or 18 and you have that skill and you go find someone who s good at that all of a sudden you want to stand out if you want to be the person that people remember it s not going to harvard stanford princeton or yale or any of that nonsense you want to stand out be the kid that asked for an internship that was scrappy enough hungry enough and humble enough to go sweet floors to learn the actual thing you need to do that ll make you stand out if you want to go find a job and you want to climb up in what you want to do in the future okay learn something new every single day something that excites me about all of you and i just want to thank you guys are like the best audience the those who that support turning point usa those that support our podcast thank you thank you thank you you guys are so unbelievable especially those that listen to our podcast and support it i m so touched by that and something that really motivates me and encourages me is all of your desire to learn and this is a great sign by the way if you want to be optimistic about something it s that every single one of you you have a special focus and intensity lately to want to dive deeper into our history into our ideas and to where we came from guess what that s a sign of a winning coalition so here s my challenge to you especially young people people of all ages is take a journal and say i learned this about my country today i learned this about philosophy today a people that are learning constantly you ll be able to find the answers in the clarity necessary to act and to be able to hold these tyrants and these authoritarians and these despicable narcissists accountable learn something new every single day and so say well charlie how do i do that okay i ll make it really easy for you we partnered with hillsdale college they re amazing guys go to charlie for hillsdale com uh we have some hillsdale students here i think we do um it s and you guys can take their online course it s super easy listen to my podcast you can listen to tucker whatever it is make learning as important as bodybuilders make weightlifting so i want you to think about that is that if you re not using your mind every single by the way the mind is a beautiful gift from the lord and most people just kind of go through the motions they don t really think deeply about what s going on around them there s so much wonder and wisdom that will make your life so much more fulfilling you want to know why this generation is so suicidal we ve told them that there s no truth worth pursuing we ve told them that there s no absolute truths we told them that oh you re just a bunch of cells a bunch of chemicals just do things that make you feel good when in reality we know there s a transcendent order where there s a creator that loves us and that we re made in his image and that you want to know the beginning of philosophy it starts with wonder like wow there s so much in this world that i really don t understand and wisdom is the knowledge of things that do not change wisdom is the knowledge of how human beings act and also things that are just as true as they were 200 years ago 500 years ago a thousand years ago practical knowledge is important wisdom or eternal knowledge is the most important thing finally i want to just say that um one of my favorite bible verses that i don t think gets quoted enough is philippians 4 6 through 8 which is do not be anxious but instead um through prayer thanksgiving and supplication make your requests known to god uh for the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard and protect will guard and protect your heart and mind in all circumstances and whatever s good whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is beautiful whatever is kind i get those words mixed up sometimes ponder and think on those things for through christ jesus he will set you free one of my favorite verses and basically the whole idea is this and i know there s this is a huge problem a mental health problem in our country is very significant everybody and it shouldn t be made fun of but we must understand that the lord gave us tools and abilities especially for young people out there for you to break free and to break through of maybe getting trapped in your own head maybe getting trapped in your own thoughts maybe the constant negativity that s around you here s the amazing message of positivity and optimism i have for you is that through jesus christ through the teaching of the scriptures through things that are totally true and wise and eternally true that every single person here can break through of any of that cycle of negativity you re in right now and that tomorrow can be a much better day than today was and today should be a better day than yesterday and you can actually commit yourself to that sort of improvement because guess what we have free will we have agency and we have the ability to continue to improve and guess and you put all that together that s what makes america so incredibly special is that in this country you are able to use the liberty that the lord gives you because liberty is not man s idea it s god s idea to be able to pursue virtue and things that are always true so i just want to encourage this generation you guys get insulted way too much by let s just say boomers okay this generation there s gonna be something very special that happens out of this generation this generation is starting to wake up they see the cost of the lockdowns the masks and the vaccine mandates they re starting to ask questions and this generation is going to be one that is going to turn get it the trajectory of the nation towards one that is filled of liberty and freedom and virtue and eternal things and that s really what we at turning point usa fight for every single day god bless you guys thank you so much music applause music so music i never lied i source my information but that will never stop the press from calling you a liar we must be on offense confident bold and willing to call it out we cannot be silent kim sake promised us a daily white house press briefing there isn t one today there wasn t one monday when the going gets tough the daily press briefing that she promised goes out the window you don t have to press core you don t have the shouted questions because they simply do not care where are the investigative journalists we are fighting for the rights of all americans freedom is at risk ronald reagan said invest freedom is one generation away from extinction uh and that is why we bring children into this world carry on the message of the united states of america of your family and of your faith whatever that may be carry on the values that we hold dear applause music wow applause music applause music applause music wow music thank you sorry i was not awkwardly holding up my phone i was doing an instagram live so you all were on there thank you so much guys for being here it s an honor to close out america fest have you all had fun i love it well as you all know you may have watched i spent a lot of time taking questions from the white house podium but i have a question today an important question what is going on at 1600 pennsylvania avenue what is going on i mean just last week i watched our president joe biden refer to president kamala harris okay so then i i flip over to see what the vice president s up to and literally she s doing this interview with charlemagne did any of you see it this is a direct quote no no no no no and don t start talking like a republican and it s joe biden and it s joe biden and it s joe biden and i m vice president and my name is kamala harris what is wrong with this lady what is wrong i mean i don t know what s worse who s out of it more joe biden or kamala it s really a toss up which is mildly concerning because they re running our country but there s that a lot has changed i mean i think president trump is a vast change from joe biden we re seeing the disaster of the joe biden presidency but not only has the president changed the leader of the free world the questions coming from the white house reporters have changed have you guys noticed that or maybe you re not watching the briefings i don t know they are a bit difficult to watch i limit the time that i watch them but when i do watch them i m just absolutely stunned by what i hear from the press corps the first briefing that jensaki gave one of the questions asked from the press corps was this could you give us some color about what it was like for joe biden going into the oval office he s been waiting for this for so long what was his reaction wow i would have loved that question never got it then there was this will joe biden keep donald trump s air force one color scheme hard hitting question and there is this can you clarify for us what happened with the president s dog there are some reports that one of them was involved in a biting accident to which jim sake replied there was one bite we later learned many months down the road there were multiple bites i m not sure why you would mislead on something as innocuous as a dog bite but indeed that s the lay of the land there at the white house and then my favorite question was this any update on the white house cat whoa now compare rewind when i was at the podium here s some of these stellar questions that were asked of me let me ask if i can kaylee why does the president keep hiring people who are dumb as a rock overrated way over their heads wacko and incompetent was a question then there was so you ve used the phrase warriors to describe everyday americans fighting the pandemic the president s using that phrase as well what s the thinking behind using that description and is he bet are is he basically asking americans to put themselves in harm s way harm s way like warriors do no i think he s just praising the american people for fighting through covet 19 but there you go and then there was the question you can literally go back and watch i m like flipping through the pages of my binder finding my tab and then i pause and i look up like this in total bewilderment because this is the question i was asked does president trump believe that it was a good thing that the south lost the civil war really they say there s no such thing as a dumb question but make no mistake that is a very dumb question applause but i ll tell you the answers coming from the podium have changed as well there s a lot of deception we were told that republicans want to defund the police republicans they literally said that and for that one the so called fact checkers woke up and gave the administration three pinocchios that s rare for a liberal president but they did that we were told biden never called the travel restrictions on china xenophobic he did you can go find the tweet we re told there s no crisis on the southern border no tens of thousands of illegal immigrants sitting under a bridge in del rio and human excrement and squalid conditions that s not a crisis the white house tells us that that s not a crisis i m not sure what the definition of crisis is because that s pretty squarely a crisis we were told there s not a crime problem it s just a gun problem we were told that that build back better which thank goodness joe manchin joe manson he deserves the clap joe manchin put an end to we re told it would cost zero dollars the white house is still saying that lie then there s the lie that trump never did anything constructive in the middle east we were told that okay wait one two three middle east peace deals more than any president before him i think he did something constructive in the middle east but nevertheless that is what we are told but let me back up about how i got to the podium because i think it s an instructive story for anyone who wants to pursue a career in politics media or whatever you want to pursue my opportunity at the podium really came out of nowhere i was riding in the car with my daughter baby blake in the back and my mom s driving and i get this call my phone it was an odd set of numbers and i knew it to be the white house switchboard and i knew the president not well i would say we had spoken a handful of times i had seen him on the campaign trail because i was his campaign press secretary but i get this call like trying to keep my daughter quiet pink pacifier in the mouth like stay quiet it s the president of the united states calling and he called and out of the blue he said can i ask you a question and i said sure and he said would you be interested in being my white house press secretary which i responded mr president that would be the honor of my lifetime to which and he responded with mark get it done and i think he met mark meadows go get it done but it was it was surreal uh because i had interned in the white house for the bush administration i had watched dana perino give a press briefing she s great love her my calling now at fox you know i had interned at fox i had worked my way up through the political ranks and this idea of standing at a podium where i was just an intern in the back of the room watching the press secretary at the podium it was something to take in but that s where hard work can get you i believe in this room we have a future white house press secretary maybe even a future president i m so impressed with all of you but i ll tell you i had a lot of apprehension after taking the job i wondered if i d be able to do it it was a big task taking to the podium during covid 19 i was riding up with my husband and his truck up the eastern corridor and i was a kind of a nerd in college and in high school and i was on the debate team i loved preparation so you know i m madly reading academic journal articles about how to be a good press secretary i m calling people i m like how do i do this and my dad texted me this salient message that just cut through the noise and of course preparation is important but he said to me kaylee maybe you were made quote for such a time as this applause and those words are from the book of esther esther 414 separately apart from my dad a liberal democratic commentator said to me kaylee maybe you were made for such a time as this and i don t know about all of you but if you re a believer in this room a lot of times when god s trying to send you a message he sends the same message through two different people or you hear it in a sermon and then you immediately open your devotional and you see the same message that s when god s trying to beat you over the head and say hey i want you to have this message and he indeed wanted me to have that message thank you my first day came it was april 13th 2020 and i m going to the white house and it s pouring rain not the ideal way to start a new job i m in the press secretary s office sitting there taking in the moment as i have like water up to my knees on my pants it was like not ideal but you know i m sitting there and i get a call later in the day first day s press secretary kaley come to the oval office and though i had been an intern though i had been a trump supporter for a while i had never been inside the oval office so my first trip into the oval office is to brief the president of the united states and i passed this mahogany grandfather clock that s off to the left when you walk in the oval office and i go on onto the sunbeam pattern rug that president reagan his administration had designed and president trump repurposed it for his oval office and i sit across from the resolute desk that was a desk that was gifted to us from queen victoria in 1880 and i m sitting there on this gold couch thinking i m gonna have to brief the president of the united states and i watch him and i quickly learned he doesn t prep questions like where i d be in my office and my team would come in and ask me questions and we d think through the question and answer he really put a lot of focus on his introduction and the scripted remarks and he s in a binder much like this one and i m watching him and he s taking a sharpie and he s crossing through things he tore parts he didn t like one time i think i even saw him take scissors and just chop a part off so instead of his staff editing his remarks that s how he did things and i realized we re not going to have a lot of time for questions so as he s about to walk out i go mr president i know what you re going to be asked today and he said what s that and i go well dr falchi always causing a problem in the white house dr falchi went out on cnn and said look maybe if mitigation would have started sooner than you know perhaps uh we could have saved more lives to which the press was spinning and contorting and saying dr fauci said trump could have saved more lives so i told the president that he said well what would you say now i had been a religious watcher of the white house chrono virus task force briefings and my parents would come in and i would say i d pause it and say when you all stop talking i will resume i have to take my notes and so i ve had watched these three things i had all the facts in my head and i said mr president here s what i d say i would say on january 6 there was not a single confirmed case of coven 19 and you issued a travel notice for wuhan on january 11 still zero cases cdc issued a level one travel notice january 21st the cdc activated an emergency operations center there was just one coveted case at that time and then on january 31st you implemented the travel ban on china that your opponent joe biden called xenophobic and he said go type that up for me so run back to my office i type it up i type it up and i give it to him and he would never read a scripted answer to a question because unlike the current guy he s the commander in chief he s the one calling the shots he s the one making the decisions the information s in his mind he doesn t need to read a scripted note from a staffer like joe biden does but on that day only time i saw the president do this he read that timeline word for word and i thought good job for the first day in the white house kaylee applause so the president was doing the briefings and i wondered if i d ever be asked to give a briefing it had been 400 days since a press secretary had ever given a briefing and then out of nowhere trump looks at me and says give a briefing kaylee i thought oh wow this is like on a wednesday and then he said it again and again and i thought okay i need to give myself weeks to prepare at least a week i need to get a binder together and finally on like thursday he said do a briefing and do it before monday so wow this is gonna be a quick 24 hour turnaround which by the way i think i know why the president said for me to give a briefing one day uh he said to me i would take very good personal notes just for my personal consumption um and i d write them down and one day he said to me kaylee let me see those notes so i show them the notes these are beautiful notes and anytime he would meet with governor senators you name it he would tell me to hold up my notebook like a proud father so all could see them and i think he said you know if kaylee could take notes and have all this together she can do a briefing so i get ready to do the briefing i get the binder together and i ll tell you that binder that became something uh that was written about by cnn among others that there s actually a camera behind me and they would take pictures of my binder to try to get the tabs and i guess get some intel i don t know why quite they were taking the pictures of my binder from behind me but it led cnn to write this uh decoding the mysteries of kayleigh mcinerney s briefing book now we thought instead of having like covid therapeutics testing we would do like jim acosta john carl caitlin collins as the tabs that would have been really fun and that is a big regret that we did not do that head fake for the reporters applause but oh thank you i love you guys thank you but i ll tell you as we prepared to go to the podium that day we put in all the work all the human preparation uh but i ll tell you the most important thing i did was on the spiritual side i that morning the morning of my first briefing may 1st 2020 i listened to a joyce meyer sermon about faith over fear i prayed i listened to christian music i tweeted out philippians 4 13 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me but i will tell you i got a lot of messages coming in from christians like sarah sanders my predecessor who said to me i read my jesus calling before every before every briefing and she she s great i love her she shared with me the message from exactly two years prior in her jesus calling and it said this you are on the path of my choosing there is no randomness about your life as you give yourself more and more to a life of constant communion with me you will find that you simply have no time to worry but i worried that day i worried a lot i was very nervous so i actually was so nervous that i was crying in my office when i was supposed to be at the podium my assistant came in and was like kayla you can t be crying you need to be at at the white house podium and so she got my parents on speaker phone and we all prayed together and then i went to the west wing private bathroom i got on my knees and i said a prayer and when i walked to that podium when i stood at that podium i had gone from tears to utter and complete serenity i i m telling you i felt like i was meant to be there applause and it wasn t because of me i can tell you that i felt that peace it was because i heard it all the time from people like you that you prayed for the administration and we felt it i certainly felt it i thank you for that but look my press shop i decided my dad said to me come up with a motto for the press shop and i said okay i need to come up with the motto what do i want to be the guiding principle of this press office and i thought about it and i came up with offense only offense only because for a long time i had seen conservatives maligned trashed defamed by the liberal media and i walked in with no illusion as to who i was dealing with tried to get start out on a good foot with the media but they very quickly made it personal you saw some of the attacks and questions they were asked and to be honest it reminds me a lot of what you all go through on your college campuses and i write about that in my book you know my time at harvard law school where i loved it it was a dream of mine to go there it was uh walking walking to the class in those crisp fall mornings it was a real honor they have the socratic method in law school where they grill you on a case and it s really good preparation for taking to a podium one day but i ll tell you this i was so dismayed at the environment at harvard law from some of the students in particular i left academia i think right when it started to get really really bad and i know you guys feel it on your campuses i left right in 2014 well it was actually two years later but 2014 was really a turning point that was the ferguson shooting as some of you may remember and there were a lot of protests on campuses and you know i simply spoke out and said look i love our police they re great hard working men and women before you eyes darren wilson let s wait for the facts to come out that s it that s all i said but they didn t wait they did not wait for the facts to come out because obama s own department of justice obama s department of justice concluded based on this investigation the department has concluded that darren wilson s actions do not constitute prosecutor prosecutable violations but nevertheless i was called vitriolic for standing up for the police um they re literally it got so bad where they put tape in on the wall of the student common area and they said privileged speech goes on this side and non privileged speech goes on this side that s how caustic it got on campus which is why it s so important for us to speak truth and to be bold even though it s hard because the tactics that i experience from the press corps are the same tactics that the left is bringing to your college campus so with grace and with kindness and with compassion but with truth we have to be bold and stand firm in our convictions and that s exactly what i did with the press and since i left i will say there has been a whole lot of vindication for the trump administration which is why i m so glad that we shared our the truth boldly from the podium uh for example and i think i i run through these at any speech i do because i think it s so important to have accountability for the liberal hyenas in the press corps so npr here s what they told us this was a headline that i had to deal with at the podium peaceful protesters tear gas to clear way for trump church photo op you remember that when st john s church burn it s the church across from the white house well we were told that trump tear gassed and public protesters for that photo op and i said no that was not the case i told them but they ran with their headlines like the washington post inside the push to tear gas protesters ahead of the trump photo op washington post also from tiananmen square to lafayette square they literally compared the two cnn s jim acosta oh jim do you notice i always used to say i like your thai gym it was a way to like soften them up before going in for the attack um i wonder if i did that this day when he asked me if the white house the president and his team had to do it all over again would you have gassed and pummeled protesters to clear the park so the president could have a photo op oh wait eight months later the department of interior inspector general department of interior inspector general not a right wing news source found this we determined that the evidence did not support a finding that the u s park police cleared the park on june 1st 2020 so that then president trump could have a photo op okay so those headlines were all lies and we now know that to be the case then there was the russia bounty story this was so deeply personal and disgusting the new york times reported that russia had bounties on the heads of american servicemen and women in afghanistan and president trump did nothing about it that was the reporting i stood at the podium and i said this is not verified there is no consensus on this intelligence and in fact there are dissenting views on this intelligence and i even warned before buying into a narrative from the new york times that falsely state something about the president wait for the facts to come out they didn t wait no listen to this irony the current president joe biden accused trump of dereliction of duty how crazy is that now because there s one person who engaged in dereliction of duty and it was president joe biden when he left those troops in afghanistan and left american citizens in afghanistan applause president trump was accused of treason uh new york this is the sickest part of it all to me the new york times literally went to gold star families so families who lost their son or daughter in war and said to them convince them that their son or daughter might have died because president trump didn t take action how sick is that i mean you think of the pain of a gold star family i can t imagine losing a child and then you re told that it was preventable possibly and it was all lie the entire story was a lie and we know the story was a lie because 10 months later biden s intelligence community biden s intelligence community found this the left wing daily beast u s intelligence walks back claim that russians put bounties on american troops it was a huge election time story that prompted cries of treason but according to a newly disclosed assessment donald trump might have been right to call it a hoax it was all a lie yeah can you go to the covid lab leak i ll never forget president trump saying hey so covet 19 coronavirus may have originated in the lab in wuhan where they re working on coronavirus makes a whole lot of sense right well not to the press usa today said trump says u s investigating whether coronavirus spread after china lab mishap but cites no evidence npr scientists npr actually said this debunk the lab accident theory of pandemic emergence washington post fact checker was the new coronavirus accidentally released from a wuhan lab it s doubtful and there was cnn anthony fauci just crushed donald trump s theory on the origins of the coronavirus oh wait one year later one year later washington post how the wuhan lab leak theory suddenly became credible are you sensing a pattern here all of these lies from the press have been categorically debunked many months later but where are the firings of the press where are the changed headlines where is the accountability it does not exist applause but look at young women leadership summit i had a woman come up to me and a young girl and she said to me it s hard to feel optimistic like that those are all problems those are all you know terrible things but you know what what could should give me optimism for the way forward um and there s great cause for optimism and here s why the media has been exposed if you look at the polling axios in january of this year found that for the first time ever in edelman trust barometer history fewer than half of all americans have trust in traditional media get this this is pretty eye opening 56 of americans agree with the statement that journalists and reporters are purposely trying to mislead people by saying things they know to be false or grossly exaggerated 56 percent that s a big number and out of 46 countries surveyed for trust in press guess where the united states ranks dead last people are waking up they see it and they see it when you look at the polling quinnipiac s a left wing polling organization far left wing polling organization and one of my favorite things to do is keep track of their polls that show the crumbling biden presidency and i have a little notebook and every time the quinnipiac poll comes out i get to cross out the number and it goes a few numbers lower so i just cross them out cross them out and you can literally see joe biden s presidency just going whoosh um and here here s the numbers and it s bad for our country let me be clear about that it s bad for our country we want this country to succeed no matter who is president it s a travesty to watch but it s encouraging to see that the american people are recognizing that he is directly corresponding to the problems that we face so the numbers are in from left wing quinnipiac 50 percent disapprove of biden s covid response 59 disapprove of biden s economy 58 disapprove of biden s foreign policy 65 percent disapprove of biden s handling of afghanistan 67 percent disapprove of biden s handling of the border crisis and overall just 36 percent approve of the biden presidency wow that is enormous but look we need you i was just a young girl with a lot of passion i wrote in my dad s truck listened to the late great rush limbaugh i was a rush baby rush limbaugh and formed my entire political compass and then i grew up in the the pews of my local southern baptist church and that s where i learned something greater than political truth and it is the truth that jesus christ is lord and savior but i took truth and i turned it into action and i am so encouraged that i hear from you all and hear what you re doing on your campuses because you re doing just the same uh because we re at a crossroads never before have we been at a place like this where our police officers are absolutely demonized i remember riding through the streets of dc and seeing acab spray painted all across the city on the veterans affairs sign acab all cops are and i won t say that horrible word but they re under attack uh socialism is quietly creeping through the halls of congress that s exactly what the buildback better plan would have done but it s a scary place anti semitism some of the things i ve heard from democratic congress women anti semitic remarks from the squad and the like it s reprehensible and then there s afghanistan i ve always said this was a turning point for this president for this country and indeed it was the polling bears it out but we used to uh not call the taliban or afghan partners they re not partners they hang innocent people in the streets they are not quote our partners as they ve been described we used to believe and leave no man behind we left a lot of men and women behind in afghanistan a lot and then 13 beautiful service men and women our heroes were put in a situation they should have never been in at kabul airport and they gave their lives and they shouldn t have had to do that but they gave their lives heroically because american troops and soldiers always rise to the occasion and they certainly did and then our nation s greatest symbols are under attack um you know began with the tearing down of monuments but it ended with a church that was burning i ll never forget 10 30 p m st john s church lit a blaze i didn t believe it until i turned on the tv and saw it with my own eyes st john s church a historic beautiful little yellow church across from the white house i passed it each and every day it was built in 1815 it was called the church of the presidents because every president from james madison on down had attended a service at this historic church on top of the church is a one thousand pound bell uh made by paul revere s son well that church was lit a blaze so as i m watching this i m press secretary at the time i thought to myself what s the history behind this church i want to know a little bit more about it and here s what i found and there s irony here because these rioters who burned that church um purportedly were doing so on behalf of equal rights well here s the history of the church 1963 st john s rector was reverend john c harper he was told to shut the doors of the church why he was told that there would be a bloodbath that bloodbath uh that was the prediction ended up being the march on washington the biggest peaceful march on behalf of equal rights the one ending with reverend dr martin luther king and his beautiful i have a dream speech well this reverend at this church refused to close the doors and as the march on washington was happening he said this our family on earth are we throughout its widest span oh help us everywhere to see the brotherhood of man those were the lyrics coming from the church and when harper was asked why didn t you shut the doors of the church he said this this church building is open as it has always been to any who want to worship here the ministry of this parish is extended to any who seek it our fellowship with one another has no limitations whatsoever so the church that stood boldly on behalf of civil rights was the church that was lit ablaze purportedly by rioters seeking equal rights our nation s churches are under attack our american flag is under attack when you have a new york times editorial board member said she was disturbed to see the american flag macy gray called it tattered divisive and incorrect blm utah called it a symbol of hatred the us olympic committee apparently has plans to redesign the flag isn t that nice and then there was an alternate in the olympics who said she dreamed of getting a medal so she could stand on the podium and not put that american flag around her shoulders but so that she could burn it nation s symbols are under attack which is why we need you because look they re trying to silence you they re trying to take your voice but you cannot let them because i ll tell you this the same way my dad who by the way dad if you re listening why don t you come out here we re gonna do an instagram live my dad and my daughter baby blake my mom s here but

another episode of sac town talks today we have a special guest joining us rebecca bauer khan joining us rebecca how s it going thanks for joining us it s good thanks for having me fun to be on today i know thanks thanks for coming on and talking a little bit about yourself and kind of your road here can you kind of give us a little background on yourself and how you ended up in sacramento good question so i went with california native so that part i got going for me but um yeah i never envisioned myself ending up elected official or politician but here i am i am an attorney by training i went to georgetown law and became a litigator which is what i did for many years uh specializing in environmental regulatory work then i went and taught law school um i did that for about eight years and then 2016 came and went and the world changed for me i am i m the granddaughter of refugees my grandparents were holocaust survivors my grandmother was still alive in 2016 when um donald trump was elected and for the first time in my life i saw my grandmother afraid and that was really powerful she had left vienna austria at 18 years old so she very much remembered and knew what had happened to her family and lost family members in the war and had always believed so deeply in this country that had saved her and her family and for the first time she she saw us taking a turn down a really scary path and i think that woke me up to what this country needed and i believed that i had to do my part i started by doing pro bono work it was my bread and butter it s what i had done my for my career i organized the attorneys at sfo after the muslim ban it felt like a very full circle moment for me i had that s how my family had come to this country right as refugees and here i was helping people who were landing in the same circumstances enter our country and it invigorated me and it gave me hope and what i saw that day was that if each of us stepped up and did our part that our country could continue to follow the values that each of us holds and so i decided i had to do more and through that process decided that the best thing to do was to run for the state legislature and do my part as a californian who was going to really hold the line on the issues that i hold near and dear climate change being one of my top priorities knowing that if we deregulated at the federal level it was really going to come down to california to hold the line and protect our future and the future of my children so i ran for office and i won and i ve had the privilege of representing my district for three years wait so you ran in in 2018 right 2016 oh 2018 yeah elected in 2018 sorry 2018 okay yeah and that was you know that c was held by catherine baker previously right that s kind of a swing state so i guess coming out of nowhere in you know in 2016 to 2018 that s a pretty uh major accomplishment um you know how i guess how did you kind of you know get the support of the local kind of party and things like that to kind of become the front runner and kind of win that seat you know i d been a part of the community for a long time i was on a committee of my school board i had um worked with a lot of community members on an effort to do steam labs at all of our local elementary schools i was on the board of my synagogue so i was involved in the community in meaningful ways volunteer for moms demand action um but this wasn t in my sights and then when i decided that this was something i would take on i was really my community that stepped up and um backed me and said they wanted someone who was going to represent their values and really do the work that they wanted done at this moment in time so it was a grassroots effort of people who believed in me and we did it i was kind of our teeth so are are you originally from from you know the the bay area or you know have you trained you know going to law school in georgetown you know on the other side of the country i guess kind of what what brought you back here to the bay yeah so i m originally from the peninsula um born and raised in silicon valley and uh but i went back east for both my undergrad and my law degree but i m a californian so i practiced law for one year in dc and i just found that it wasn t my speed i needed to come home and so i ended up transferring to a law firm in san francisco and practicing out here and i uh i was dating my now husband at the time who was living out here so he may have been part of the reason a small part small part so you know this is you know always was so interesting to me you know going to law school practicing the law and then going to make the law kind of kind of what were your thoughts going in of of of how the legislature worked and you know making laws you know as a professor and as an attorney to now you know being in it and actually doing it kind of what was your sense beforehand and you know now that you re doing it you know what kind of your thoughts on you know how bills are made and laws are made yeah i like the way you phrase that question because often people say you know how did it meet your expectations i didn t know what to expect right i never did in the legislature i never worked in the legislature i had really spent most of my career in the judicial branch right as um as a litigator and here i was going to work in the legislative branch um obviously doing having done a ton of work in the law i understand the law in a deep way but making it is very different um but i actually found one of the most fascinating things was how transferable my skill set was when you think about um you know a trial lawyer and a litigator right most of the time our cases don t go to trial right they settle right so it s a negotiation how do you find a way to get to where everyone feels good about the resolution and that work of making policy is very similar right you have a goal you re out to accomplish this goal but how do you get people with different views to come to the table to sit down with you to figure out a way to meet in the middle and move the policy goal forward so it has actually been more similar than i expected um some days i wish we had a judge who would be the ultimate arbiter we don t have that it is similar right i remember like one of the first bills i started working on and you know there were some amendments that came in and i was like well but that s not constitutional and my response was well it has the votes you know go to the courts later and i was like wow this is a different world it s very different yeah um so kind of you know being an environmental lawyer by trade and kind of you know knowing that aspect kind of how have you used that kind of in you know making laws or you know i guess searching changes and kind of some of the environmental policies here in the state yeah i mean one of the things is that i think we are incredible at in california is setting goals knowing where we want to go to protect climate to be where we are to give our children the future they deserve and i think the background that i have as a regulatory lawyer which is very in the weeds right i mean this is nuanced work i think has brought to bear really detail oriented how do we get to those goals right i mean yes we want all clean vehicles we want a clean energy future but what are the steps we have to take to actually achieve that to get to where california needs to be and so um you know we introduced a bill last year that we ll continue to work on that related to pollinators you know focused on how we keep our food chain clean and healthy and my first year i worked on clean water and farming right i ve done a lot of work in clean water and really focused on how do we transition our small farmers to more sustainable practices both with drought and with making sure our water tables remain clean um i ve gotten involved in the efforts around pfas in our water i have wells in my own district that have had to shut down as a result of too much of that carcinogen and the well so how do we get those clean how do we support our communities in doing that how do we prevent those carcinogens from entering the water table um i supported a bill senator allen moved around um firefighting foam which has that pfloss and we re removing it because we many of the wells in my district were near a firefighting training center was that how we had contaminated um the water and so we don t know the answer to that but we should be doing everything we can to do our best so really using that nuanced um work to make sure that i m moving the ball forward on the things that really matter to have a clean healthy environment yeah so i guess since you came into in the legislature in 2018 maybe you had one kind of normal session but it s been i guess kind of crazy uh ever since then with remote things and build limits so kind of you know you guys were all limited to 12 bills this year kind of what are some of the things that you focused on and worked on and kind of what d you get to the governor s desk this year yeah i mean you know i entered as you mentioned i entered the legislation a different time pre pandemic um with a vision of what this would look like for me and obviously all of our lives changed when kovid took over our lives and that s true of the work we re doing in the legislature we went from a set of priorities to really focused on our communities in a very different way of helping them get through this incredibly trying time and so i ve done some bills to assist with that i did a couple of small business bills really focused on our businesses in california that have suffered from these open close open closed policies we ve had to do to keep our communities safe so one of those is related to um you know mediation for our small businesses so they won t have to bear the brunt of litigation costs if they violate some of our employment laws giving an opportunity for free mediation which is much less costly for small businesses than if you have to go to court um we did a bill on alcohol to go thank you very much policy i know right one of my colleagues from across the aisle said it was his favorite bill of the year um but you know that s been a lifeline for our small restaurants right the ability to get those extra dollars on those to go orders i still have three unvaccinated children so i m still shy to eat indoors in a restaurant but we do take out to support our local businesses and i m happy to do that so really looking at how we can support our businesses and our community their health but also not forgetting what i was elected to do right i was um i came in committed to fighting climate change and we ll continue to do that so we ve moved um several pieces of legislation to prevent wildfires it s the largest source of emissions right now we really have to get a handle on it both for our safety but also for climate change so we moved two bills on that issue again we moved that bill on um pollinators and then women s rights it s a huge issue reproductive rights at this moment in time california has to continue to lead um i m the chair of the select committee on reproductive health so we re really looking at how we can continue to provide access to women to comprehensive reproductive health care including abortions so we had a bill signed into law a couple weeks ago that will protect our patients and our workers at our clinics making sure that we have safe and comprehensive access because that s the biggest threat right now are these um threats that are happening in front of and to our clinic workers and patients and then you know uh what else so much laughter what about a bill you know that has gotten i guess a lot of press recently because it s you know kind of we ll have to educate ourselves on but what about ab988 can you tell us a little bit about that kind of a new mental health crisis hotline you started yeah that s one of my babies it did not make it to the governor s desk we re going to keep working on that in january um but it is very near and dear to my heart one of the things that i um i have a background in some criminal defense work while i was practicing i ran our pro bono program and had the opportunity to work in the criminal justice system so that s been a real priority for me is figuring out how we can provide a more just system and um through the opportunity of getting to know a family in my district who lost their son to um police officer shooting when he was in the middle of mental health crisis i really learned how we were failing those who are in mental health crisis and so 988 was really born out of that and what it will do is it will take those in mental health crisis out of the criminal justice system so you will not call 9 1 1 and get a police response instead you ll call 988 and you ll get a mental health response you ll get a health care response which is exactly what you deserve and it is a big lift so we re going to fund an entire system of mobile crisis response teams and stabilization services for those who are in crisis but it s really critical work because 25 percent of officer involved shootings are those in mental health crisis and all those people need is a health care response so if we take that out of the equation it makes a huge difference in what s happening on our streets so i i guess what was the roadblock you faced was it was it a funding issue or was there something else so the bill um well we did have a big win so we got 20 we got um i think it s 20 million dollars in startup costs uh so we are starting to do the build up of the call centers so that we will go live in july with 988 but we are doing ongoing funding so it has a fee in it that will cover the funding for all of the phone system the stabilization series services and those crisis response teams and we just needed a little bit more time to figure out how we would do this in a state of this size as you imagine our counties are not all the same and they don t they don t all look the same right i mean you have urban counties you re rural counties you ve small counties big counties so how do we create a system that works for every californian when every californian is not similarly situated both by funding it properly and also creating a system that achieves the goal the legislature wants to achieve which is removing law enforcement from these calls when they re not the appropriate responder and ensuring that they get an immediate response when that s what s necessary so we just need more time to work out what that will look like but we re optimistic that it ll happen this year so you know i guess we had record budget surpluses this year and you know a lot of programs were funded what was you know in addition to this program i guess what other sorts of things were you able to i guess get you know for your district or some other priority yeah so one of the other huge victories thing i ve been working on since my first year in the legislature which was only three years ago but it s still through so long time was a piece of open space we ve been trying to protect out in livermore in eastern alameda county uh the diablo range is an incredible range for wildlife corridor and there is a piece of open space right now that is a pinch point in that wildlife corridor where the wildlife can go down the range and um that was going to be turned into an off road vehicle park which would really be disastrous for the wildlife the species that live on the land those that move on the land and also um the historic and native american elements that are there so we ve been working to save it and this year in the budget we were able to get the funds to do that and to save that land in perpetuity and it will turn into a passive recreation a hiking park where nature and um the community can co exist in ways that are really harmonious so that was a huge win i think for open space for my community and for climate so that s big we continue to work um towards more funding for transportation that s really important in the part of the bay area i represent where people have long commutes so we re working on more funding there although we haven t gotten all the way there we ll continue to focus on that we have a train out that we want to connect the central valley into dublin pleasant and bart station called valley link it s really critical in some of what s happening the two two of the top ten longest commutes are right out there in stockton um and so we really want to give those people easier commutes into the jobs in the bay area and take some of that traffic off the road in that valley where we re seeing a lot of um obviously air emissions as a result um so that s something we re working on we were able to um get more parks and uh other great things for the district that we re excited to see um come to fruition in the next year yeah driving that 205 over the ultimate pass you know was bad 10 years ago i can t even imagine what it is now yeah and trucking has increased so much right we re all ordering on amazon so there s more and more trucks on the road which is the route they take and all the the centers are right there on in the valley right yep all shipped over the hill wow increase so you know you just had you know the end of session uh you guys ended early for the first time uh ever which was amazing so kind of what that 12 bill limit is it here to stay what what are you planning for next year have you already you know started looking at you know what what you re looking at next year and kind of some of the things you want to do we are i mean i think you know it s a it s always a process i always want to do more than we have um the bandwidth to do there s so much good to be done in california um and we have constituents who are so supportive of some incredible work so we ll continue to work on 988 we really are committed to getting to the finish line on that bill and changing the way mental health is dealt with in california i think that ll be an ongoing effort um the bill that is before us when that becomes law we have to build the infrastructure under it we have to have a full series of mental health services for those that need it in california i m going to continue to work on juvenile justice issues one of my um really one of my favorite bills this year although i think i say that about all of them to be honest with you is a bill that allowed for an immediate and expedited appeal for juveniles who are being transferred from juvenile court to adult court prior to this there was no um required appeal for those youth and it is the most consequential decision they will face is whether they leave the juvenile system which is really rehabilitative and go into the adult system where they re in with adults and we know that their outcome won t be as good and so we re able to give them an appeal to get a review of that decision and ensure that they re in the right part of our system and i feel really good about that you know it s about 100 youth a year they get transferred and those youth now will take a second look at whether that s the right decision for them in their case so we re going to continue down that path looking at how we can help the juveniles in our system get better rehabilitation i have a bill pending on recidivism and rehabilitation and the money we re spending on it making sure that we are spending those dollars wisely and getting the results that those that are in the system need and that our communities need to stay safe we ll continue down the environmental path we re going to continue to try to do wildfire prevention and work on those bills that ensure that pg e is doing right by californians and keeping us safe holding their feet too i won t say future fire because that s the wrong analogy here but making sure that they re doing um responsible things with our lines they should be able to provide safe reliable energy and they have failed to do that so we re gonna make sure that happens um and yeah just keep working doing the good work we ve been doing you know something you touched on earlier kind of was like the environmental kind of things in greenhouse gases and kind of global warming you know california is trying to do so much um but i guess what i guess what more can we do like what more is there to do uh you know on that subject to kind of get us in an area where you know we start seeing results yeah i mean they say so the two largest things we can do are wild fire prevention prevent the release of all of these you know i mean these trees are all holding all of those emissions and they just go up in flames it s really bad for our environment so i do believe wildfire prevention has to be top of list for us but the second is transportation is the largest source of emissions right we know that and so we have to do more and better and currently you know we have a lot of electric vehicle drivers in our our wealthier communities but it s not accessible to every californian our trucks are not clean right now and we could move to a clean trucking future and we should so how do we really revolutionize transportation to ensure that we are not emitting there um i also think there s a lot we need to do on drought resiliency right i mean we re seeing it right now the reason that we are in the situation we re in is because it was too hot too fast right and we didn t capture enough water so how do we capture more water and again i ll say it i said it already on this podcast but how do we keep our water tables clean how do we put groundwater into the ground and keep it clean so it s accessible to us when we need it so there is a lot of work still to be done i know california s leading the way but trust me we re not done and plastics i didn t mention plastics why is california failing to respond to the cry of our californians and constituents that they want us to regulate plastic so we ve got to do that too you know wildfire has been a topic it feels like for a decade but maybe it s only been five years and we keep increasing funding and doing certain things i guess what aren t we currently doing that we need to do more of well i mean i m biased because this is what my legislation is trying to do but i do think um we do need you know we have a real problem with these pg e cause wildfires and i think we need to be doing more oversight there i ve said it publicly in hearings i don t think the puc is um sufficiently overseeing pg e to ensure that we re doing everything we can to stop our lines from causing wildfires so i introduced legislation two years ago and pushed it again this year that would give our local district attorney s oversight authority over those um wildfire mitigation measures that pg e should be putting into place we need local individuals overseeing this and making sure that we are actually enforcing the laws that are on the books because the laws are there but we don t have the bandwidth to enforce them and so we need more of that um so i think that s really big and then we have to you talk about the spending but we re not seeing the mitigation work we need done right we re not seeing our forests thinned in the way we need and that is why these spires are so out of control and go for so long so we do need to be doing that work and doing it in a meaningful way which then begs the question what do we do with all that material we re thinning out of the forests because that is a real problem and we have to deal with it and that has been a real controversy in the legislature but i have been supportive of using it to create energy because we have it we need to deal with it and burning it can actually be a way to to hold off those emissions and use the energy and to create alternatives to natural gas and fossil fuels interesting and you know earlier you mentioned you had three unvaccinated children at home so i assume that means they re all under 12 i should have said that yes they re all they won t be fascinated when they can be uh kind of how has that experience been i guess the last year you know dealing with uh you know three children at home and uh working the legislature back and forth and distance learning and that and the like you know there was a group of us that were at the forefront of the movement to really push california to reopen schools and all of us had young children who were at home learning with us and we were seeing firsthand what it was doing to them both in you know learning uh pushing their learning back and slowing it down but also the mental health toll it was taking on them and being isolated and you know i see my son is in second grade so he left in the middle of kindergarten and then missed all of first grade and is now in second grade and they do not have the social emotional skills than my other two did when they were in second grade because they missed really critical years of being with other children and engaging with them and learning those skills and so we have a lot of work to do but it was hard like every other working uh parent and working mother it was a lot of juggling for those that were in meetings with me when recess happened all the kids would come in and be in my meetings during recess um but you know we were all making it work and doing our best and serving the constituents my office and i you know served thousands of individuals who needed edd help we supported our small businesses and we did the best we could and my kids were just alongside to see it all happen yeah wow amazing well awesome well hopefully they can stay in school i have never done so much assisted coloring i was like man this is bad this coloring so no the math i have to tell you common for math i was like we need to go back to the classroom because i do not know how to do common format yeah that was no fun either yeah but assembly member garcia became the math tutor the kids at the legislature oh that s good but there s a little insider that did have a math expert there at your fingertips so yeah good resources that s awesome well thank you so much for joining us awesome information and it was good hearing from you and uh hope to check in with you uh later next year to see what you re up to and uh continue uh learning more about what more can be done awesome well

another episode of sac town talks your host here jared blanyon joined by melissa hurtado from the 14th senate district melissa how s it going thanks for joining us it s going well thank you uh for having me for the invitation and it s it s such a pleasure to be here with you today thank you where are you uh recording from today i m recording out of uh sanger california my hometown it s i m inside my bedroom my bedroom office and where d you grow up i grew up here i grew up in sangra i was born in fresno and uh get raised here uh my entire life what is there a popular eatery in sanger yes there is chuck wagon okay you always hear you know these towns down in the valley they always have that sanger is one of those you always hear about but you don t necessarily know so so what what brought you from sanger all the way up to sacramento what made you want to join uh the senate and being elected yes and thank you for the question before i you know begin to answer that i really want to take a moment to um to really honor the the memory of the founder of sac town talks um scotland he is someone that as a college student at cal state sacramento that a lot of us looked up to and kind of always wanted to you know hear from moore and and being a college democrat there we he was an inspiration to all of us and particularly his interest on community colleges and that s something that i also have a big interest in so he was a visionary and you know my condolences to you all at sac town talks but also to his family and friends yes thank you well well put yeah and um yeah to touch on the reason why i decided to come to sacramento really stems from my upbringing um poverty in the central valley uh really after the recession the central valley never really fully recovered and not only did was i hearing it from from loved ones from uh from friends i was also experiencing it and you know as as a daughter of immigrant parents you re told go to you know go to college and you ll do better than we did and so i did that and and your life hasn t been uh better than my parents my my parents were able to accomplish more with no college education with no high school diploma with only a third grade education coming here to america coming here to the central valley uh and and things have completely changed from uh the time that they re that they were able to to accomplish their american dream their california dream it s no longer the same and it gets to a point where you just get angry you re angry enough um where you want to do something about it and that s where i was that s where i was back in 2018 uh you know people usually say that it takes two years to run for uh the state senate seat i was jumping in january uh you know a couple months before the primary with you know a full uh list of candidates already running out for that seattle both on the democratic side and then of course the incumbent so what were you doing just prior to i guess running for election in 2018 i was you re doing organizing with uh on health health access and also uh for the teachers union here locally and uh that s my background i know how to organize union organizer and uh it took a big interest as well in in health care and and organizing around that and it s something that i still continue to champion now in the state senate yeah i think i remember your election was one of those first elections where election night the results looked one way and then we woke up the next day and it was totally different can you kind of bring us back to that point in 2018 in that race and i guess how you felt election night and kind of kind of waking up the next day to you know seeing that you d won soundly against a an incumbent yeah i look i when i got into this race i knew that the that i had a long shot i didn t have any money i i wasn t like i wasn t the incumbent i wasn t all connected uh to to the point where you know i was going to be able to have all these funding your funding available to be you know to run an effective uh and successful campaign for senate but i had the drive i had the motivation and and i worked hard i worked and knocked on doors in every community of this of the senate district i didn t knock on every door uh there s there s way too many but i did knock on a lot of doors in each community um both in the primary in the primary in the general election and uh and the one thing that my consultant kept on telling me was just just look uh just it s all about turnout if you uh are able to we have high turnout you re gonna win and uh don t worry about it and so the other thing that i i also heard from uh was it uh amanda rentery at that time she gave me a call like a few days probably before the election and she said melissa whatever you do just don t give up don t say okay i i know that i lost because you know kings county is probably going to come in and the problem kings county is probably not going to be overwhelmingly in support of you but just you know hold on and just see what the results are and so the night of the election i was walking and knocking on doors up until the last minute doing you know get out the vote efforts and what i saw was just i saw a lot of people turning out and i knew then at 8 pm i knew at 8 pm that that i was going to win this this this race uh and you know also just it was interesting because then you know once the results started kind of coming in it didn t look so good i was behind but that s because of what you know mandaria amanda and tria had said at that time she said kings county will come in first it s not going to look good and that s exactly what happened but i knew in my heart uh that this was a winning situation whether i actually lost or if i want i i knew that i wanted to um move a message forward about the community that i live in and and i felt that i was doing that so i know i had individuals coming up to me at you know 10 30 p m saying oh i m sorry you know you ran a good race and people will uh remember you from uh from this campaign and and you could run in four years and i was at peace um regardless of whatever the actual outcome was and and and sure enough by like midnight i was ahead so it i started receiving calls about one in the morning and people were like oh my god melissa you won and they were in shock and i said well you know let s there s still we still have to make sure that the results fully come in and we waited a couple of days before we actually uh declared victory yeah so i guess you ve been up here now three three years you re going into i guess your first re election i guess how are you are you approaching this re election campaign any differently are you going to kind of go in with the same mentality you did in 2018 same mentality i mean just focused on the senate district that i represent the people that i represent uh working hard day and night to find solutions to the problems that not only the central valley faces but that really california is facing in and uh i think you know being focused i i m trying to do more and conveying the message of you know what it is what the central valley is like because i just think there s there s there s a lot of uh misunderstanding or perceptions about what the valley the central valley is and you know the central valley is connected to every part of this state in many ways we just need to bring that more to light and and realize how interconnected we are as as a state and kind of now that you re back in the district right now at this legislative recess what are some of your consensuals saying what are the some of the big problems they re seeing right now uh in your district well you know they they re very thankful for the work that i m doing in sacramento and um that but particularly the biggest concern is the drought water water is an issue here for us and you know we ve been dealing with it for a very long time but this year has been pretty bad we have land that is being followed we have communities that have been going without water that have had bottled water come in i mean that s that s part of the whole reason why i decided to run for state senate because i i witnessed firsthand communities um going without water i ve witnessed firsthand how um the the impacts of contaminated water in our system this is something that we grew up knowing about and talking about but really didn t become an issue it didn t we didn t really look at it until uh 2019 at least for my knowledge i know that there was a lot of work already being done in terms of you know putting together sb 200 but um it s something that we finally were able to take action on in 2019 so it s it s you know the drought when we talk about water there s there s so many impacts that it s not just the central valley and i tell this to my team all the time and to others this is a food security issue this is a water security issue uh and you know this is an issue of public health and our own health because what we re also seeing is a lot more you know pathogens and and water that are creating you know potentially deadly you know illnesses and individuals so water and the health of our water is so important to mankind no definitely uh you know right right now we re in the last few days of bill s signing kind of here in 2020 you know all members were limited to 12 bills kind of how did you do this year in 2020 and you know do you have anything you know signed by the governor or sitting on his desk right now yeah i mean we have um i kind of lost track here but we we have we had a couple of bills signed already i think there was one that was signed to today sb609 uh which really looks to um looks to the calfresh program and allows a it s it s just it s such a great program but it the calfresh program um if if you qualify you could enter the program so it s it s a workforce program as well and it has wrap pretty much like wrap around services and uh and i believe even as if a year ago um if you re busy if you re an employer you could also get credit uh tax tax incentives to hire someone from within the program so it s a great benefit although all the way around that was signed today and yesterday we have senate bill 393 signed here in fresno with the governor which looks to make sure that there that um your migrant families don t lose access to to child care and and and so that was that was a great event yesterday and of course great bill that will help a lot of uh farm workers and their families and their and their children so we have a couple a couple of bills signed already we re looking i think still waiting on a few others we have the orphaned wells bill that is looking to get additional information of where uh well you know where these uh wells are located and and uh in order to make sure that we have uh that we re plugging them uh if they re not being uh used so we re waiting on on the signature for that one as well you know this year was a kind of a record surplus budget year a lot of money was able to go to a lot of different communities kind of what were some of the things that you advocated for in this year s budget for your district water the big thing i i would say the big success or big win that we had this year was getting funding for the you know for my essentially senate bill 559 which looks to repair the existing water conveyance systems that just need fixing it so you know we talk about water conservation this fixing these canals is water conservation because we re losing water water that is needed for communities for people for people for our own health for uh and and for you know for food and we we had the governor initially had started off with a 200 million dollar down payment and uh and right now it s at a it was a hundred million dollars so we re we re thankful for the governor and putting money into into these projects because we need we need to be able to move uh water around the state of california we need to do it in a way that um that is efficient right you know it s funny you were talking about how you know this water and the central value issues been going back a long long time i remember you know back in 2008 uh 2009 driving through the valley and they had all these signs the farmers are always great at creating these big signs about what they re thinking and there was like the congress created water crisis uh things like that uh you know we still have those exactly they re maybe a little bit faded uh you know and kind of driving up and down you know you can see you know the politics of the valley is is you know on both sides of the aisle here what what are some of the things that you re looking forward to do i guess i guess next session to kind of help i guess bring water further well really it s about building the bridge right uh i i know that there s we have these signs up and down the central valley and and really it s about making sure that sacramento that my colleagues that californians not just uh not just in the central valley but outside of the central valley know the impacts that that water will have or the lack of water will have on all californians and you know i really see this as a national security issue and uh and so i ll continue to be focused in on you know in and around that and it s really under the umbrella of of the human security theme and so human security is a relatively uh new concept but it s one that is focused on on on basically figuring out what our issues are and trying to solve them rather than um that that are grounded on our on local on local realities and so i really want to make sure that the people all across the state of california know how lack of water is is a human it s a human issue but it s also it s a threat to human security uh to our well being to our livelihoods and and uh and one of the one of the things that i always say is that when we talk about climate change i think that we we we talk about it um in many other in many ways but the one way that we that we don t talk about it is how does how can we do better to improv how do we adapt how do we adapt because um obviously there s things that we can do that we need to do to make sure that we that we stop uh the situation from getting worse but what do we do to make sure that along the way we re protecting you know humans uh from from the impacts of climate change and so that s i could you know ask for a select committee uh on human security and i ll be doing a hearing uh this fall on on on my first hearing will be on the water uh and and the impacts that water has on on our human security and so that s that s a lot of the work of you know what i m trying to do and making sure that uh that we continue to focus on water but really bringing about the issues and making sure that we re seeing how they all overlap that it s not just a water more water for ag down in the central valley no this is a food security issue this is a health issue and you ll see some of my legislation uh in next year that will focus in on that and i guess you know are there like a few solutions like big ticket items that you think could help i guess add water security for you know the state and the central valley well i think that we need to be focused we need to first fix and update our outdated infrastructure system or canals uh obviously there s there s subsidence that is happening that is uh allowing water to to escape and creating more of a water shortage um i think that we really need to also uh think about water in the next five to ten years uh and and and the threats to to water security and making sure that uh that that water stays here in the state of california that we continue to have enough water to not for you know for people um and maybe it s a little bit more work on sequa maybe it s a little bit more work on sql exemptions i i should say sql exemptions and or just figuring out how else we can create more clean water for the state of california and this system was created at the time for a population of 19 million where a population you know 40 million there s there s only so much that 40 million people can conserve that s just the bottom line so how are we going to get more water coming into the state of california we got to figure that out and i don t know if that s a storage you know underground storage water system if it s whatever i think it s all hands on deck i still uh haven t figured out exactly what what the solution is but i think that part of having that first hearing on your water security uh is is extremely important and bringing in some of some experts that have expertise on that in that area okay yeah that was going to be my next question is is you know is your select committee going to help you i guess derive a solution or at least kind of reach one i mean that s that s the goal i mean water is complicated right there s there s a famous saying that um that you know i think it goes along the lines of waters waters for fighting and whiskeys for drinking or something along those lines but you know the react and that s it s it is complicated but we really need to start coming together to figure out the solution because all of our lives are going to be are already being impacted and are going to continue to be impacted if we don t work together to come up with a solution and uh there s there s we have a lot of uh talent in the state of california we need to be tapping into every um every bit of talent that we have so that we can come up with an adequate solution that is not only going to help and save my and you know people here in the state of california but it s going to just save mankind for the entire world because this is an issue that water shortages and and and just less water is something that is occurring all around the world not just in the state of california no definitely um you know you you ve been appointed to the latino leadership committee can you kind of tell us a little bit about that appointment and kind of your role in the committee yeah so back in july of 2020 i got an unexpected call from the biden team campaign and i was asked to join the latino committee the national latino committee and i said yeah sure i i ll do whatever to help vice president joe biden and because i ve just been a big fan i ve been a big fan from uh the moment he from the time he was back as vice president uh under obama and so i said yeah sign me up what do i need to do and so sure enough uh i i didn t know exactly what that meant but as you know kind of the days went on i learned that there were about 45 uh individuals across us across the the nation that were part of this latino committee that included uh six of us here in the state of california and and uh i was the only legislator uh representing in the in that national latino committee along with a couple of governors and and uh senators uh and uh across the nation so it was uh it was really just coming together with putting putting together the latino agenda for uh for the biting campaign and really what the what the needs of the latino community are and how we were looking to find solutions to address them and so uh we put together a kind of like a policy propo policy proposal that that included topics on everything from education to health care to jobs and and a lot of that is is what is kind of being implemented to a certain to a certain extent through the white house at the moment no that s cool you guys have you guys met uh recently or any plans to meet in the future uh i mean we state there s there s a few that stay in touch and uh i know that the most recent call i had was with a state senator the former i think at this time a former state senator out of florida i believe uh he s go if i believe he s already been appointed to a position uh but i m not exactly sure if he s been confirmed or not or where right his appointment processes okay so and so i i guess you know now is kind of when when you re coming up with your big ideas obviously you already have some thoughts of what you want to do on water kind of what what s some of the other i guess areas or builds you have planned for for next legislative session well going kind of touching again once on human security i really want to focus on one health that and in one health i m not sure how familiar you are with the topic or if you ve heard of it but one health is also a concept fairly new that focuses on how human health animal health and environmental health are all interconnected and so if we really want to solve or figure out how to get out of this pandemic we really need to figure out the impacts that you know the environment and and uh and and that animals and humans how they re all intertwined and the role that they play so uh we touched on that a little bit this this year through senate bill 453 which was signed i believe last week and that bill essentially what it what it looks to do is to allow you know research on zoonotic research at csu campuses and allocate some funding for it and so it s such a big thing uh personally i think you know i think it s something like sixty percent of emerging uh diseases are come from jump from animal to human right and so we ve all learned as we ve all learned exactly as we all learned and and if we really want to um change that if we really want to address i mean look it s going to become more and more of an issue and it already has been an issue we just haven t really seen how it s all kind of interconnected and tied together and so if we really want to look at the future or prevent the next pandemic we really have to start looking and doing more zoonotic research and so i think that we need to be doing that at all levels of the education system and currently a lot of the research is focused to uc s and so this bill is is great because it just it looks into the diseases that are found in in animals that could spread to humans but really diseases on animals and diseases on crops that they re also a it s also a food security issue because you have a disease that s found on a crop it could essentially take out the entire crop and of course that we don t need that right in this time when our food supply chain is unstable and and so we need to make sure that we we prevent diseases and outbreaks on on on crops on animals because at the end of the day they all have an impact on humans uh and once again i think that s that s how it all ties into human security and and one health is is an area where i plan it to continue to focus on and quite frankly there s there hasn t been a lot of focus in on agriculture and and just the world that agriculture plays in in in our everyday lives and so i m really excited at the work that we ve that we ve done so far and really excited about the work that we ll continue to do in this area yeah i guess we don t really ponder it until we re directly confronted with it and as we have been in the past year and a half uh we ve had to deal with a lot of that right definitely merits i guess for those of us interested in i guess following your select committee can you give us a little more information about when you guys are going to be meeting and who s on the committee yeah so on the committee is as senator ben allen senator ben wesso and senator melendez melendez and and myself and we re looking to have our first hearing uh sometime in november but we re still going through the approval process to make sure that that we that would get a confirmed date so uh just stay tuned to all those listening and because we re looking to have one in in november so i you know it s it s a very interesting and fascinating area but i also encourage if those that are listening in that if they want to hear a little bit more about this this this area of interest of mine i encourage them to go to my website we did a virtual town hall at the beginning of the year and a lot of good information was was you know kind of put out there to talk a little bit more about zoonotic you know research and the role that it placed in in health and the role that it plays on our everyday lives oh definitely definitely check that out well senator hurtado thank you so much for joining us and it was very informative and uh hopefully we can catch up with you sometime next year to kind of see how your select committee is doing and kind of the things you re working on anytime thanks again all

if you add 7 million jobs but no one hears you say it does that help your poll numbers for president biden the answer seems to be no and there may be a couple of reasons for that with such strong job numbers coming out of march what is going on here why can t the byte administration seem to convince people that he s doing a good job on the economy right and so just to put some numbers behind this the us added 431 000 jobs in march and the unemployment rate is down to 3 6 which is compared to 3 5 percent in february 2020 so on on many employment numbers including labor force participation we re getting closer and closer to the pre pandemic levels uh and cnn and moody s have like a back to normal index which puts the economy at 95 percent where it was pre covered so you would on a lot of these metrics right the economy is getting back to where it was but obviously one of the most glaring stats out there is inflation right and i think you ve got this this tension between uh the fact that we re adding jobs and the fact that inflation is going up and they re actually related obviously because uh the lower the unemployment the more workers can demand in wages uh and the more they demand in wages the more prices will go up as well not that that s necessarily the most significant driver of inflation but it can be a driver and what s interesting is that when you ask voters about this voters um by a small margin are more likely to say that we ve lost jobs over the past year than that we ve gained jobs so voters are not seeing uh in their everyday lives this improved economy they actually they re not even perceiving job gains when we re having pretty significant job games over the past year yeah it s roughly only um a quarter of voters who think that we are adding jobs which is correct but at the same time there s the issue of the labor force participation rate where this has already been on a downward trend where less and less people were actually actively seeking work and then during the pandemic it plummeted and it still hasn t really come back to where it s been and i think that that s just translated into a ton of staffing shortages which i wonder if that s what people are conflating because we know that there is inherently an issue with job matching up in uh in our market and so that hasn t translated into unemployment per se but there are huge gaps in our labor force and i think we ve all kind of felt it like whether you re sitting at a restaurant and there s like one waiter there um and there it s led to mcdonald s having a 500 sign on bonus at some locations truckers in portland got a 30 grand sign on bonus um and you know there s a ton of different factors behind that whether it s people who are being dubbed epiphany quitters who during the pandemic decided i m not doing something i want to do there tends to be recently a much bigger amount of people who are kind of just mismatched with jobs that are in the market but as a whole i think we re seeing a shift in our economy about what jobs people are willing to do or want to do and i think there s probably somehow that s connected to people perceiving that as an unemployment issue when really it s just our economy is not reflective of the workers right now there are two different phenomena going on at once one was is the during pandemic version of this which was mainly driven by retirements people staying at home to care for a family member whether it s a child parent grandparent etc but this trend was actually pretty stark before the pandemic and as i looked into this i was pretty surprised to see what was driving this so it was actually the largest group uh driving uh the decrease in labor force participation were actually men aged 25 to 54 so these are people in their peak earning years which i found really surprising and when you ask people uh why they re leaving the workforce the number one reason given was disability or illness i have reason to think that that might also be and some of the data bears this out uh related to some trends in our country like the opioid epidemic but we have to go into that uh there s also more stay at home deads um you have de industrialization uh you have incarceration as a barrier to entry which is obviously been a trend for a long time in our country but i found that surprising that it s men in their prime working years that were driving this number before the pandemic you know some of those men may become stay at home fathers like you said i mean that happened to me for a year after the pandemic i just became a stay at home father and maybe i would have been a part of that uh particular uh rate of uh decrease in labor force participation but also i think the the bigger thing that i want to get to here is the obama administration is just terrible at communicating messages and i think that s something we ve seen this entire time if we if we really rank how good or bad they ve done at certain things it hasn t been the worst administration in the world but it s just the communication they just can t seem to explain to us how good they are doing if i was biting i d be out there every single day saying look at these low unemployments remember when trump said lowest unemployment rate ever like technically there are 10 states right now that literally have lowest unemployment rate ever and we really just haven t heard by talking about it but i guess the big question there is he could yell that all day long it s not going to change a 7 9 inflation rate and so if he improved his communication would that in any way improve the outlook that people have on this situation i think part of it is the nature of the amount of things this administration has dealt with whether it s covid afghanistan ukraine you can go on and on and on i m not making excuse for it i m just saying that they have very little room to stay on message for any significant period of time my guess is as you head into the presidential election year you re going to hear them almost exclusively talking about this and the question is are they going to win the day on that messaging or are republicans going to win the day i i ll read this quote though the republicans seem pretty confident in this this is from michael mcadams who s the the nrcc s communication director so the head of the republican congressional campaign committee s communications and this is what he had to say to politico he said nothing i ve seen in my decade of working in politics has been as sailing as the inflation inflation message with voters when republicans are talking about people encountering rising prices every minute of every day versus democrats talking about bridges that might be built in three years it s like an nfl team going against a pwe football team i think he might be right yeah i think there s no getting around whether he improves his messaging on unemployment there s no getting around the fact that every time anyone pays for literally anything whether it s just a carton of eggs people are feeling the fact that the economy is broken and i think obviously there s a misunderstanding and a blame being placed on the unemployment rates but regardless that still is a reflection on the administration in most people s minds there are some partisan numbers where 16 of republicans are able to accurately identify that we actually have increased the number of jobs versus 36 percent of democrats but in the end i think everyone is just feeling the reality of our economy right now on a very personal level and i don t know if messaging can really get around that yeah and to add to that partisan nature of this there was a pew survey that asked voters at the beginning and the end of the trump administration how they would rate the economy or the beginning or near the end of the trump administration and 18 of republicans rated economic conditions as good or excellent during uh during 2016 81 percent did in january 2020 whereas democrats didn t change their views at all pretty much during that same period of time and so it shows you just how stubborn people are in the face of data right like same economy but you know your political party basically determines how you view that economy music applause music you,"economic,economy,covid,wages,jobs,million

debate a show for political eclectics i m ravi gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlot well corey what do we have today well on today s show we are seeing new fault lines in the republican party we talk about the diverging past between mike pence and the rnc then we check on the freedom convoy that s overtaking the canadian capital we ll take a look at how gofundme is driving fresh controversy around those protests blue states are dropping mass mandates and china is pouring more money into the metaverse but first things first after nearly two weeks joe rogan is still in the headlines and i m honestly sick of talking about this guy the podcaster first received scrutiny from musicians on spotify for spreading covet 19 misinformation on his show but the attention has now shifted to rogan s prior use of racial slurs in a compilation video posted on social media rogan is seen repeatedly using the n word in various podcasts over the years a separate video shows him telling a racist joke comparing black people with the planet of the apes that s messed up now rogan has issued an apology for both of these videos and spotify s ceo is standing by him but the pressure to d platform and cancel rogan continues so where do we come down on these new allegations on everybody s favorite podcaster yeah i i m with you in that i hope this is the last time we re covering this for a while me too but i think where we are right now is you know he s gotten renewed scrutiny over everything he s ever said i mean his shows can be really long some of these shows could be four hours and people are picking through those and you know found some some really rough stuff there s a lot of attention to like his use of the n word and whether it was in or out of context i think we don t really have the full clips for that because they were taken down but there is this clip that you referenced which is the plan of the apes clip we get out and we re giggling oh you see plenty of games we walk into planet of the apes we walked into africa dude we we walked in the door and there was no white people and as he describes this was a terrible clip let s look a little bit at his apology here for this i was trying to make the story entertaining and i said we got out and it was like we were in africa it s like we were in planet of the apes i did not nor would i ever say that black people are apes but it sure __ sounded like that and i immediately afterwards said that s a racist thing to say corey what do you make of that um i mean i mean it s real easy to kind of you know have that hindsight you know uh you know 2020 is high um hindsight is 20 20 with that you know so basically you know when you re looking back on something it s really easy to put it in context but before he made this particular video his full explanation for the planet of the apes comment was i was telling a story in the podcast about how me and my friend tommy and his girlfriend we got really high we re in philadelphia went to see planet apes didn t know where we were going got dropped off by a cab we got dropped off in this all black neighborhood and i was trying to make the story entertaining and i said oh we got out it was like we were in africa it was like we were in planet of the apes so that was his full explanation and i mean out of all of this i think the key point is we got really high like this is the right wing this is their new poster boy like someone who just gets high and says racist things and to be honest you know at first we were all mad because he was spreading misinformation about cov19 like that s what the original beef with him was and then it shifted to this new you know these allegations of being racist and these are not new allegations these videos first circulated back in 2019 when he got the um spotify deal i think before he got the spotify deal so this is not new information so 50 of me is like well we re just shifting the goal post now we re just we re just we re getting mad at him for something else because we couldn t cancel him for the vaccine misinformation for the perceived vaccine information so 50 of me is like well that s not really what we were talking about at first but then the other 50 of me is quite alarmed by how many people on the right has have doubled down their support of rogan after all of this it s almost like there were people who wasn t even talking about him that much that have now jumped in because it s become full blown council culture culture war nonsense and so that i find a little bit alarming but at the same time it just it just it s one of one of those things that you do when you re trying to counsel somebody you go through 20 years of their past and try to bring up everything you can and i don t know if that s 100 fair given where we started this conversation right and when you say we like obviously we didn t call for his cancellation over the covet misinformation and i think right now nobody has the power to cancel joe rogan like even if spotify were to kill this deal with him you know as we talked about in the last podcast or one of the last podcasts the rogan probably could make more money outside of spotify especially if you take into account that if they cancel this contract you probably have a serious penalty so he d probably take some money from spotify go start his own thing and their offer is out there right there are people already offering him the same amount of money to do his podcast elsewhere so the question is what do you do about this so for him he s apologized and it s not for me because he didn t he didn t speak about people like me so it s not for me to be the leading edge of people who accept or don t accept his apology and i m not like a long time listener i listen for the show and i listen every now and then when there s some kind of medical thing on there like you know lifespan or peter a tear or somebody like that but i thought derek thompson in the in the atlantic had an interesting take on this he said at some point people spending our time spelunking for his worst recorded moment need to ask themselves what do you want what is the outcome we re rooting for and then later on he says this is the bottom line arithmetic of fame joe rogan has 11 million listeners and i do not we don t um and you do not correct we don t uh we can t change his audience i just hope we can change his mind that s where i am which is this is a super influential person 11 million and you know as you described like the right seems to be particularly enamored of them but there are also members of the left uh who are gravitating towards that podcast and my sense is given that he s not going away i understand people are like we need to like like take our music off this platform or stop engaging with him etc is i think that he s got way too powerful a platform for anybody you know who s trying to persuade huge swaths of america to just ignore at this point and i think the strategy to try to persuade him and his audience is it makes a little bit of sense to me yeah and i think it s worth noting that um daniel eck the spotify ceo kind of comes down in a very agnostic way on this um in a statement he said i strongly condemn what joe has said and i agree with his decision to remove past episodes from our platform which all the episodes in question rogan decided to remove and he said i want to make one point very clear i do not believe that silencing joe is the answer and it s worth pointing out that rumble offered him 100 million dollars to leave spotify like there s not really a route to totally canceling joe rogan and i think that you know i mean i always come down on the side of redemption it s regardless of who it is or if i agree with them but obviously these clips look really bad and um and i appreciate that despite a lot of people on the right who say never apologize to the mob i believe in not apologizing to the mob when you haven t done something wrong but this is an example of a really bad look this these clips are really really unfortunate they reflect very poorly on him and so i think that this apology hopefully can mark a turn and even his last apology and committing to some more responsible um kind of metrics of bringing different voices in and stuff i i hope that this is kind of a reckoning and whether or not i agree with all of the kind of cancellation attempts on him i think that it is important that he kind of takes this new this new responsibility very seriously absolutely i mean i don t really have a problem with joe rogan i i have a problem with the people who are trying so hard to defend him when he himself is apologizing like you just said ricky there are people on the right saying no you shouldn t apologize for this well i mean it was wrong for him to say these things you got people on the right trying to ignore these comments you got people on the right trying to justify them saying things like well we don t know the context he s a white dude saying the n word i don t really have to know the context to know that that s not right that that s problematic and then you know uh there was there was a eclipse coming out over the weekend of people i think it was uh one of the hosts of breaking points posted a a video of joe biden saying the n word uh when he was quoting someone uh implying well why can t joe biden do this and rogan can t no joe biden shouldn t do it either like like if you go to court you don t want to impeach him over it but you just say it s wrong right well yeah i mean it s like this idea of if you did something wrong you can t just say well somebody else is doing something right wrong and that s the reason why you shouldn t get mad at me for doing something wrong and we seem to do that all the time it s the what about is in olympics absolutely absolutely so uh speaking of breaking points they had a segment the other day about this and this was the description of the segment it says crystal analyzes the rogan smear campaign from the perspective how it represents a deeper rot of american politics and what the end result of something like this could be so basically our reaction to this is a symptom of the rot within american society i m with there on that our country s really __ and these moments i think only underline that but then she goes on to say that uh people are more concerned about rogan s words which have been taken out of context than the real problems facing society now i think some of his words may have been taken out of context but as he describes the the plan of the apes thing was just wrong and he apologized for it and i think people shouldn t be going above and beyond to tell people who are apologizing that their apology is wrong like i don t think rogan is like afraid i think he s just like hey i said something shitty and i m apologizing and it is interesting to me that there are defenders of rogan who want to go further than him and defend him he could defend himself but i think this gets even more interesting when she said and breaking points for people i think a lot of our listeners especially um the youtubers know breaking points is a it s a big alternative media company which launched about a year ago huge audience and they put put together a lot of interesting content and she said they have bigger things to care about and she went on this like segment about like there s all this problems economic inequality and stuff we should be focusing on that kind of stuff there are in one sense about a billion things going on in the world more important than the current efforts to shame smear and censor one single podcaster you ve got hunger poverty war despair climate collapse just take your pick here s my problem breaking points and a lot of this alternative media have no problem doing segment after segment after segment about cnn msnbc and the problems then they literally did a segment a week before about maddow it was 10 minutes of straight gossip about why maddow was you know why is she stepping back she s doing a podcast she s doing a film here s the you know kremlinology of msnbc and here s who s up here s who s down it was mocking msnbc apparently insiders were thinking she might take some time off in the spring well that initial time off has come a lot more quickly than people expected then they extended nicole wallace now they have nobody in the prime time what are they going to do who is going to take over they have nobody now who can compete with tucker i mean rachel basically was the liberal tucker and now it s dead i cannot wait to see this thing crash and burn so my question is why is that okay but when we in and maddow last time i checked his 2 2 million viewers uh rogan according nielsen has 11 million so rogan is a more powerful media platform why is it okay to critique and mock uh msnbc but not rogan who has 11 million people i don t hate rogan but i think he s a powerful guy as is breaking points now in a lot of this alternative media and they don t get to to play by a different set of rules than everybody else like there s this sense that we re the smart serious people we get to critique media but if you re critiquing media it s because of some witch hunt and some bias so i have a real problem with this and i think that in general i think that legacy media is an improvement upon what came before it in many ways like i think like coverage of things like the wuhan virus alternative media sorry uh alternative media like the coverage of wuhan for example like there s a leg the alternative media is gonna push boundaries in a lot of those stories in ways that the traditional media has not the problem is sometimes they throw 10 darts at a board and if one of them hits they re like yeah i m super smart um whereas we re like all right let s go back like when you did that segment about january 6 and it being an inside job like is there follow up to that like you know and you go one after another and so you ll notice these patterns the bigger pattern that i m worried about though is that uh these alternative media figures are friends with each other they go on each other s podcasts so the people from breaking points when they launched they went on rogan they got a lot of their audience from that i m jealous in many ways i could ready to see the commentaries like i would love that audience now um when they go on rogan to me that means that they have a relationship with him just like maddow no statler and you know david axelrod and all those people scratch each other s backs and that s wrong and we should point that out when people in alternative media know each other and have each other s backs we need to call that out too they don t get to play by a special set of rules and when they become bigger than the rest of media it becomes even more incumbent on us to critique each other it doesn t mean that i think they re bad people i love a lot of these shows i listen to rogan like every now and then i listen to breaking points a decent amount i think like they did a segment on quantitative easing last week or the week before that i thought that was really smart but it doesn t mean they re perfect and so for me i think if we replicate in legacy media the smugness the double standards overconfidence of traditional media it will be a huge mistake i would just point out one little wrinkle in that situation though i don t think anyone s a mean from criticism and i would critique any podcast no matter what my my relationship is but i think that there is a difference between calling out cnn or msnbc for hypocrisy and what s happening to rogan right now with trying to de platform him like nobody and maybe there s like some french people who are saying we should take msnbc off the air but i think that that going that next step is what is particularly concerning to me um with the rogan thing but i d also say i do kind of agree with her in the sense that this is a symptom of a kind of societal rot because i don t know anyone in the beginning of the pandemic who said you know who i m going to turn to to tell me what to do about vaccines joe rogan right like this is this is a symptom of a failure of public health messaging a failure of our politicians and our health officials to keep people together and in this together and i think that you know rather than just point the finger at rogan we need to all like all of our institutions need to point the finger at themselves and start thinking like how how did we get to this point this is super weird and i feel like rogan is just sort of like a figurehead of this whole thing but really not what s behind his popularity in a sense he s almost like an accidental uh center of this entire debate but i think like i would agree with you if the only focus of these segments like breaking points was about the people trying to de platform them but what they were saying is like the focus at all on what rogan s saying is like you know she said that people are concerned about his comments uh which have been taken out of concert they re not focused on the real problems in society but like my point is like and she s not saying that specific to trying to de platform it s just the focus it s the attempt to criticize him etc and for me and you ll notice it within breaking points right like they criticize people who they don t have strong relationships with and they they take it really easy on the people that they have strong relationships with that s what the legacy media does like they scratch each other s backs they hang out at the same parties uh and they look out for each other and for me like why is it okay like why is it distracting to focus on things that rogan says we re not trying to do platform we re just saying hey that was shitty and if if he s for instance spreading misinformation which is not necessarily what this segment is about pointing that out is not saying we should do platform we did that the other day uh but then saying like all right like here s like literally every breaking points episode is some clip from cnn or embassy embassy saying oh here s what you know brian stetler says here s what maddow says and let s you know even colbert and let s mock that or in some cases like very validly critique it that s not distracting right but why is it distracting if we do that for rogan that s my question do they do that with like tucker carlson and sean hannity see that i don t know i m not as knowledgeable about that i do know that they might have a relationship with with tucker because i think he did a blurb on the way well it just sounds like they re a part of the societal rot then because they re on one particular side and they re only fixating on critiquing the other side and by the way like joe rogan is a weird person to put in his position for the right because isn t he a bernie sanders supporter like he s not a right winger that s what i m saying that s why i hold out like like to me it s like an evolution right and like once again like like i don t i don t necessarily i m not in rogan s heart so i don t know if he s a good or a bad person i just say like here s a guy with a really important platform and i hope he and like per derrick thompson s point i hope he evolves in the ways i would want him to evolve but i don t get to make that choice right um but i think like people could critique us and say well okay well what s your bias so you know that s why we have a system like every 365 days here at lost debate we re going to put out a report that says here s everybody who s giving us money and small donors can opt out because they like i value their privacy so if you give us 25 bucks which you can do on our website uh then you re not gonna then then you don t have to put your name in that report but you give us like a thousand plus dollars you go on this report and not only will we report who gave us money which i think goes above and beyond what a lot of these platforms do when they do patreon but we re also going to include in kind contributions so if you put me on your show i m going to then put that in the report and for everybody who s given us money or giving us in kind contributions by helping us get to their audience i report any reporting that we have done about those people and we re going to do this every year and say all right you put me on your show right you put me on midas touch or something um have we talked about midas touch did we not talk about myself was there a pitch that we let go by and we ll try to be as thorough as we possibly can and that s the best we could do um and then people will be like all right well you guys are like you know the david s to the goliath so the breaking points so who are you to point them out you re jealous they re audiences like sure you know bill maher is the david to cnn s goliath they have way more viewers than him fox news certainly does that mean he can t critique them no i mean it s even more important for the davis to critique the goliath in these situations i don t know enough about their kind of editorial edge but um yeah i ll let that stand i like the transparency there i love the transparency well moving on to our next story former vice president mike pence is breaking with his old boss to an extent we haven t seen before here s what he had to say at an event for the federal society on friday i heard this week that president trump said i had the right to overturn the election but president trump is wrong i had no right to overturn the election the presidency belongs to the american people and the american people alone and frankly there is no idea more on american than the notion that any one person could choose the american president on the very same day pence made these remarks the republican national committee formally censured two republican members of the house liz cheney and adam kinzinger for serving on the january 6 committee the rnc accused him of persecuting ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse really an awfully sanitized way of describing the attack on the capital so on the one hand you have pence pushing back on trump s 2020 narrative and on the other you have the rnc fully endorsing the big lie what does that tell us about the current state of the gop i think i m having a hard time keeping track of this narrative you know first it was wrong and people were condemning january 6 within the right and then it became an antifa uh plot and then it became a deep state plot but now it s legitimate protest again and uh it s i m just it s maddening the revisionism that goes on here i was glad pence sent what he did uh but i think like if you go beyond this and say you know you take what pence said uh but then you stack it up against what the rnc did in centering kenzinger and cheney last week and saying that it was legitimate protest you take uh you you look across the country to censure uh efforts i mean there s just one after another south carolina gop centering representative wipes wyoming gop centering representative cheney clark county washington uh gop centering representative herrera boitler michigan gop you can go on ohio gop with representative gonzalez and i think like when we re talking about the sort of olympic level what about ism they ll be like well what about arizona democrats uh centering cinema one censure and that was wrong i called that out uh but it also wasn t censoring her uh over something like january 6th it was a stupid center over her ideological votes in and not supporting uh overturning the filibuster for voting right still a stupid censure in my opinion but when you stack that up against what s happening here to me this is an alarming trend within conservatives yeah and just anecdotally i know a ton of people who were trump people and no longer are and i think that there is a large and growing faction within the right who who feel that way and obviously there are still a ton that don t but i don t think that the way that the republican party is moving is really reflective of its entire base nor do i think that the way that the democratic party is moving is reflective of its entire base with with the filibuster reform or you have someone like manchin who represents a more moderate group of people and i think that on both sides we re seeing that definitely with the centering it s it s disproportionate with the gop and that s a specific issue but i think that we re seeing that we don t really have a two party system in this country i it s something that i feel very strongly about after january 6 it was the first time that gallup ever recorded 50 of people identifying as an independent i think that ultimately our country is going to be pulled apart if we have these weird purity tests on either side which certainly trump is the figurehead of that on the right and on the left it s more ideologically based um and i just think i think this is a moment to really say like there s no way that these two parties can represent the most diverse country in the history of humanity like this is just absolute garbage and there s no constitutional basis for them to even exist like george washington s farewell address was like don t let two parties pull us apart and now here we are so i think you know good old george knew what he was talking about but do you think there s a difference between ideological purity tests and which i i know exactly is part of the reason why we started last debate and i think part of the problem that the the right has and this is an ongoing fight i have with my father who s a big trump fan is that because it s a cult of personality then things like january 6 could happen which i think like that i d be hard pressed to imagine something like that happening within the left because the ideology of the left includes a basic respect for democracy but also there s no one figurehead that that you know democrats would barely hold it together to vote for the same person in an election um when you have a cult of personality it allows you to to go over the waterfalls in situations like then say no matter what this person says like i ve asked my dad before point blank while i was recording him uh trump said you know he would shoot if he shot somebody in the middle of fifth avenue would you support him and i asked my dad would you support him if it were uh if he did that and my dad said yes and then i said what if that person was me and he wouldn t answer that question he wouldn t even say i wouldn t support trump if he shot my own son and so and then you know my dad get mad at me because i have the audio so that s my own father that s __ crazy like absolutely crazy i think it s definitely different the like whether there s a figurehead and it s it s not a one to one comparison but i think that there s there s definitely like within the democratic party you have like the really progressive aoc kind of group and then the older democrats that aren t feeling that way like i i think it s just it s just reductive inherently to say that the american people are going to fit into these two parties and that these institutions are somehow going to be truly representative of them i think that we have way more than two parties in this country and i think that examples like this especially on the right demonstrate that there are a lot of people who are on the right who say no i don t stand with this and luckily pence s actually has the guts to speak for them on this issue yeah i 100 agree with you ricky that the two party system is broken and we need to abolish political parties all together in my opinion what do they call them at the founding the associations like they were associations yeah something like that there s a really great quote from washington which i won t try to quote off the top of my head but look it up the farewell address it was like it was like wow he literally predicted exactly what would happen he called it he definitely called it um speaking of associations laughter thousands of truckers and protesters have descended on ottawa canada s capital to protest vaccine mandates and work restrictions the mostly peaceful protests quickly became a media hail storm commentators on the right consider this the most successful lockdown protest in north america the left has pointed to confederate flags and nazi symbolism to denounce the protest as far right extremism now we ve taken a lot of time to dig through local reporting scrape social media and look up the organizers involved so guys what do we think this i think this is the first time on the show we ve talked a little bit about this protest that s going on with the truckers in canada what what do we think of this yeah we talked about our neighbors to north at all i don t know but it s canada you know we were i think you know we ve been we ve been seeing and thank you listeners and viewers we we ve skyrocketed in in u s uh rankings for political podcasts we re now in the top 50 but in canada i think we re the top 100 right now so we ve got some canadian listeners out there uh so i want to shout out our neighbors to the north i m going to try to do right by them by not overstating our knowledge on this situation i ll just say from a starting point that this is the kind of story that makes me excited about lost debate because when i look at the headlines you know you have on and one side you have headlines like canada s freedom convoy is a front for right wing anti worker agenda canada s truck convoy is just a stunt in a country where populism is still taboo and then on the other side you have critics mock puppet trudeau for fleeing capital during trucker s protest tyrant on the run uh and then you have go fund yourself the trucker convoy and great by the way like it s like your new york post headlines um go fund yourself uh the trucker convoy in canada is the most dramatic and most effective protest against covetera overreaching backseat mandates in north america that is medial polarization if i ve ever seen it i m not saying that these are equally valid points of view or invalid i m just saying from a starting point engaging with this story it is stark how much different like the two different like and different sides of the media are portraying the story definitely and it reminds me during the summer of 2020 the coverage of blm riots where on one side it was praising them and on the other side it was highlighting the very worst aspects of them and when you have large groups of people congregating there will always be the bad apples and i think that both sides use that excuse to not listen to the actual core complaints and i think we ve seen it now on the right and the left um with this specifically it s worth noting that this is being called an anti vaxx rally 85 of the truckers are vaccinated the organizers said in a press conference that they held that they personally are vaccinated um but they re specifically this is these are their own words the trucker convoy is not anti vaccination this is an anti government mandate many of us are vaccinated we simply believe every canadian should be free to choose and they also say that they won t block any emergency vehicles and that they ll help anyone in need so they ve laid out the ground rules i mean of course it goes without saying that the grotesque symbols that have been spotted i condemn entirely but that express an explicit goal i think is worth talking about and yet trudeau and the canadian leadership have not really addressed that and have really just honed in on the worst aspects of this protest and you know ultimately the the regulations here are pretty asinine because they re just now implementing a vaccination mandate only when truckers are crossing the border um and this it s a 14 day quarantine if you re not vaccinated regardless of whether or not you test positive or negative so these truckers if they re not going to get the vaccine they re not going to be hired they if they have an 85 workforce it s a very small amount of people but like they re not nobody s going to hire those guys to carry their stuff and we re in the middle of a supply chain crisis this is our number one trading partner and then omicron is happening where the vaccination isn t really stopping the spread maybe arguably it s slowing it but i think this is pretty rich coming from the prime minister who right now has omicron despite the fact he s yeah he s coveted positive but he s so dreamy though you can t say the vaccines are going to stop it yes explicitly that is the transport minister said in response to this our plan is to defeat coveton and the pandemic while trudeau is positive despite the fact he s vaccinated it s just this isn t a great policy for people who are in trucks isolated alone yeah it seems like a strange place to implement a mandate you know as you were talking about this earlier this morning about like how people uh you know they re not interacting with a lot of people these truckers yeah and i don t know like what what possible public policy is this i mean they still interact with some people when they re dropping off loads and i think the i guess crossing borders crossing borders and going to so many different places exposes them to a lot of different areas a lot of different people but i agree they re they re mostly alone most of the day it doesn t really make sense to make them have a mandate but this particular incident is interesting to me because there s so many republican politicians who are showing support for this protest um that s a little odd considering that all of this is going on in what is still technically a foreign country uh the gofundme account for instance we were talking a little bit about that uh after raising around nine million dollars gofundme terminated the freedom convoy account gofundme stated that they released one million dollars to the organizers after they provided details on how they would distribute the cash but then suspended the rest of the money after law enforcement said that uh previously peaceful demonstrations have become an occupation uh and then originally gofundme was going to try to keep the rest of this cast just like themselves well i think they were good well i think they were gonna they re gonna give it to other chairs yeah give it to other charities but yeah that s still kind of shady yeah and uh i agree eventually they walked back on that and they re just gonna refund it to the people who who uh who donated but i mean we don t have the exact numbers on this but a lot of those donations arguably probably came from americans right wing americans who see solidarity with these protesters but what if antifa blm protests in the summer of 2020 were getting foreign money to fuel their the fear of their organization what if gen 6 was fueled by russian money we would consider that foreign interference in our affairs how is this not foreign interference in their affairs from our part yeah one thing i do want to clarify is that i i think there s probably more than right wing people involved in this just given like libertarians there s like a lot of libertarians a lot of people on the left that i know don t like vaccine mandates too so i do want to i do want to acknowledge that but i do agree that the the wrinkle of you know cross state political or at least activist cash flow uh there definitely seems to be a double standard here i do agree that this is really shady by gofundme and i think musk pointed out that their you know gofundme had no problem funding it was i think farmers who were donating food to occupiers inside seattle during the floyd protest so it does seem like there s a double standard at work here and a lot of what happened with gofundme seems really shady uh and there s something facebook did i think around this too and they didn t provide details where they accused some of the organizers of some kind of q anon overlap or something but they didn t really explain it really well and this is why the transparency is really important to me these are private companies they could do whatever the hell they want but as consumers of it and also as a person who worries a little bit about the growing power of these things you d want a little bit more context and explanation about the way that they apply these standards and i think it s interesting there s kind of an ongoing partnership between local law enforcement or governments and these corporations now that are getting caught up in this this was pressure from the local authorities in canada that ultimately made gofundme change their tune and then pressure from ags in america who have people in their states that donated to this campaign saying we will sue you if you don t refund the money um and so i think it s it s really a strange kind of intersection between big tech and government and i think that it s it s a little concerning to see that these companies i mean are rightfully influenced by local governmental authorities and i think that that kind of boundary needs to be really established because ultimately no matter what side it is or whether or not you agree with it the idea of governments kind of working in tandem with these private companies could be really disturbing and could go awry ultimately yeah and one sort of i want to just acknowledge a couple things that i was trying to figure out in in light of this story especially for people who are in canada probably know a lot more about this like it was hard to get to the bottom of like what kind of unlawful behavior is happening at these protests like there s this you know the sense that they re honking and keeping people up and getting tickets for that or blocking streets and then there s the uh allegations of certain uh you know nazi symbols and other far right uh types of symbolism beyond like like traditional political discourse and going into potentially hate speech type stuff and there are allegations and i was trying to work my way through all this and and i can t say for sure too much other than the authorities seem to believe that there s there are laws being broken it seems like there s a wide spectrum of laws that they re implementing ever you know like things that seem really obviously problematic like honking in the middle of night keeping people up versus other things like that are you know kind of like nuisance type laws where you re not exactly sure what law they re implementing on paper yeah it s worth noting um in terms of the arrests um one has been for property damage one for driving while prohibited and five for mischief i don t really yeah you re not sure where that is yeah but i mean it definitely seems so far that there s not been any like severe violence or anything um that people were concerned about which we should all be glad about but um yeah it s it seems pretty murky all the reporting on what s actually going on it is very murky and i think it s just all it takes is for one or two idiots to ruin a protest like this i mean the inclusion of of nazi uh nazis just takes one nazis to ruin a party absolutely and i mean it doesn t make any sense canada fought against nazis i mean why would you have a nazi flag there there were confederate flags there yeah we fought that that s you though and we got no we we got plenty of them yeah which also doesn t make any sense but it really doesn t make any sense for people in canada to have confederate flags i m almost certain they weren t involved in the american civil war right we need them to be cool because if there is another one like yeah that s what we re going to have to do so yeah that s the american refugees now justin trudeau i just want to take issue with what he said he said today in the house members of parliament unanimously condemn the anti semitism islamophobia anti black racism homophobia and transphobia that we ve seen on display in ottawa over the past number of days together let s keep working to make canada more inclusive i don t think there was a whole lot of the the homophobia and transphobia there and islamophobia i don t think that there s any even records of that happening at this protest that we know of i m not yeah i couldn t find it i want to be careful to say it yeah i mean because it could be possible and i m sure there s some alignment but it just seems like trudeau is just trying to hit the like the political bingo card of all the different things that they have to condemn and you see this a lot with left wing politicians here it s something that i get really tired of it s like they say all these things well we got to stick up for all these different communities unrelated communities by the way we got to stick up for this community this community this communist community it s like you re not even talking about the issue at hand you re just just telling us all the people you basically want to support to the next election yeah i was looking at some polling on this from abacus data which is a market research firm based in ottawa and 68 of respondents said they felt they had quote very little in common with how the protesters in ottawa see things and 57 percent found that the protests were offensive and inappropriate while 43 found it respectful and appropriate now that doesn t mean they re illegitimate a lot of protests aren t necessarily uh like even civil rights i m not comparing this civil rights but even the civil rights protests uh at the time in the 60s did not have the majority of public support so like 50 plus percent is not the metric by which we we measure a good or bad protest but it seems like some of our friends up north have a look like they at least uh are taking issue with some of the things that are happening on the ground in ottawa right now definitely and i mean it s also kind of against the backdrop of some really strict coveted lockdowns and measures that canada has taken which have more been established by the provinces rather than the the actual like federal government there but um you know i think all of the talk about the obviously reprehensible uh minority of protesters who are like displaying flags and stuff i m not hearing trudeau actually talk about the issue at hand that they re expressly expressly there to protest and um some of the authorities have said that we re not interested in talking to the truckers or meeting with them they ve expressly said we re not going to consider rapid testing at the border or anything like that and and i mean they have a 14 day quarantine even if they test positive like this is just a weird mandate it only affects 15 of truckers and yet i think that there s so much energy because it s against the backdrop of like pastors were arrested in canada for having church services they couldn t have it outside they couldn t have drive in like there were a lot of really severe lockdowns up there that it s easy to forget as an american it s a hard job too i think that s worth pointing out like yeah when i see a poll that says they have very little in common with the protesters or how they see things i m like i m not surprised that most people don t have a lot in common with truckers because i think truckers are like they take on one of the hardest jobs that we have in society and just like for in a very different like way different side of the political spectrum i have a lot of sympathy for medical workers and i think i emphasize that a lot when i m when i m debating people who feel differently than me about certain covet laws um those are really hard jobs i think driving a truck is really hard and i have sympathy for people who are frustrated even if we have different beliefs on vaccines i think it it i could feel the frustration of having to do that job and then adding this 14 day quarantine and if you truly believe that the vaccines are problematic um even if i disagree with that you add that stress on top of this job it s tough i get it absolutely well speaking of covert mandates blue states have started dropping mass mandates this week new jersey connecticut delaware and oregon have all announced they will lift statewide mass mandates ricky this is something you ve been following closely is this good news i think it s good news that they re being dropped in schools um and so yeah the four states that you um announced those are all dropping mandates in the coming weeks and it s important to note that they are now leaving it open to the more local authorities so if a school still wants to have if a school board decides that they still want to have a mass mandate they can um and if a parent still wants to mask their kid they can if a teacher still wants to wear a mask they can but this is opening up some options and i think you know you can have a different conversation in the different age brackets of k to 12 but i think especially in the younger kids this is this is clearly a victory i think because developmentally in terms of their language their their social connection recognizing people kids who maybe don t speak english at home and need to read people s lips and really develop those skills i mean there s there have been a lot of studies that have found especially boys and especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have been struggling with their verbal progression in the pandemic especially and so i think this is a good step to allow this to be a more localized approach yeah and and ricky you sent me this article from the atlantic which talked about there s you know our cdc the national cdc is has been quoting the head of the cdc has been quoting this arizona study which uh claims to say that uh that schools with mandates were 3 5 times more uh effective at fighting covet outbreaks than those without it and like that s a that s a pretty strong statistic if it s true but as this atlantic article pointed out and other experts have pointed out there are major problems with this study so um there s noah haber who s an expert and author of systemic reviews of covet 19 mitigation policies said that the research is quote so unreliable that it probably should not have been entered into the public discourse uh and and he pointed out and others have pointed out specific problems with the study number one was that um the schools that had mandates had fewer days of school uh than the schools that did have mandates which alone you know you re going to spread it less if you re there less it also didn t control for vaccine status within schools like a really important piece of information um because i ricky i still believe that there s probably a chance that vaccine status um has something to do with spread i m not convinced of it with omicron but it s irrelevant at least like because if we later find out that being vaccinated means that you re less likely to spread it you d at least want to control for that in the study and it s actually a really easy thing to control for so that study was problematic there s not a ton of data that say that these school closures were effective i mean the the mass mandates in schools were effective and so yeah as much as like i i believe in masks generally especially the certain types of masks this seems like overkill so the cdc recommends that for ages two and up um everyone should be masked in a universal sense in school settings and you have some really extreme versions like in new york city kids are in recess outside wearing masks they re not seeing their friends faces they can t interact in l a which is absurd like outside uh huh there s no science there s no support in la they re requiring vaccination but they still have to wear non cloth mats even for sports like it s it s really ridiculous and especially like this is i m less concerned about high school students that s an inconvenience i mean i m still anti mass mandate i think it should be a more local uh situation but for the under five age group it s just absolutely ridiculous the who doesn t recommend it for under the age of six um the european center for disease prevention and control recommends against the use in primary schools and you know you have a situation where flu and pneumonia heart disease drowning guns motor vehicles those are all much larger dangers to kids in this demographic and we re really this like if there s one thing that i could do one restriction i could drop to make things go back to normal this would be the first one yeah i m with you on this and i m still believer in the protective power of mass so even after the mandates are gone and in new york and other places when i go to the supermarket and i go on the subway i ll still wear my mask if i m on an airplane how long do you keep are you gonna keep that up i don t know like i do think that like there are certain countries where when they had an experience with a pandemic it just becomes part of the culture and i could see myself in flu season all the time just wearing because first of all it s freaking cold in new york and i actually like wearing my mask now i m like one of those people who was allergic to wearing the mask outside because of what it said about you like to me it means that your anti science wearing your mask outside in new york um but i ve been wearing it in the winter because it s cold uh but and that also happens to be the same season where we spread germs more and so being on the subway wearing a mask to me it s not a problem but i m not sitting in school for nine hours uh and you know i m not gonna allow you to bring out the bingo card but there was a previous job that i had where that would make me really sympathetic to some of the people trying to keep these kids in line with the mask because like trying to keep a kid sitting up straight paying attention in class is hard enough nearly impossible in certain contexts adding another piece of clothing that you need to worry about i don t know i feel for people well by saying class i think we can figure out what that job was but this is my bill clinton i feel your pain episode i m feeling the pain of the truckers and the nurses and the teachers and that s why everybody i m running for nothing i m not running for i would hope that yeah yeah on a c3 we can t do that when when are we going to get rid of the mass mandates here in new york when wouldn t we think that s going to be sounds like coco is going to make an announcement on thursday i believe are you doing any reporting on this for the post um i m not at the moment i haven t covered that personally but i know that you have a you have it what 18 months can you imagine masking him at the age of two what s your take on that he would take it off and throw it at us and just yell at us for the next hour for even being bold enough to attempt to put it on him yes for sure uh our last story we re going to go inside the metaverse once again with robbie who has an update for everyone s favorite and least favorite digital universe what is going on with china in relation to the metaverse yeah shout out to the economist had a really good article this week about uh chinese incursions into the metaverse now you might be like well the metaverse kind of doesn t exist yet what are they doing uh well strap in here s what s happening a lot of people thought that china actually would be averse to the metaverse in many ways like they ve done things like you know restrict the amount of time kids can play in video games they obviously have like a really strange and restrictive approach to the internet generally and you could imagine that the metaverse would be a threat to china because it s it s potentially a and it s not just one place like they re going to be multi meta versus meta versailles i don t know versailles yeah there should be a meta versailles i would visit that but they uh but uh you d think that it would be a threat to china because you allow people to cross borders to express themselves the way that they want you know change identities but china i think senses that this could be a threat and like any authoritarian regime they re looking to shur up their standing in this new area so that they can ward off i think any uh potential threats to their power and maybe even use it as a tool of their power and so here are just a few examples of uh developments in china in the metaverse so in december and january the cities of shanghai wuhan and haifei put the development of the metaverse technology into their five year plans which is how they basically make decisions and implement government in china in november um the xinjiang uh province held a metaverse industry development symposium where speakers agreed that uh this is this is the area that s home to alibaba group by the way that they re going to be the forefront of the technology in october the chinese institute of contemporary international relations which is like an elite think tank within china affiliated with the government described uh in a paper on the metaverse that the next generation of the internet is going to be the metaverse and that they need uh laws to deal with quote virtual labor economic crimes and other areas uh issues in the gray area so we can imagine what that orwellian double speak means you can keep going there s a think tank at the ministry of industry and information um which called on tencent baidu alibaba um you know to basically make take certain steps in these directions and it s just and this is on top of the fact that just within a few months last year a billion dollars was invested in chinese metaverse technology companies um and they have the players for this so they have 10 cent they have alibaba they have baidu and 10 cent is particularly a player to watch because they re you know one of the if not the biggest video game company gaming company they are among the biggest and when you put together the sort of collection of technology companies that china has they have a lot of the the sort of rails that could allow them to do well here like headsets um sort of vr ar technology uh their own versions of cryptocurrency um which you could see like china was cracking down in bitcoin but they re gonna they re gonna try to create their own and own their own rails so i think this is a huge threat how much money do i have to have to get into the metaverse right now it s expensive i don t remember i actually the last time we did a story actually looked because i was like all right if it s you know if it s at a certain amount price point i was like all right maybe i ll throw a little money into the metaverse but it s expensive i think ricky you looked at something i remember you saying yeah i feel like i don t know i m gonna quote it wrong but i think it was like eight thousand dollars for the cheapest real estate or something like that it was in the thousands and it s cheaper to new york still yeah i don t know but this whole thing thing feels really analogous to me of like the wechat thing and how they they ban specific technological platforms and make their own kind of um like uh government authenticated versions and i feel like this you know it s easy to have this new terrain of the metaverse and think it s gonna be really utopian but i think this is probably a pretty good example of how i could go really awry and we should tread lightly into that territory if you ask me it s almost like a certain kind of digital space race and there s this the saying in china which is like overtaking on the curve which means beating the west on a key technology before the west gets there they did this on 5g they ll do it on 6g which a lot of people think is going to be six g s yeah i know there s going to be a 60 uh but they re actually pretty good in certain ways they re definitely doing this in genetics which is some really scary tea leaves on that front uh and so they re looking to overtake the us in this technology and it s tricky because if they succeed in developing a robust version of their metaverse which i think is inevitable that they re going to create their own version of it it might just mirror what we have now you know where there s a chinese version of it and then there s an american version of it and they don t necessarily interact which is kind of a bummer because i think i don t think that the metaverse is necessarily going to be good or bad yet and it might be complicated like like the internet is today but there s a world where the internet can be freeing to people like if you have a disability the metaverse can help you express your way if you if you want to express yourself as an able bodied person which not not everybody with a disability necessarily wants to but if you wanted to you could or if you had if you identified differently than um what you ve been genetically given you can uh or like the way you express you can do that you if you if you re in bangladesh growing up in poverty but you want to interact with americans but you can t leave your country or afford uh to get on a plane then you can interact with americans or canadians like or whatever um and or if you re like in you know family that s separated in india pakistan or in the palestinian territories in jordan you can interact with people uh in a more tangible tactile way than otherwise could there s so much potential for good here and that s why i wanted to bring the story in it because i don t see the media covering this other than like a mocking of zuckerberg which i m for it let s mock zuckerberg as much as we want but i think because he was one of the first people to really get out in front of the metaverse and call this company meta i think people think of the metaverse as only facebook but it s not there are ton of different technology companies in this the the book is just starting to get written if we re if we re looking at this book now we re on page one of the metaverse and so i wanted to keep coming back to this because i think this has the potential to be one of the most if not the most significant technology story of the next few decades more uh important i think in many ways than cryptocurrency i actually think they overlap because you can imagine people transacting in cryptocurrency in the metaverse because you know if we re doing this cross border tactile um sort of exchange of goods and ideas etc uh one way to get around all the complicated uh laws around you know the flow of currency is potentially to to transact in the currency of that whatever metaverse universe you re in and you can imagine that being cryptocurrency some interesting stuff we ll have to keep keep an eye out on it so we got a couple of follow ups we want to address from a few of our previous episodes there s been some changes to some stories that we ve talked about one of them is changes to this story about brian flores the the former coach of the miami dolphins what updates do we have there yeah and i actually should have thought of this when we did this story last week but i ve done some i ve seen some articles that were speculating that flores the former coach of the miami dolphins who launched this lawsuit against the nfl we did a story on it what i didn t mention the story was the possibility of an arbitration clause in his contract and people have speculated and they ve looked at other coaches contracts at least as of today i haven t seen confirmation that there is an arbitration clause in his contract with the dolphins but there has to be and i should have thought of this now what is the uh and people have shown other coaches contracts to say hey there are these arbitration clauses and why is this significant because you know you do this when you sign these random waivers with technology or you re going to the gym or whatever a lot of times you sign away your right to bring a lawsuit in traditional court when you interact with a big company and a lot of people are critical of these clauses i certainly am and what happens is you go to an arbitrator who s supposed to be neutral but these are not neutral parties most of the time they re companies that that want to keep business with these companies and so the nfl i think probably will pick the arbitrator that happens often and obviously those arbitration companies are not going to piss off the nfl so it s basically a way to for for lawsuits to go to die but uh where i sit right now i m not sure if that arbitration clause would apply to all the other claims about other teams because he might the the contract i think would only govern i think his relationship with the dolphins yeah but not the broncos on all these other giants and everybody else there s also a federal agency that you can bring these types of claims to that um is a commission that can investigate the claims and it it the arbitration clause has nothing to do with that so uh there s a world where whether you know flores gets money or not or some of these corrupted measures happen or not the the nfl is still like squarely within uh the sort of sites of some sort of discovery process some kind of prolonged process and so they may decide to settle this even if there s an arbitration closet issue yeah does throw a small different wrench in that case though another thing we wanted to look at was we did this study on lockdowns we talked about this study on lockdowns we didn t actually conduct it but we talked about this study yeah we re busy around here yeah we re yeah uh we talked about this study on lockdowns last week i know ricky you had a lot of opinions about this particular piece and there has been a couple of updates on that yeah so um essentially the way that we left it was kind of debunking some of the claims that there was no rationale behind what studies were picked and we left it kind of in the place of we d like to see what the experts have to say and a lot of experts have weighed in there s a lot of controversy surrounding the study um specifically i think the biggest issue is what they consider a lockdown and theoretically under their definition any form of sort of mitigation policy could be counted so even if you just had a mass mandate or something and so there is a lot of back and forth within the medical kind of epidemiological community and i so obviously this isn t something that i can speak to as a non expert but i definitely encourage anyone that s interested in it to dive into some of the twitter threads and different articles and arguments that are floating around in the web about whether this study is valid and i ll be interested to hear if the original authors do respond to these criticisms ultimately sounds good well we

being here the book is dignity in a digital age and we ll get to that in just one moment you have been writing since you were in your teens getting published too i might add here is you you schooled george h w bush in the leadup to the first gulf war let me read a couple of these clips here that we re in a letter that you sent to the bucs county pennsylvania courier times my grandfather spent four years in jail alongside gandhi your comments about white construction helping colonialism is dead on and influenced me to care about peace and human rights and i was opposed to going to war for material reasons stephen you re 14 year you say with animosity between iraq and the united states escalating the chance of war occurring increases as each day passes you go on to say this is a war that will be brought on because of a materialistic society that evaluates only on the economic aspect go on to say every soldier s life has a priceless minority value we should demand full support economically and militarily from all nations and must have no doubts in engaging in war the 14 year old has a clear yea about armed intervention you re on armed services right given the russian buildup on the ukrainian border we re 30 years later facing another potential war what should the united states strategy be first there is absolutely no justification for putin to invade ukraine and we have to be clear about that second we want to exhaust all diplomatic options and i think we have sometime hopefully because i don t think putin is likely to go in during the olympics especially because of his relationship with china so the president made it clear that there will be tough financial sanctions but he ought to have diplomatic solution and actually ukraine s own president is calling for calm and i hope he and secretary blinken will exhaust the diplomatic solutions and i think they can avoid war we have to avoid war applause i hope you re right your district is home to apple intel and yahoo and your new book dignity in a digital age is about how to make tech work for all of us first question and i need this mean this semiseriously what is the internet what has it become as opposed to what its intention was the simple questions are the hardest here is how i would define it it s a network of computers connected that allow us to communicate share ideas in a virtual space stephen i ve always thought of it as an agreement between these computers as to how we will communicate with each other and that the problem now certainly in terms of privacy is that some of us are being harvested without our knowledge so no communication is given to us about the knowledge that is taken from us the agreement is one sided i completely agree i mean and it s compromising your freedom i mean think about it these people who are running these big tech companies can know what you re going to purchase they may even be able to know what you re going to think they may know what you re next going to do based upon your data and they can take your data and get you political candidates that you don t support even tim cook has a commencement address where he says freedom to be human is contingent on respect for privacy stephen is privacy necessary for dignity absolutely how can you have a freedom to think a freedom to be free a freedom to make mistakes if i ve hi single thing you re doing is being collected you know what they do they collect this information and target the most vulnerable i mean q anon grew because facebook and other platforms inteksly targeted other people with conspiracy theories and let to their growth instagram for teenagers like your worst experience at junior high magnified and it s leading to teenagers are serious teenagers have depression are committing soup side they know what s going on and they can stop it they don t have to have everyone liking everything and sharing everything you don t come on the show and spew misinformation think about if you spent your hour telling lies to the country while why don t you do it it s not because you fear being sued it s not because you fear political repercussions it s because you have some sense that beyond the comedy and the ratings you have something you want to do public good why should it be different for social media maybe you don t stephen i m checking with my producer that is why we do it applause laughter you write the dirty secret in silicon valley is congress will hold a hearing but nothing changes you want to create an internet bill of rights what are the top three things that have to be in the bill to make a difference the biggest thing is before someone can collect your data you need to say yes you can take the data stephen so the default is privacy and we have to opt in exactly because right now the default is they get your data and you have to click everything to figure out how not to give them your data no one does that and the user service agreements how many people actually read the user service agreement stephen i read the part that says i agree exactly stephen yeah and they manipulate it they have dark patterns they put the box bigger with the right color so you click on it it s a very sophisticated thing but the very basic is no data should go without your consent the second part is you should know what s happening to your data and right now there s no way of knowing if we had known cambridge analytica probably would not have happened because nonprofits would have known about it asked about it and not allowed donald trump or other candidates to use data but it s offensive that people who didn t support a candidate your information is used against your will to support a candidate you don t support stephen

seeing around the country is already the groundwork being laid to essentially have a coup so a redistricting frenzy is underway across the country it is map makers and politicians picking their voters rather than the other way around fewer people are aligning with the gop s platform and so in order for them to hold on to power they re going to cheat it wouldn t have to be a violent cool it would be a coup by legislative process music over the past 10 years texas gained about 4 million people in total population 95 of that population was people of color despite people of color fueling the growth over the past decade there were no new majority minority districts drawn in either the state senate the state house or the congressional map and in fact both committees made an effort to reduce the number of majority minority districts on all three levels there was a particular attention to a district just north of austin in a county called bell county that is home to a sizable black population and in this county we had two districts placed within its boundaries that looked like a donut there was the outer ring district and then there was the inner district that basically worked to cut up the population of the two biggest cities within that county basically ensuring that people of color in that county could not elect candidates of their choice some of the worst districts were in the greater houston area and into the houston suburbs and fort bend county in particular congressional district 7 take part of populations in harris county and then also cut up the aapi communities that have grown tremendously there over the past 10 years because of these maps that don t accurately reflect texans and their values we get a legislature that is passing laws that are not favorable with the people of texas and this includes senate bill 8 known as the texas heartbeat law bans almost all abortions in the state the texas bill is unique permitting almost anyone to sue any person or provider who may have helped someone get an abortion after the limit north carolina is really a true 50 50 state roy cooper who s our democratic governor won reelection by 51 the same election where trump won the state really all the statewide elections you see are right down the line we would hopefully expect that our state you know politics that our congressional members would reflect that but but they don t because of because of gerrymandering in the maps that just got passed the communities that are being targeted to dilute their representation are all urban communities they re all the places where communities of color are you know they re taking places like greensboro it s a growing town it s our third largest city has a very large historical black population that city is basically being scooped out of its county and paired with really rural mountain counties that are very far away have very different interests and are demographically very different even if democrats are winning more than 50 percent of the votes they re still ending up in the minority in our state legislature and our state legislature is deciding all these really impactful things i mean we re still one of the few states that hasn t expanded medicaid it s something that the vast majority of north carolinians want it would give health coverage to 500 600 000 people in our state who really really need it there s this just huge mismatch between what the people of the state actually want what they ve actually voted for and what they get georgia has 14 congressional districts and under the map that was passed republicans have between nine and ten of those seats which is really remarkable in a state that is one of the quintessential battlegrounds right now georgia is very much a 50 50 state almost evenly down the line what we saw last decade is the emergence of an increasingly diverse multi racial georgia tech gwinnett county for example which is in the suburbs of atlanta you know in 1990 gwinnett county was 90 white it s only 30 white today and yet that is not at all being recognized in the maps that the georgia legislature passed in the atlanta suburbs michelle al is the first chinese american woman elected to the georgia state senate her district is about 62 percent non white and in redistricting it s transformed to a district that s 52 percent white it goes from being a biden district to a trump district in ohio on the congressional map there are 15 congressional districts republicans are favored to win 12 of those in any given year democrats only three which is wildly skewed in fact you know that s about 80 percent of seats in a state where republicans at most win about 53 percent of the vote music we have reintroduced hr4 the john robert lewis voting rights advancement act hr4 will create a new coverage formula to determine which states have been the most egregious actors and subject them to pre clearance that is based on a current evidence of voter

homicides 15 sexual abuses 182 robberies and 317 instances of motor vehicle theft in washington dc that s one month of crime in this district a teeny district washington dc is without a doubt one of the most dangerous places to live and it has been that way we don t get a wall the powerful get a wall and security detail don t believe the bs that dc suddenly became dangerous they didn t care when it was us they only care about the powerful the elite and themselves when it comes to the overall proportion of homeless residents no state compares to washington dc of the district s 700 000 residents approximately 7 000 of them are homeless one person out of 100 is homeless in washington that s three times what the number is in california overall 19 of dc residents live below the u s poverty guidelines that s horrific that s a fifth of the city in poverty space for lease business for lease business for sale you see it all over the city washington dc i ve lived here for 10 years used to be a place with bustling businesses you couldn t even find spare space to put a business in now all over the city all you see are businesses for sale business for lease why is this this is specifically because washington dc had one of the most brutal lockdowns for coronavirus they closed down restaurants multiple times shut down the city shut down businesses and then allowed the mobs and the rioters to loot them this what happened all summer long it was horrifying for businesses and those that were not corporately sponsored shuttered right now dc is a ghost of its former self many business owners tell me that it will be years before dc gets back if it ever comes back this is a sad sign for a once bustling city nearly half of small businesses closed in washington dc due to covet 19 and the restrictions placed on the businesses by the leftists who run this city drove businesses into the ground unnecessarily this is cruelty one of the other things you end up seeing in this city now in washington dc is apartment for rent it s house for sale studio for rent places are going on to the market because people are fleeing this city has become expensive it s become dangerous and much of the business associated with it has been sent out of the city vis a vis the coronavirus and the draconian lockdowns that have affected our city this is what is happening to your nation s capital union station the crown jewel of washington dc architecturally one of the most beautiful buildings here in one of america s most prized beautiful cities now sent to ruin absolutely empty you are here in the middle of the day in the middle of a work day in a place that would have been one of the busiest most bustling most thriving areas of the city trains coming in and out metro station coming in and out a bunch of restaurants businesses by the dozen completely shuttered this is a direct result of dc taking itself off the map when it comes to tourism and off the map when it comes to location you would want to visit or do business in in front of the white house now the home of joe biden what is joe biden protected by walls not one not two not three layers of walls here in blm plaza the same thing gates walls refuse barriers police why because this is precisely the reflection of the entire dynamic of washington dc the protection for the powerful and the rest of us left to fend for ourselves a city in decline a city of chaos where violence mobs riots reign supreme where homeless encampments are allowed to spread to some of the most iconic areas of the city where the residents live in fear and are fleeing where people are losing their jobs and businesses are crumbling cratering but the powerful are safe and sound protected behind the same walls and barriers that they called racist that they called evil for the last four years protected behind big beautiful walls where they feel safe the rest of us left to fend for ourselves in the nightmare that they created this is the absolute ruin of washington dc this is what the left is doing to your nation s capital do not let them do it to your city this has been benny on the block in washington in a blizzard benny

episode of sac town talks today we have matt haney joining us candidate for the 17th assembly district matt how s it going and thanks for joining us it s going well thanks for having me i am so you re currently uh running for the 17th assembly district which used to be i guess you know kind of uh uh vacated by david chu can you kind of tell us about kind of your decision to run run for assembly and kind of what you re currently doing sure absolutely uh well we re one week out from the primary so fast special elections that came about because of a vacancy there was some political uh shuffling here and different appointments and such that led to it opening up uh you know i m born and raised in the bay area raised by a single mom i went to public schools i went to public child care i went to public university at uc berkeley and i ve really had you know incredible opportunities that have come from investments that our state has made but we have a lot of big challenges that we still face as a state and as a city i represent downtown san francisco currently which includes the tenderloin and south of market we have thousands of people that are still living on our streets uh people who are unable to access health care or treatment for mental illness we have a housing affordability crisis in san francisco that i know extends all over the state where housing is too expensive for most folks and we aren t building enough housing and so all of these things are things that i ve confronted at the local level with solutions on those issues as well as economic inequality and clean energy but san francisco even a city of our size and our wealth can t solve these problems alone you know we really need much bigger bolder statewide solutions that get us to net zero emissions that build housing in every community so there s enough for people especially young people to be able to get housing uh and and invest in the future and uh and make sure that we re investing in critical public institutions like our public schools that are still underfunded um so that s why i want to go to sacramento i ve i ve spent my whole career in public service i ve represented people who are facing evictions i chair our budget and finance committee here in san francisco i ve worked in sacramento as a legislative aide and run statewide advocacy organizations and uh and i and also i like sacramento i like the people there i like the work that gets done there i like the city uh and i m excited to be able to spend more time there and and take on some of these big challenges we re facing you know it s so interesting because a lot of the folks who are you know elected to the board of supervisors or over here to sacramento from san francisco are never born and raised in san francisco they re always from the east coast ivy league educated coming back to you know coming to san francisco you know this you know one of the first kind of homegrown candidates we ve heard from in a long time can you kind of talk about you know being a local and kind of growing up there and and kind of what that means to you know your constituency sure you know san francisco is a place that welcomes people from from all over the world and and so we do have a lot of people who who end up in san francisco for a whole variety of reasons including in our leadership but i ve always been a barrier a person a barrier kid you know i lifelong giants niners warriors fans i actually represent the giants and the warriors currently they re in my supervisor district so that s uh that s an honor uh uh you know itself as a bay area kid but uh you know the bay area is an amazing place san francisco is an amazing place my grandparents still live here they re 93 and 92 they ve been here my whole life wow the place that really has such incredible creativity and innovation and love of diversity and uh you know and it s been it s been at the forefront of so many changes over the years on civil rights on lgbt rights and so you know to be able to be from here and represent this place and also bring the voice of of people from the bay area you know to sacramento uh as i said you know i ve been here and have benefited from so many opportunities as many have in our public schools and our in our public universities and so uh i do think that being a san franciscan a bay area person and representing the city is a special honor for me and i hope it gives me i i hope i can come with some level of understanding of what people here care about and what they go through and what their needs are yeah kind of you you mentioned earlier that i guess you uh graduated you know you went to public school you went to berkeley can you kind of talk about kind of your your journey from you know graduating from college kind of where you are today and kind of give us a little background sure yeah well actually you know my my first job out of college was i went and worked in sacramento i was a legislative aide for a state senator there and so i i you know a lot of the things that happen in in sacramento really are unknown to many californians you know we focus a lot more on the federal government we focus more on local government but many of the big big issues that impact our lives whether that s public education or health care universities criminal justice issues are decided in sacramento and so it really gave me that insight into how important the work is up there i spent just about a year and a half up there and then i ended up in law school and in my first year of law school i uh got caught up in uh the barack obama wave in 2008 i working for the campaign and working for him and going to the white house and leaving law school for some amount of time and that that experience also i think really taught me about uh the positive things that could come from politics you know in my my generation we had seen a lot of of the negative things you know the iraq war and different things that i we you know i was organizing against when i was in college but then we saw the barack obama campaign and for me it was a really awakening of hey you know we can actually accomplish things in politics we can get good people in there we can achieve things that maybe we didn t think were possible and so that really brought me into organizing in my own community i came back i started non profit really getting closely involved in schools working with kids raising money volunteering in schools i got my law degree in my master s in education ran a non profit that did education advocacy and then decided to run for office myself i was elected at 29 years old to the board of education here in san francisco i served for six years there including for a while as the president of the board and then ultimately you know saw the connections between the challenges that educators and families and kids were facing in our schools and what was happening in our neighborhoods in our city where people couldn t afford housing or we had over 2 000 students who are homeless we had challenges that really were bigger than what could only be accomplished in our schools which obviously is still very important so i decided to run for the board of supervisors and so um that journey has led me here to want to continue my path in public service and bring the things that i ve learned here uh and in the work that i ve been able to do to the state level so so you went to law school you got your law degree did you ever practice law did you ever go and get your license or work for a firm yeah i am a member of the bar i still pay my dues every every year and i have represented people who are facing evictions i ve practiced for some amount of time as a tenant attorney i taught education law at jfk law school and uh also taught at stanford and the design school there so i i have practiced some law but i never i never went the big firm route i i did get offered a job at a big firm but decided you know my my path was going to be more in public service you know we got a lot of staff who listen and you know that s always one of the questions we always get is you know is it worth going to law school if you have a career in politics kind of what s your opinion on that uh well i still have a lot of law school debt and so it does cost a lot of money uh i really enjoyed law school you know i met a lot of good people i learned things i got exposed to opportunities i m sure it s helped me in my in my journey now as a lawmaker i don t think it s essential in order to go into public service so i i feel like for people who want to run for office or they want to go into politics sometimes because we see so many lawyers in politics we think oh i have to do that first in order to go into politics but i i don t think that s at all the case i think that uh we really need more people who are you know teachers or doctors or or sort of from other professions nurses small business owners um in order you know to get into politics as well and i think people respond well uh to people who are not lawyers because there s already a lot of us a lot of lawyers in here but you know a lot of people become lawyers like i did because i wanted to advocate for people right so it does make sense you know at the same time if you want to have it okay for people you don t have to become a lawyer first yeah well well put especially with all the debt that comes with it yeah yeah i think i m gonna be paying this off for the rest of my life you know i look at it every time i m like well just it s just the interest keeps going up you re talking away yeah so i think you said what ballots are coming out next week is that right yeah ballots are out right now so we re you know my team is here we re already working on getting the vote out and you know uh we ve identified a lot of supporters so we re now just trying to make sure that they vote and uh yeah it s pretty it s pretty uh we re in the middle of it yeah so i guess how many candidates are there and kind of how s the the campaign looking right now yeah there are there are four candidates uh and uh you know i feel good about it i m the only sitting supervisor who s running and i ve been able to really i think have a uh a track record on things that are important to people here which i i hope is still what what will determine the outcome of this and what people care the most about you know not only whether you ve talked about it but whether you ve done it and you know during the pandemic i was very visible here on a lot of big issues you know our vaccine roll out i was deeply involved in making sure we were again getting mass vaccination sites making sure we re getting homeless people off the streets into hotels during the pandemic protecting workers so you know i think all of those things uh for me are what my narrative has been which is that i m you know a progressive leader but also someone who s been proven who s been effective on and taking on big challenges and ultimately that i ll be the most prepared to do that in sacramento so so far it seems to be resonating i think we re we re in a we re in a very good uh spot to hopefully uh you know uh win in the in either the special primary or in a runoff right so i so you have the primary now and then let you know there is a chance you get what 50 plus one vote and then you could be in right away but if not that would be like a top two runoff sometime what later what maybe june yeah april 19th will be the top two runoff okay wow everyone expects that there will be a top two runoff it s just you know there s a few strong candidates so the idea that somebody would get over 50 is is pretty unlikely i mean it s possible right but uh it s unlikely and so what what s the final election date then for this election uh the final election date for this election is april 19th is the general election runoff uh the other the primary is on uh february 15th right so okay so wow only what seven more days uh wow seven more days yeah after we finish here i gotta i gotta jump back on the phone and call people for money that s what candidates uh have to do and unfortunately the other side of the story yeah so how are things in san francisco i know that the pandemic has been pretty tough on it you know we see things in the news regarding crime and stuff uh you know how what is the pulse of the city right now and how san francisco bouncing back you know san francisco has been hit i think uh harder than a lot of places for for for a number of reasons you know we are a city that really does rely a lot on visitors and whether that s people who come here for big conventions like tech companies and such or people who visit uh from all around the world one of the most visited cities in the country and so we have a whole hospitality sector that relies on that we also have a lot of folks who work in offices downtown and so that that leads us to a place where most of those folks aren t coming in right now and so san francisco really in many ways during the pandemic has has been a shell of its former self and we ve taken the pandemic very seriously so we ve had some really strong regulations which i think you know has saved lives and have been a good thing but it s it s set us back economically for sure and so our you know my hope is that we are in the on the forward march now and we re not going backwards in terms of reopening our city and getting folks to come back into offices and getting tourists to come back and conventions to come back and everything and when that happens san francisco will will come back as well san francisco is a place that just has so much to offer its beauty its diversity we have so many you know leading companies uh in the world that are headquartered here so san francisco will be fine uh we do have challenges that have been exacerbated during the pandemic just like a lot of places i mean i was in sacramento and it was a similar kind of feel you know on k street and a lot of people were experiencing homelessness a lot of businesses shut down so it s going to take a little while for us to rebuild and also you know address some of the challenges that we already had like homelessness that i think have gotten worse everywhere during the pandemic yeah kind of you know as a candidate you re obviously going door to door talking to voters kind of what are on voters minds right now uh you know i think that uh you know they re worried about the the cost of housing and whether we re building enough housing that s a huge thing uh they re worried about homelessness and and crime you know they they do feel that things have gotten worse and i think in many ways that they ha it has you know exacerbated by the pandemic uh you know they see uh what they what what feels like an increase in homelessness and concerns about that and sort of whether our city is city and state are going to be able to confront those things you know they re worried about small businesses and overall quality of life which i think uh all of us are concerned about uh you know and then there s the big things that i get to talk to people in in this race about which it doesn t come up as much in a you know on a local uh situation but you know climate change is a huge concern you know the extreme weather events that we re seeing so i think that san franciscans are probably uh in line with much how much of the rest of the state is feeling right now we want to see things get back to normal but we re also concerned that on some fronts with some of the challenges we were facing before the pandemic that things have gotten worse and we really want to see the type of solutions that can confront those issues kind of you know going door to door and talking to people you got any really good memorable stories from the campaign trail right now uh any really good memorable stories um well you know i mean i i am always um trying to kind of keep the pulse of you know what s happening in our in our neighborhood i walk around the tenderloin a lot which is where i live i did get to chat with somebody the other day who um this is going to be the first election that he is able to vote in um you know we passed a law our first local election at least we we passed a law uh just a little over a year ago which now allows uh people who are on parole uh who served their time and around communities for them to be able to vote and uh that that s that s that was a really um heartwarming you know to think and this is true also for people who turn 18 or who are newly citizens or such but when you meet people who this is their first election and they get to vote and that they they re telling me they re going to cast their ballot for me that s something that s very humbling and uh so that without i had that moment just just last week chatting with a guy on the street and he was telling me how excited he was to be able to vote so it is also a reminder you know some of us have to have the have the privilege to be able to vote and um and don t uh you know and so it s also important i think um that for a lot of people it s a big deal and if we do have that privilege we should we should use it yeah kind of i guess you know being a board of supervisor is there some you know sometimes i m sure you must get frustrated that there s something you can t do your hands are tied because of of state law uh kind of what are you looking forward to coming to do in to sacramento and come change so uh kind of untie your hands and help your community yeah you know this has come up some uh you know we re dealing with like much of the state a a a crisis an epidemic related to drug addiction and drug overdoses and there have been some areas where i d really like to see the state either provide more help or in some ways like you said stop tying our hands you know people who need access to treatment uh prescriptions need to be able to have lower barriers to get those um get them enrolled in those treatments and the state in some ways makes it hard and and creates barriers for people to get enrolled in treatments that can get them off of opioids we we are in san francisco losing nearly two people a day to drug overdoses uh it s it s tripled over the last few years and across our state you know this is now what you know much more deadly even than than covet and so you know that that is something that i really want to help lead on expand treatment beds but also make sure you know the people who are out there interacting with people have the tools that they need you know whether that s certain um laws related to conservatorships and getting people who may not know that they need help into help and then reducing some of those barriers so that we can enroll people in treatments so that s something that i that i m you know i think as we as we move out of this pandemic we re gonna we really need to focus on some of these issues that are still huge um problems and have gotten worse and i think drug addiction is one of them especially with fentanyl we have a lot of big issue with fentanyl which is something that s 50 times more powerful than heroin and kill somebody with a very small amount wow you know with the election coming up you know you said there was four other candidates is that right what kind of distinguishes you from the other candidates in kind of why why do you think you know people should vote for you over the other folks um you know i i i think that things have been really hard over the last few years for for san franciscans as they have from much of the state and a lot of the voters are going to be asking where were you you know what what have you done for me lately you know were you there did you support our small businesses and help them stay afloat did you make sure that we had access to vaccine sites and testing sites did you help with the challenges around public safety or for housing and uh i ve done those things for for our residents and in a way that i think stands out in the field that when music the residents here really needed leadership i stepped up and because of that i m prepared to step up in sacramento on their behalf i know what their needs are i know what they ve been through i know how to get things done i am not running as an ideologue or someone who is gonna you know point fingers i m running as somebody who and i have a track record around it who s gonna roll up my sleeves and i think that s what you know is going to distinguish me in this race and also hopefully make me an effective assembly member in sacramento oh well well but well i know you know time is tight for you and you got to go get the campaign trail but thank you so much for joining us and if listeners want to check you out or your campaign how can we get a hold of you yeah matt haney com welcome to sign up or or send us a note and

run away and that s what they estimate to be about five to ten percent of the the actual traffic is is running away so 10 of the 1 4 million 10 on top of that yes that s their best guess and that s just looking at the footprints trying to establish how many people were in that group all of this ground they ll drag it two or three times a day so that they can look at the trafficking coming across um they re running cameras and then there they ve got the ground sensors so you may not necessarily see a truck but then there s always eyes on this area just wouldn t do it so now we have a world class security system at the border including the highest technology sam come here with me look at this look at how effective this wall here is the correctly installed wall yes john this is the

approved the boundaries of their new congressional districts and as of tuesday 46 lawsuits have been filed in 17 states challenging the new maps on grounds of gerrymandering and racial discrimination my home state of alabama happens to be one of those states go figure where a special court in january ordered legislators to redraw their map since it diluted the power of black voters there the supreme court thought otherwise however voting on monday to halt the special court s ruling and reinstate alabama s new map um so for people who aren t aware of what gerrymandering even is ravi do you want to give like a brief description of just what this is and why it s so problematic yeah every 10 years we give a census in this country and you know it just means we count our population and you know population shift and so based on uh that data we have a process called reapportionment which means that we re divvy up the congressional seats in the country and so some states may gain some states may lose and and because of that also individual districts within states also may lose or gain populations and so you have to redraw congressional lines uh within states and so that process happens after the census every 10 years and it s supposed to be a basic process where you have these contiguous districts so like you know like that the district should make some kind of sense like maybe they re a square or something but over time the you know the partisan nature of our country being what it is people have begun to game the system the political parties and so when one political is in part one one political party uh has control over the designing of maps versus the other they re gonna maximize their gain and they write they draw all these crazy lines to to just and they re now using sophisticated statistical uh um uh models and and experts that can basically maximize their hand and minimize the hand of their opponents and there s some states where this is like absurd and i m just gonna make up these numbers like like where you can like say maybe it s a 55 45 state but one party will get 70 80 of the seats because they re that good at this and so this is a big problem and what s happening is you re seeing fewer and fewer swing districts around the country where dave wasserman who s like an expert on at the political report put the number of swing districts in this country at somewhere between five and six percent of districts yeah as of 2022 with this redistricting it looks like it s 23 out of 318 districts are competitive which is pretty ridiculous for a country that s almost 50 50 so that s just seems entirely undemocratic at face value yeah it s insane when it comes to this particular map in alabama there was three judges on a panel that basically said this map is you know it s gonna dilute the voting power of black voters there you only have one district in which black voters have power and they basically wanted them to redraw the map to give an additional district that was basically what they call a minority majority district where there were more people in it that would have been able to help decide you know the fate of another district in alabama who was going to be uh representing that district two of the judges on that panel were trump appointees so this wasn t even a super partisan thing they were just literally like this is just not right the way you ve drawn this map is not right now the supreme court has uh basically you know halted that decision they ve gone back on it was a five to four vote uh chief justice roberts actually sided with the liberal judges on the bench in that um what s really interesting is that there was a congressman out of alabama in mo brooks he s a big trump guy and he said it was wrong for this lower court to try to force alabama to draw maps based off of race but alabama already draws maps based off of race and i m going to do this quick enough i m going to show you how alabama has already fully done that we have a prop here today this is this is alabama and this is its congressional uh districts now i want you to pay close attention to the seventh district here this is the only district in alabama in which african americans have any significant voting power a lot of these counties right in here are what they call the black belt these are counties in which there are majority black uh voters in all of these counties but there are also majority black populations in a lot of the cities in alabama that are nowhere near any of these counties yet they ve all been grouped into one convenient district look at the shape of this thing why does it cut up look how far down south these counties are yet this district cuts all the way up into here into oh what is that birmingham this particular city has a large african american population its suburbs do not have a large african american population so its suburbs are right here in this other district yet its city cuts right in there included with all these counties that are nowhere near it also look they also decided to include tuscaloosa that s where the crimson tide play if you re a college football fan some of their residents are a heavy they have a heavy african american population there but only in certain parts where they cut it in to this little sliver right here and then look how it comes all the way over this part of alabama has nothing to do with this part of alabama and yet they cut it all the way over to get just a little tinge of montgomery south montgomery where a lot of african americans live this shape makes no sense this is not a shape this is like look how many sides to this this is like a dodecagon or something like this is so many sides to this and this is the way this is like gerrymandering a physical like a physical description of what gerrymandering looks like when they cut these districts just to include all the people into one district so they have no power over any of these other districts insanity if i ve ever seen it well that was a great description and i think this is the problem with the the modern system right now and and why i support efforts i think one of the the voting rights bills that democrats were pushing on the hill would have been they had voting rights yeah would have would have uh banned partisan gerrymandering and i think what s interesting is that democrats have been saying that they were going to be the victims of gerrymandering in this cycle but all available evidence suggests that alabama aside uh by and large democrats have actually won so far the redistricting battles i think the american public has lost because you know districts like my home district in staten island uh was a true swing district it s i think it s changed hands four or five times since i was a kid from one part of the next and uh it is uh it was a state where you had to really make an argument and you had to be on your toes as an elected official you had to really serve your population and pay attention to their needs and now it s been redrawn to make it significantly more democratic not necessarily safe but way less competitive and right now basically the way where we stand is that republicans had control heading into this process of way more state redistricting processes but they they ve come out so far losing seats from the redistricting process so one analysis we saw has democrats at the moment of being plus 11 in adding democratic leaning seats in this process now we only have 32 states as of this data that have wrapped up their process so so much can happen in the remaining states but because of certain states like new york that were so aggressive in redistricting out republican states and because of this phenomenon around the country of republicans inexplicably doing way more incumbent protection than they probably should have democrats i think have come out way stronger than they expected heading into this process and i think the problem here is in any one state nobody wants to unilaterally disarm nobody wants to say i m going to be the responsible one and create the commission all that i mean it has happened but it s not as widespread as it should be i think we need national reform that s the only way we can get through this and fix it it s worth noting that california michigan idaho arizona colorado and washington have all done either like both parties together redistricting or totally non partisan commissions that they have independently had redraw and it s doable states have done it on both sides of the political aisle and i think that you know this is where my andrew yang kind of supporter comes out here it s one of his platforms in the forward parties the idea that we should have these independent redistricting commissions because 80 of districts are considered safe we have a 90 re election rate and we have the lowest approval rating of congress ever so this is just not a system that s working for people and i think even like going back to your point corey of like the racial elements too it s a really sad reflection of the fact that our two party system has incentivized politicians to look at people based on immutable characteristics of groups that they can win or that they just can t even think about or it s just it s so reductive what this ultimately does to people and to voters and i think it s really it s it goes back to 1812 but that s not a constitutional element of our country and it can be changed and i think it should be yeah i have an example of this too which is my my district was staten island plus like bay ridge and bensonhurst which is actually like culturally a very similar district the new district that s proposed will now include park slope sunset park which is actually where i was born now there are there are a few places in the city as different as park slope and staten island and one outcome of this could be there are there are rumors that bill de blasio is going to be jumping into this race for this district now there could not be if you went to the the candidate factory and you were and you set you put the settings on most anathema to staten island values i don t think you could design a candidate more unpopular with staten islanders writ large than bill de blasio but there is a world where he could emerge in this primary because it s now added a bunch of like park slope types like him to the electorate and a lot of the primary electorate will come from that and so it could be that he emerges as the primary candidate even though the vast majority of people in this district cannot stand the man the guy murdered a groundhog on staten island and covered it up he eats pizza with a fork you know what i m saying this is a guy who used to show up to work late in the after you know seven o clock you would work out at the ymca in brooklyn and then he d show up to work late and set down his bluetooth and during the pandemic with the lockdowns here this is a working class a lot of city workers a lot of teachers firefighters police they hate him uh and so to me this is an example of and i saw it in nashville too is like they split that district now and nashville might not get its own representative now um because you could have people like representing the the excerpts of nashville instead of the city itself like it s absurd and people are being disenfranchised around the country absolutely it s just a terrible process and de blasio with the groundhog like what was just a just a murderer now allegedly alleged murder but there s there was there was a youtube slaughter yeah manslaughter okay they weren t they were totally upfront about this and and like shame on you staten island zoo for how you participated in this a great zoo uh everybody should go visit it but i think they they allowed themselves to get dragged into politics here well let s let s hope he doesn t re emerge as a candidate because that would just be yeah we don t have positions on campaigns like the only unifying issue of like everyone ever that like the only thing americans can agree on or at least new yorkers is that we all can t stand de blasio like we don t take a position on the actual election we just dislike him yeah let me put my c3 hat on a second and say he has not announced there any campaign so this is totally this is totally fine if he does then we have nothing to say about it yeah we have absolutely nothing to say about it and yeah so we re neutral in that race i could you couldn t tell or super new super nature music

pandemic and the war in ukraine there s been another big story flying a bit under the radar and that s joe biden s nomination for the supreme court katanji brown jackson much of the focus has been on her identity after biden pledged during his campaign to nominate a black woman to the court but jackson has a stellar resume she got her law degree from harvard and she s been a federal judge since 2013 when she was nominated by president obama since last year she has served on the dc circuit court often called the second highest court in the country she served as a public defender earlier in her career which would make her the first nominee since thurgood marshall to have criminal defense experience in the last of her three federal clerkships she works for stephen breyer who is the retiring justice she will replace the interesting thing about all of these accolades that i just read off which are just stellar and amazing and i think she s very qualified for this position is that i haven t been hearing a lot about these accolades in the mainstream media coming from either the left or the right and it just seems that because biden fixated so much on her identity and the left also is fixating so much on her identity and that s being weaponized by the right it just seems like that s become so much a part of the conversation it s i mean i mean you probably saw this when obama was running it s like everybody s like oh first black president but like nobody really talked as much about like why he was so qualified for that job in the first place and i just see that as a troubling trend here uh for instance i have a couple of tweets i just want to point out anna navarro from cnn tweeted that on campaign two years ago at joe biden promised to nominate the first black woman to scotus when vegas he came up he said he d deliver on that promise but damn watching him nominate katanji brown jackson flanked by kamala harris first woc women of color vp is still so emotional and inspiring and i m sure it is um but there s no mention there of any of uh miss jackson s qualifications don lemon says president biden formerly nominates catania brown jackson for the supreme court if confirmed should be the first black woman to sit on the high court congratulations long overdue still no mention of that she went to harvard and how you know qualified she is and again i think it s incredible that the supreme court is probably going to see their first african american woman but when you make it solely about that and you don t at all talk about the qualifications that s going to be weaponized by the opposition to say oh she s an affirmative action hire when she clearly isn t yeah i m with two minds of this i think i sympathize with anna navarro because if you know if you haven t had a single black woman on the court and then you see somebody nominated to it i could see that being an emotional moment right and i i don t i don t begrudge her for saying hey like this got me emotional and the way that like for instance like obama uh you know being you know getting the nomination being president to me was i m not even black but i m somebody who s half uh white and half something else and just like the idea of a biracial person somebody who opposed the iraq war all that like it was emotional to me i get that and i and i and it s a travesty that we ve had such a homogeneous institution this long and as we ve talked about in previous segments it was kind of a bind that that biden was in because i think we generally came down in the kind of incomprehensible belief that he should have nominated a black woman at least this was my position but shouldn t have promised it if he could have gotten away with not promising it which i ll save people the comments on youtube it doesn t make what i just said makes no sense it s not a very courageous stance um but now that she s nominated i do think it s really important like you said to talk about her accomplishments and to make it about that as much or more than anything else and i think in contrast to you know my my now widely shared views about paris this is a no brainer pick she s super qualified i love the fact that she is a former public defender yes there s not enough of that yeah like if you look at just the weight of former prosecutors former doj officials former judges there s not enough of the public defense bar represented in office i happen to to be around one who is the former mayor of nashville carl dean who used to be the city s uh city s top lawyer which included their city s public defender and he looked at things differently given that experience so i think this is welcome i think her experience obviously she s usually credentialed she comes at it from a different perspective she seems like she s going to be um she s just you know she ll be a liberal but she ll be a different kind of liberal potentially on the bench we knew liberal was coming which is why they re like i don t have that much more to say about that yeah yeah and i think um beyond just her credentials she s also a good pick because i think that she s uh probably going to be confirmed or at least more likely to be confirmed because just in june she was nominated to the dc circuit and three republicans voted to confirm her lindsey graham susan collins and lisa murkowski and that will definitely make them look highly ideological to say oh you were you were qualified for this position but now that you re the opposite party s nominee you re no longer qualified between last june and now and so i think that um republicans will definitely be in a tough position given that so that also makes her a good pick on just a strategic level too yeah and i ve been doing some things since our last segment about this and i think there s not enough of the emphasis of the blame on the historic actors who ve gotten us to this place right because i think like so much of our outrage in mind including in during the last segment was like biden making this promise all these people making about identity politics and i and i definitely have my opinions about that but not enough about like how the hell did we get to the point where there wasn t a black woman on the court after all these years you know and like why not enough emphasis on the fact that there was obviously clear racial bias over our country s history i m not saying that s your bias but i m saying like in general like a lot of the people who are getting like especially like people who are trying to criticize biden on this from the right like i m like i m kind of with you on like the promise having some issues but like can we also like really get into the fact that this was a problem in the first place like an acknowledgement of the problem of the lack of diversity like some kind of answer about how you re gonna do anything about it right like what are you gonna do if you re not gonna have a litmus test what s the answer here when you have such an imbalance racially you know for the first half of this country african american woman couldn t even vote or hold office and couldn t even go to the colleges that would be required to get the experience to be on the supreme court so and not that not to mention african american men also suffer from that and women in general also suffer from that so there were barriers put in place for for much of this country s history to make it where the supreme court was a majority uh white male body uh and again of course i have no problem with this pick and i think she s like i said overqualified for for this pick but again the focus on identity the only thing i will say the caveat to that is we did the same thing with harris a lot of the same thing with harris and it comes when you look at her actual track record she wasn t as a a friend to the african american community especially if you look at some of the things she did as d a in san francisco as as you know you would think and so that s all i say i just say that we should we look at these individuals let s look at them for more than immutable characteristics to look at them for their track record their accomplishments everything and weight that along with all of these other things that we want to promote in this country and that s that s really all i have to say

turning to like the politics of this now kind of as as we re seeing all this kind of change like or how many like clear red seats are there how many clear blue seats are there and did they create more purple seats are we gonna see more competition here uh in the coming years and you know seeing who was elected yeah so in the last uh 30 days i ve been trying to spend more time on my bike than think about congressional districts but i think i still remember these numbers um so uh the districts that came out really were probably pretty good for democrats um uh there are two districts in particular that republicans basically had flipped into democratic seats um and that would be the valedio district in uh the central valley um that is uh you know that it s a majority minority district that comes down into bakersfield and goes north from there not the mccarthy district and then the mike garcia seat in that santa clarita one the one i was talking about where like people are calling in and saying you should be in and all backgrounds the republicans that organized that stuff they lost and that district is democratic so those should be two democratic pickup opportunities those should happen in 2022 but if republicans held on to them they should happen in 2024 but those districts are kind of off the list of republican seats basically from the metrics we could talk forever about whether or not the metrics are good there s also the michelle steel seat which is this uh little saigon seat that goes up into fullerton and it is one that i literally drew the exact district in my prep and it was a new idea for a district but it was creating a more of an asian opportunity district and uh that district is on paper democratic but um it ll be harder for democrats to win that because they don t have like a great bench there and so they re going to be you know they don t have like a sitting assembly member who can run for that they don t have a sitting state senator who s going to run for that so it s it s going to be a little more challenging also the late census data i call the late census data incumbent protection like it wasn t that s not why they did this in the census late but the late census data meant you had later redistricting which means it s like voila you ve got your lines and the person who s the incumbent has their campaign team their fundraising their their organization their endorsements their their whatever and they re ready to go and some challenger like they might have the best district in the world but you know they don t even have a campaign chair they don t have a fundraiser they don t have endorsements they don t have whatever and now the sudden you have 60 days before the you know filing deadline and you re like kind of screwed so the michelle steel seat is one that s democratic so that s basically i d say on paper republicans lost two and a half seats democrats left one seat because they lost the lowenthal seat so net gain for democrats i think in the plan overall which um from all those ensembles wasn t really supposed to happen democrats were supposed to lose one interesting so like you know you work in a lot of states you you see kind of what goes on nationally you know i guess is our model you know the best you you know in the in the understanding california is the best um we re the best at everything best weather the best at everything um i think the california process is the best process because it allows for a commission that has shown in these last two iterations to be high quality you know above reproach in terms of their kind of partisanship and that make up the the process one of the things that some people might say they don t like about the commission process is that we don t have like a strict competitiveness criteria in other states they re supposed to look at like is the number of seats that democrats and republicans going to win proportional to their share of the votes in statewide elections um we don t have that standard we have like a partisan blindfold where they re not supposed to know or care about where the partisans are and just draw districts based on the rank criteria um i like that process um i like the fact that our commission is the final say and they implement the lines as opposed to a commission that s kind of like a suggestion and it goes to the legislature and then they get to haggle over it so this true independent commission process i think is definitely the best michigan did one this year um that was basically the same process a little different um i am a little bit more skeptical of the outcome of michigan because they did had some problems in drawing of the black districts um vra issues that i just didn t think were right so um but then there s other states that have different versions of this uh but that california model i think is the best i i would love for it to be the national model there is a national bill that requires states to have commission commissions it would also have that competitiveness criteria language in it i wish they didn t but um having a commission structure nationally would be much much much better than these political footballs you know that s kind of interesting because yeah originally you think oh yeah competitive that d be good right but if it doesn t really represent the you know the local or the people then what does it matter it s kind of like one of those things where um when you have it s really really harder than people would think you need districts to all be whole pieces equal size not violate the voting rights act and then as you start to tack on more criteria it gets harder and harder to draw like perfect districts and if you say like districts have to be competitive that s great in a sense but you are going to end up subjugating the other criteria so if you were to say california map like california map isn t quote unquote competitive it s not proportional the california map california elects republicans or california voters vote on the republican side of the ticket between 35 and 38 of the time roughly in the last couple of statewide elections for you know congress and governor and president and that kind of stuff so republicans should have 35 to 38 of the districts based on the way the lines are drawn now they have like depending on which house you re looking at and what metrics you re using they have anywhere from 12 to 20 percent of the districts so we would have to take our map and then now adjust it to create more competitiveness and how would you do that like you would take democratic leaning republican districts or democratic leaning districts and like try to shove more suburban white voters in them you know like there d be a lot of things you d have to do to really distort this map to make it be a 35 percent of republicans getting elected and in fact it might be like a look like a republican gerrymander to do it so competitiveness just adding that additional additional criteria it s going to end up subjugating the other criteria and it s just in my view more harmful than good make sure you click the

debate a show for political eclectics i m robbie gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlot well a lot happening in the world today it s just like too much stuff going on way too much the us is on high alert for potential russian cyber attacks as moscow looks to retaliate against crushing sanctions a guest speaker at uc hastings law school gets his speech drowned out by a sea of protesters why was this guest not welcome you guessed it an issue involving race and speaking of race fort lauderdale is racing to the bottom they are down a police chief but they might be up a college basketball referee but first things first let s talk about energy let s talk about oil as of this morning the national average for a gallon of gasoline is at its highest in history 417 and that makes today s announcement that the u s is going to impose a ban on russian oil a tricky proposal we re banning all imports of russian oil and gas and energy that means russian oil will no longer be acceptable at u s ports and the american people will deal another powerful blow to putin s war machine now over in europe some countries are so dependent on russian energy they re not willing to go there but the white house is willing to go it along despite these surges we re seeing at the pump so ravi what is your read on all of this well the highest gas prices that we ve had in recent memory were 2008 and we re actually slightly below that in in inflation adjusted terms so we re still not there yet but i i m confident we ll probably get there very soon based on what s been happening this week and i think people may be confused because we ve been told that the us is uh self sufficient uh with for energy since 2019 that we re energy independent but just because we produce enough domestically doesn t mean that we don t import oil because we re actually exporting uh oil in certain cases uh while bringing some in and i think one of the weird reasons for this is the market economics most of our refineries are in the gulf coast and we re sending a lot of that abroad just because i guess it s it just makes sense for these companies they they re able to trade at a higher at a higher um per barrel amount and then we re bringing in oil including from russia in our coasts uh and the east and west coast and so we take three percent of our crude oil comes from russia which is not that much but the refined oil which is what you put in your car is 21 uh in part because of those refineries and the gulf coast are sending so much abroad so we are dependent on russia in a way and so this is going to make a huge difference so it s already sending a price shock around the world and obviously this is this touched off a huge debate domestically about biden and whether he s doing enough yeah so obviously biden has gotten a lot of criticism for his expressed policies or desire to uh kind of pull back on a lot of our oil productions and pipelines and stuff but i think that there is admittedly some misplaced blame um even though he came in with like a hardline stance against any further oil expansion and signed a federal or executive order almost immediately upon assuming office that would prevent any new federal oil drilling on government lands that ultimately was shut down by the court and in the end did not come to fruition so i think that there definitely is misplaced blame but there also was a legitimate expressed interest in on his part to um kind of pull back our production so i m glad that the court blocked it obviously because we never would have expected to be in a situation like this but this goes to show that you know as much as as we do care about the environment domestically there are really important and intertwined international issues that play here as well yeah and as part of that you know biden has actually outpaced trump in issuing drilling permits on public lands there and there are 9 000 approved oil leases that oil companies are not currently tapping right now and in part what s going on is we had this weird situation in the middle of a pandemic where oil was trading at a negative value meaning it was more expensive to hold oil to store to store it um than its actual value was at that time and that s because nobody was going anywhere and there s only so much capacity to store oil in this country and uh there s this entity called the american petroleum institute which is essentially the lobbying arm of uh big oil and they came after biden recently saying you know ukraine s essentially his fault uh and in part what they pointed to ricky was what you talked about which was his intention early in the administration which was uh at least when it comes to federal land which is you know largely what he can control he could control federal land he could control uh domestic stockpiles strategic reserves which he s released he was releasing some of this before any of this um they went after him saying this was essentially your fault which i find really interesting because this is a an entity that has been lobbying against any sanctions on russia continuously going back to crimea going back to the interfere interference in our election going all the way recently to january when russia was amassing troops on our border the american petroleum institute was cautioning congress not to be rash in part because a lot of these oil companies have had strong relationships with russia now to their uh credit some of them like exxon have pulled back recently but only when it became untenable for them and so uh this is you know to me i m frustrated with oil companies i m not one of those people who who thinks that like oil companies are the only big bad that we have on issues of climate change but it is frustrating this is an entity that has fought the u s response every step of the way and there s tons of evidence that oil companies are actually slowing production or at least dragging their feet on increased production because they re getting record windfalls like the scarcity is actually to their benefit yeah there is this narrative and a lot of people where i come from in alabama are really pushing this narrative that joe biden is somehow solely responsible for these high gas prices that the government is somehow solely responsible for these high gas prices and based off all the things that we just said that s just not true i mean the oil they re producing in the gulf for instance two thirds of that gets exported overseas you know not to mention there s a difference in the type of oil that we can collect here in america versus the type of oil that is more usable for instance west coast refineries rely heavily on what the this russian type of oil called light sweet crude which is just an awesome name it sounds like a soda or something that i would drink and this is a oil that s easier to refine and easier to turn into gasoline for us whereas some of the heavier crews like for instance the keystone pipeline that everybody talks about that bite and shut down it would have given us this uh heavier crude called heavy tar sands oil which is just much worse for the environment and harder to refine so that that s a big part of this too but when we talk just on that before you move on just keep in mind when i said about the refineries too right uh if we re only getting three percent of our imports from russia on the crude on the crude oil then the keystone pipeline really isn t going to make much of a difference on this front it s the refined oil that s really the the difference maker when it comes to russia and that s what we re getting about 21 yeah from russia yeah that s a big thing so speaking of russia um ricky so we re about to shut down importation of oil from russia but that s pretty much a no go for europe why is that yeah it sounds like we re likely to stand alone um there were some talks that maybe japan might follow suit but in terms of europe and the eu that doesn t sound like any sort of sanctions on oil or energy coming from russia is going to happen uh 41 of the eu s natural gas is imported from russia 27 percent of crude oil uh 46 7 percent of coal and even though the eu climate chief the european commission president they have all been pushing um energy independence uh even seven years ago i was listening to a video of the eu climate chief saying we need to be independent from russia um it s clear that that never came to fruition and we re really seeing the consequences of that now zelensky um is calling for bans on russian uh energy imports instead some would call it an embargo others would call it morality when you reject giving money to a terrorist and so it sounds like that s not going to happen though because the eu requires a unanimous vote of the 27 countries within it and especially germany is not going to do that because they are enormously dependent on russian energy they are the largest economy they re the largest importer of russian crude oil um and they ve kind of had like a um a change through trade idea that if if goods are crossing the border then tanks won t and that doesn t really seem to have come to fruition um they re pushing back on all the plans to sanction russian oil especially because it s still cold there and they really needed to heat people s homes and luckily you know this didn t happen in earlier in the winter when there s more time that we might have like a potential real huge need in germany for for oil to heat homes but um the winter and how that and how long this progresses will ultimately play a huge role ricky correct if i m wrong they dragged germany um which i think as you mentioned is that the largest economy in the eu right they they drag their feet on nuclear right yeah they um they shut down a ton of nuclear plants and their and their dependence is huge but they ve kind of changed their tune a little bit they ve been criticized also for keeping a very small portion of their gdp and putting it into defense and they ve kind of they ve decided to um change their tune and and promote uh domestic oil production and energy production as well as increase their defense expenditure but it seems like it s a little late for that yeah it s not the kind of stuff that s going to show fruit overnight no well there s a historical reason why germany would not want to put a lot of money into their military now um as far as we re concerned here in america with us shutting off which i mean biden as we speak is announcing that we re pretty much going to stop importing or from russia for the time being the question then becomes well who replaces that and there s been a lot of talks about saudi arabia uh white house press secretary jen sackey would not confirm this past monday if uh biden was going to go to saudi arabia but there is talks of that a trip to saudi arabia to ask for increased oil production would be a hat in hand trip for president biden who promised the nation that saudi arabia would pay for the slaying of khashoggi we all remember when that particular incident happened you re referring to a a journalist a journalist and and i m not sure he was either a washington post journalist and he wasn t he you know he died in mysterious circumstances that seemed allegedly the saudi incredibly allegedly uh defeat of very powerful people in saudi arabia yes yes yes so there s a lot of criticism on both sides here um representative omar has criticized u s talks in with saudi arabia in light of what s going on in yemen uh while marco rubio on the other side of the aisle has also criticized handing our oil production off to authoritarian countries so it s kind of like a zero sum game a no win game here for biden and i think people are overselling saudi arabia here because russia puts out 4 5 million barrels per day in crude exports and 2 5 million barrels per day other oil product exports so put that number together at seven uh million barrels per day right and there s an analyst at goldman sachs who pointed out that basically the magnitude of russia s exports are you saudi arabia will barely make a dent in this and that you know saudi arabia at best can add 1 million to that number uh on a daily basis and that opec as a whole can add 2 million so that s just a small part of this puzzle here so you know let s say we get opec and saudi arabia to add that 2 million every day which is it s a tough sell right and involves a lot of trade offs like who knows what saudi arabia is going to be asking in return yeah and these aren t always the most transparent conversations right so you ve got that and there s tons of reasons to think that opec won t go along with this yeah ties between some of the other opec countries and russia for example but yeah and biden s been critical of some of these countries so then you gotta you can then you gotta go to venezuela iran um we ve got to make uh you know trade offs domestically right where as we ve talked about we re already you know biden put for sale a huge part of the gulf um for for drilling i think was one of the largest sales um for oil exploration and history like we re already making tons of trade offs so this is kind of a scary world just thinking about how do we even get to that seven million barrels per day now we might not need to get to seven um because people aren t following us but like let s say this war escalates and that they do have to follow us then we re in real trouble and this is on top of the fact that there s already kind of a silent embargo going on like there some people are putting the number to two to 2 5 million barrels per day that russia isn t exporting just because of the private sector boycotts that are happening in russia so this is tricky well that s not the only thing that s scary and that s not the only thing really threatening us when it comes to russia and the the possibilities of things that they could do to us while russia threatens spiking energy prices they ve got another slightly nerdier weapon too cyber attacks we know moscow has serious capabilities when it comes to this and we also know that the u s does not exactly have an impenetrable defense when it comes to this now the department of homeland security has warned that russian cyber attacks could be imminent and that quote every organization in the united states is at risk so ravi how concerned should the average american be about cyber tax and how prepared are we to handle them yeah i think you know all aspects of our government and private sector are bracing themselves for cyber attacks from russia and obviously russia has a huge history here and some people like senator mark warner in the senate have talked about potentially us going further and that we have an obligation to our nato allies that if they re attacked in a cyber attack that maybe will uh invoke uh nato s article five like so collective defense so world war iii you know so this is this is you know at least to my knowledge one of the first times this has been you know cyber warfare has been thrown in with uh article five outside of you know esoteric security conferences and this comes as uh there was a really illuminating uh opinion piece in the new york times recently by glenn gertzel who s the former former general counsel of the national security agency is one of the agencies that is really you know involved is heavily involved in probably our offensive and defensive uh cyber warfare and he said that the us is vulnerable when it comes to cyber attacks and he particularly points to the fact that we don t have a centralized uh entity within our government that s tasked with uh our cyber defense and cyber offense and um he did point to the fact that biden has consolidated coordination within the department of homeland security but he pointed out all sorts of problems with the way that this is configured like the lack of authority the dhs has to push private sector actors to do the right thing um the lack of um um you know turf over like the vast array of the types of policies that are happening and essentially what it boils down to is one cyber attack on say our transportation infrastructure uh is probably going to rhyme with an attack or use similar capabilities on something else within our government like let s say our energy infrastructure for example and the fact that we have different agencies tasked with handling these different responses and they have limited ability to push the private sector to do certain things given the the nature and the importance of some of these uh pieces of infrastructure that we re in uh we re potentially in a world of trouble here and and something could be coming very soon that could just add to the chaos that we re seeing uh wow yeah it s insane yeah and there s definitely a ton of different fronts not just like the commercial the financial the infrastructural the governmental um issues here but also the personal data risks as well and it s coming from all fronts kind of at the same time we don t know what angle russia might potentially try to hit us at um but it s also worth saying that according to the international institute for strategic success we re the form of cyber super power so even though we might not have the best defenses necessarily we are kind of strongest um in the sense of our infrastructure digitally so yeah a little bit of there is a history here on the offense front which is like i guess it s cold comfort because it s like i guess i i want us to have good offense but i really really want us to have good defense you know our history on offense is pretty significant here we had the stuxnet in 2010 we basically shut down a nuclear reactor in iran and a lot of people say it was one of the most sophisticated cyber attacks in history in 2019 um there was an attack on a russian electrical grid that you know there allegedly came from people from u s cyber command so we have our history of offense russia has their history of offense in 2017 um they used a cyber weapon called not pettya which wired called the most devastating cyber attack in history and it started in ukraine but then rapidly spread throughout the private sector across the world and so this is this sucks like you know you have two you know major powers uh you know launching you know unprecedented cyber attacks on each other that are rippling across our economy and harvard they have this center called the belfor center and they issued a report on our cyber defense and this is what they said they said to say that the us is not prepared for a cyber 911 is an understatement and employs the wrong analogy this country and its people its businesses and his government are already under attack yeah that s that s insane i mean good offense is nothing without a good defense everybody knows defenses win champions the bills know this from from our playoff history yeah yeah i m sure they do you know there was a solar winds attack that occurred back in 2020 in which they were basically hacking the state department the pentagon we all remember the colonial pipeline attack from last year that basically shut down a pipeline in houston and it caused a lot of gas stations in the southeastern united states to uh you know basically for their prices to go up so this is something that could really affect just the average person and i think we definitely you know government s got to get their __ together they got to consolidate this because right now there s approximately 80 different committees and subcommittees that claim jurisdiction over various aspects of cyber regulation that s way too many hands in the pot yeah there s and there s a lot you know russia is not only home to a lot of this sort of institutional cyber warfare but it s also home to a lot of you know individual players and so you know there s that problem of hey the big uh corporation or the government entity getting hacked uh and then there s the problem of like my dad responding to like a random email that steals his financial information and his identity and there s a lot of reason to believe that both those problems uh overlap with russia pretty significantly you know the unfortunate reality of how we live right now is we need russia to crack down uh you know it s it s hard to ask them to stop the institutional stuff because that s like in their interest and that s that has to do with global diplomacy but you want them to crack crack down on the the you know the the small time entrepreneurs because at least in in that case you can imagine like they have less of an interest in allowing that stuff to flourish within their borders and and i i m not sure we re going to see uh we re not gonna see like a pretty um vigorous reaction from russia moving forward on this stuff yeah well tell your dad to stop opening those emails i mean there s no nigerian prince that s gonna that s gonna refund him that money let s move on a panel event at uc hastings law school went completely haywire last week after a group of law students shouted down a guest speaker named ilya shapiro he was supposed to talk about the supreme court confirmation process but he caught so much flack from students over an earlier tweet about potential candidates for the supreme court a tweet that the students called racist that he was drowned out at this event by protests now ricky you are the uh free speech person on our panel here uh walk us through this yes so this starts um back in the end of january with um ilya shapiro is a cato institute scholar some more on the libertarian end um than the conservative end necessarily um and he was appointed to be the executive director of georgetown center for the constitution and then um a week after his appointment he made this tweet during biden s appointment to the supreme court kind of speaking out against using immutable characteristics as a litmus test for who he would appoint suggested that this indian american judge should become the appointee varian artfully worded and he used the phrase lesser black woman in the tweet he later apologized for and he said that he did not mean to cause offense but obviously that phrase in this context is is hard to swallow for a lot of people and so this ended up with a um a huge sit in at georgetown people demanding reparations demanding uh like areas to cry on campus and just a meltdown on georgetown s campus demands to fire him in the end georgetown put him on a paid administrative leave with a pending investigation that s still in place and then now he went to uc hastings and he was shouted down pretty vigorously banging on tables just completely could not say anything for the entire hour the students that were there to listen to him could not hear him speak music oh the professor that was there to oppose him actually said to one of the protesters that he supported the protests and it s important to make the delineation that no matter what he said this is not a defense of what he said this is a defense of academic freedom and you know you have to support what you agree with and what you disagree with and certainly this was an inartful phrase that he used but in the end shouting down speakers is never the answer that s not how free speech works especially in a public institution like uc hastings and luckily the school condemned that in the end but it s not a good look for our future lawyers and something like 200 plus uh professors at georgetown came to his defense yes yeah even nicole hannah jones uh said there was nothing to investigate with his ongoing investigation at georgetown there s also you know georgetown has a little bit of a hypocrisy problem here too because there s this other professor in 2018 i think her name is carol christine fair and she tweeted the following in reference to republican senators who supported brett kavanaugh she tweeted look at this course of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist arrogated entitlement all of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps bonus we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine yes now any guess as to what happened to her what did georgetown do did you get a promotion nothing they defended her saying this is her speech she s entitled to say it uh and that to me is problematic because it s saying this is a this is a clearly liberal person saying crazy __ uh now she should be able to say that i don t think she should be fired for that i certainly wouldn t want to take her class but like she s entitled to say that but i think what you re seeing is a double standard where you have as you described ilia shapiro who is a known conservative who says something objectionable and is put on administrative leave now who even knows what what s going to be said there so it s like oh what s going to happen there right like what happens to him is it even tenable for him to remain on campus after this so that to me is the problem not what he originally said yeah uh and there s some really smart stuff out there there s you know i john quarter wrote an interesting piece where he said basically i really hate what this guy said but there are multiple interpretations of it and i generally come out um were recorders but i think even if you don t come out where john recorder is on that like this double standard is ridiculous yeah the double standard aspect is pretty ridiculous definitely so i m a fellow at the foundation for individual rights and education and they came out with a statement after this about why shouting down a protester is never the answer or shouting down a speaker is never the answer that s not a valid means of protest that s that s using your speech to obstruct someone else s speech but there are tons of other things that you can do you can turn your back on a speaker you can hold signs you can ask questions you can write an article about how much you hate them before after they come onto campus you can hold a competing event at the same time to draw people away from it there s a million things that you can do but ultimately our future lawyers in this country especially you know at georgetown which is a really prestigious law school it s concerning to see people who feel like they can t listen to or tolerate or feel comfortable in themselves when they hear distressing or potentially offensive things because law can be extremely distressing and extremely disturbing and they re going to have to be in courtrooms you know litigating very intense like potentially violent crimes and so you know these are our future leaders and we need to make sure that you can you can vigorously oppose speech but shouting it down or insulating yourself from from viewpoints that you don t like is never the answer especially at somewhere like georgetown or uc hastings yeah well i mean based off of the tweet the guy definitely doesn t get a lot of points from me but i do totally agree that he shouldn t be fired and as for the __ shouting down speech thing i also agree with that it s not smart to uh shout down speech whether you re at law school or whether you re during the state of the union um yeah um so let s move on the city of fort lauderdale has fired its police chief larry scarado over complaints of discrimination in his promotion process but this was a case of discrimination we rarely hear about an investigation found that the police chief unfairly focused on minority candidates while hiring now he s only been on the job since august but it certainly appears like he never won over the department when multiple senior staffers turned on him in an investigation into his hiring practices on the bright side the former top cop does moonlight as a college basketball ref so he s got another gig in uniform to fall back on but in all seriousness um what is going on in fort lauderdale well let me tell you what s going on this police chief larry scarado who s actually the first openly gay chief hired in fort lauderdale and uh he is of mixed race background now he took this chief position after being a former uh assistant chief in pittsburgh where he served for 23 years and basically he was given the one of his first things when he was a police chief was he was supposed to promote someone to a higher position i believe he was a captain position if i m not uh if i m not incorrect about that and he had a bunch of senior staffers in the police department help him make this choice the senior staffers decided that there was an individual lieutenant charlie stutters a white male with 20 years on the job that they all agreed this was demand for this job and scorado said not charlie he said it s going to be between these two and he pointed out two other police officers that he wanted to give the job to and apparently when he was trying to choose between these two other candidates he said which one is blacker and i i guess saying that he was going to give the position to whoever was the the blackest of the two uh one witness reportedly said that minority status is not related to the darkness of the pigment of their skin and you can t choose someone based on their skin color like that to which the chief replied well which one would be more acceptable to the community or is this an accurate reflection of the community so it sounds like he was trying to be you know inclusive but he was just going about it the wrong way i think where he finally wound up in that exchange to the extent that we we rely upon that transcript is is probably where he should have started which is like we need to reflect the community right and i think by the data the police force has some work to do to better reflect the diversity of the community especially given the history of policing issues in the african american community like all laudable important goals right now he just seems really sloppy about how he went about this process and you know your job as a leader of that police department is to build support for your policies and when you can t get that support is to hold people accountable to carry them out and it seems like he just seems like he didn t have like you know his feet on the ground when it comes to just like basic 101 in organizational change here yeah and there s another um allegation that came out out of this investigation where he was standing in front of a wall of like framed photos of uh heads of the office or or high up uh officers and said that wall is too white i m gonna change that in front of people which um which offended a lot of the people that testified against him there were 21 witnesses that all seemed to have unanimously agreed that he s made promotions based on race in their opinion um and they re alleging that the equal employment opportunity commission uh regulations are violated um if th if that s really the metric that he s ultimately using in the end for to choose his promotions but he denies the uh which is blacker comment and also um only six out of his 15 promotions that he s made have been people of like uh minority classes and so you know there s there s both sides to this story here but um ultimately it seems like this allegation um and this investigation was pretty conclusive and he lost his job for it so this is a tricky one for me because on the one hand i don t think you should be looking at candidates based solely off of their race it should be about you know way more than that it should be about what they re capable of but at the same time if you are hired to change the nature of a police department in this time period where things are so tense between the black community and police departments and you like for instance if you looked at a wall of pictures of people who were leaders of the police department he said oh this wall s too white well that s a very off color uh statement uh literally but the the thing is if he really does feel that the police department is not a reflection of the environment that they re policing what s wrong with trying to change that yeah but i think part my feeling is part of changing that also means uh doing everything possible to bring everybody else along now if they still don t come along with you in my opinion then it s on them but it doesn t sound to me like he did enough to convince the people in this department that his criteria were sound and there was this one exchange between him and a guy who was passed up this guy i love the names involved here by the way this is the name malushi right so um melushi goes up to how do we say his name scarado scoroto um and mushi is upset because he was passed up for some job right and he goes up to scrota at this reception and this is a coin in the transcript from this report he goes so you re you re promoting a guy with an internal affairs investigation kicked out of special events ia and scored a write replies that s just where we re at and then malushi goes back i m senior to both an overall time and rank and then scrota replies again that s just where we re at and then melushi goes on to say i thought you were hired to change things there was a culture where there was patronage yada yada yada and then apparently according to some other witness uh the scroto guy walks away from this exchange and goes who s this melushi guy i want to punch him in the face so i don t i don t know what to make of this but like it sounds to me like this guy like if he s gonna be pushing this this police department to reform which is admirable and i do think police departments should reflect the communities they serve uh you ve got to be you know better at this like you can t be so sensitive to people pushing back against your policies you have to take the time be patient explain it to them come up with criteria that you re honest about implement those criteria with fidelity take feedback even if you disagree with the feedback respect the people giving it to you so if this guy is right that this other person had an internal affairs investigation and if that guy is right that there was a history of patronage and issues you need to take the time to be like look this is why this is different this is why that internal affairs investigation uh you know we wound up you know looking past it because nothing came like just spend the time to bring people along you know what i m saying yeah and also people who have been looked over for jobs are never gonna you know speak highly of the person that looked them over for a job so you have to take everything that these individuals are saying with a grain of salt but my question is what do you do then to change that culture because i think he was being way too obvious and transparent with what he was doing and i think he was not doing it i think he was doing it possibly in good faith i m not sure but he wasn t being smart about it um but well you know my i always say this like when we re talking about the supreme court it s like okay well we don t want to choose somebody just because of their race and gender but there s never been a person of this race in general on the supreme court so it s like how else do we get there what what i want to know what the process for getting there is if we don t if we want to just look past someone s immutable characteristics okay how else do we change you know the makeup of these things you know what i think is missing and i don t know um what his policy has been on this but in terms of this report this is about promotion of people that are already in the force and making sure that they re being treated fairly just based on their qualifications but i think that there s definitely an argument to be made about the recruitment process and making sure that we re recruiting from communities that reflect the people who they ultimately will serve and so i think that you know that s one way that you can if you want to make these sort of changes that he was trying to make uh implement that without being offensive to anyone that s already in the force and i mean i i m not gonna make any statement on whether or not i think he was right and doing what he was doing but that s certainly a better way of going about it to say you know let s go and recruit let s go actually reach out to the communities let s let s get new blood into the force that can ultimately be promoted through these channels and not necessarily overlook someone uh regardless of their qualifications based on an immutable characteristic yeah and i think this is tricky i i think you asked the right question which how do you go about this and like you know as i ve previously described my my position on the supreme court stuff is just straight up incoherent so i won t revisit that now because i do think you need to make these changes i think yeah my biggest issue with him is how he communicated and brought people along but i also think there are certain steps you could take along the way right and i don t know these people he picked i don t know if this is the right person you don t have anything because you know what some of these people are saying that oh i i was i was on the job longer i had seniority well that doesn t mean anything yeah you could have been on the job longer and not done as good of a job so we really ultimately don t know they were both tenure and testing metrics that they were talking about in the report um and particularly the one guy with 20 years tenure at the second highest testing metric as well i m not sure what those testing metrics were but those were internal to the force yeah so that s what it means you got to design new criteria right now union rules may prohibit this but maybe you get a panel of people from the community to participate in the interview process right so people who are affected by this right and you know maybe that that in some ways it also takes it out of your hands a little bit so you can able to say all right now we ve like agreed on this thing and yada yada and you one one way he could have gone about this is is one step at a time to be like all right we want to right we do want a police force that represents the community right yes we want a police force that understands the community right because we re pleasing yes all right trail of yes is now so because of that we need to have uh you know we need to bring the community in on this process a little bit yeah that is a hard yes but let s say you get that yes keep going right and then in the end people agree to the process they could still they still can and will have issues with it but they ll have less to hang around your neck you re less likely to lose your job in that scenario and i get it when he looks at that wall and says it s too white like he s probably right uh but the thing is like if you re if your job is to bring along this police department and effectively manage it being right isn t the only criteria for what it means to be effective at that job because now he s right and without a freaking job so that doesn t help anybody and being right you know he can t just look at those individuals and say oh they re white so they re problematic right like you know he doesn t know i mean he s coming into this police department so he doesn t know the individual backstories of all these rights judging them for their skin color is no different from you know what s what s going on in this country for you know hundreds of years but again i understand the sentiment and there was also probably a lot of political pressure to do this because the guy before him was demoted because he defended his officers shooting rubber bullets of peaceful protesters in the light of george ford and so there was probably a lot of political pressure on him to do this and maybe that s the reason why he was going about it in such a poor manner um but yeah i i totally do agree that it should have been done a lot a lot more carefully and you know maybe with some community uh input that definitely does sound like it would have been a better way to go uh but we want to end things with doing a little bit of update we talked a little bit about tick tock and how it was being used to show things that were going on with the war in ukraine and how there was a lot of people getting uh banned from tick tock getting their accounts taken down because they were showing things to ukraine uh me particularly was was banned from tock now tick tock has restored me so i m not going to bat mouth them as much as i was going to but there seems to have been an update here so after russia banned both facebook and twitter tick tock announced that it would block live streaming and uploading of new content in russia amid the kremlin s new law that any fake news that goes against the russian narrative when it comes to this war in ukraine is basically punishable by law you can get up to 15 years in prison in russia now if you broadcast any news that they say goes against um you know their reason for that particular war now tick tock is claiming the reason that they re doing this the reason why they re basically making it where you can t upload new content in russia and you can t view new content in russia they re claiming is to protect their users against that new law that russia has just passed but a lot of people are claiming this is really because china owns tick tock and tick tock is just doing russia s bidding here now it s important to point out that russian tick tockers could use vpn a virtual private network to bypass some of these bands however vpns are greatly restricted in russia and i m sure putin isn t gonna probably implement new laws to make those restrictions even harder given that that s probably the only way someone can circumvent these things but oh just one clarifying question on this so when you say china owns tick tock so it s like a chinese it s a it is a chinese based company right yeah bit dance the company that owns tiktok is a chinese based company got it got it so like and and basically our read on that is like if you fight dance if you re if you re a company operating within those borders then chances are that the government has like a strong you know hold on on your decisions yeah i mean this isn t just affecting tick tock a lot of western media has pulled out of russia cnn a lot of entities like that they re not even doing work in russia anymore because they can t we re given this law so it s kind of a wider scope but it s still in place in ukraine right like uh tick tock yes tick tock is still in place in ukraine and there was uh you know we talked about this too about the russian government asking tik tok to uh at least take down some of the ukraine war videos across the board uh just because of its effect that it would have on uh young people um i ve as a person who uses tick tock a bit i ve seen a lot less of that but i am still seeing people um from ukraine uh posting things about the war so they haven t scrubbed that entirely uh but yeah there was some talk of even getting rid of that but ukraine as of right now still has access to tick tock yeah i mean the history of the tick tock is interesting we ll have to cover it more another time like you know india for example doesn t even allow it yeah within its country because of their relationship with china so yeah um you know we ll keep an eye on this uh trump uh once tried to ban it and yeah it has a very complicated history but uh but yeah so unfortunately you can t watch any tick tocks from russia but you can still watch tick tocks for me so that s that s that ll that ll make up for it uh we want to thank you all for watching and listening make sure to

level in 40 years the u s consumer price index shot up by 7 5 percent last month outrunning wage growth and squeezing budgets all over the country now there are a lot of reasons for that but to hear from some progressive senators like bernie sanders and elizabeth warren there s only one culprit here corporate greed let s unpack what s really going on with the inflation crisis uh robbie there is this narrative that we re seeing on the left that is the corporations rising prices not actual inflation like what you know what s going on here yeah i think like one critical moment in this this narrative about inflation was joe biden before the super bowl did this interview with lester holt and it was incomprehensible uh he you know lester old asks about inflation uh and and i think biden says something like what are you trying to be a wise guy or something like that back in july you said inflation was going to be temporary i think a lot of americans are wondering what your definition of temporary is well you re being a wise guy with me a little bit i understand that s your job and then he goes into an explanation where he s saying well this is what like the nobel laureates and ceos are telling me and all that when can americans expect some relief from this soaring inflation according to nobel laureates 14 of them that contacted me and a number of corporate leaders it s ought to be able to start to taper off as we go through this year and so i think in a way you ve got this vacuum on the left where the president isn t really inserting himself with any clarity and because of that i think the warrens of the world the bernie s the world are stepping in and saying all right um you know there are hammers and and you know everything is a nail in the sense that everything is corporate greed for them and so they re telling their story and their story is resonating because you don t have a president who s telling a competing story and my sense is that uh what they re saying bernie and warren it s possible that corporate greed is a part of inflation and we ll go through the data it certainly does not seem true to me that it is the main driver of inflation right now and we ll go through some of those numbers i m sure but that s that s where i come out on this definitely and i think if you look at the amount of money that we ve been printing over the past couple years in response to covet which of course did start with trump but has continued with buy it in we ve increased the supply of dollars by 40 and so i mean just on a logical basis it s at the same time we have the supply chain issues so we have less goods and more dollars chasing fewer goods like it s inevitable that prices are going to rise and continue to rise but it s interesting like there s been kind of a flip in the narrative originally like in the summer there was a new york times article saying like what was it 179 reasons you shouldn t worry about uh inflation and there were tweets going going around like sarah jong who was formerly at the new york times at bison verge um she said all the stuff you re seeing about inflation in the news is driven by rich people flipping their which is just pretty much the opposite of what s going on right now i mean the more wealthy people tend to have more money in the stock market their assets kind of fluctuate with the value of the dollar versus people who are actually spending their paychecks at the grocery store the ones that are feeling this crunch and it s now the number one issue that people are concerned about at like 27 of people saying it s the number one problem yes there was a poll that ricky s referring to in which uh people were asked what s the what s the main problem facing this nation right now and most of them did say inflation 27 of them said and it was the number one issue there um but the value of the dollar has gone down and there was mass spending during the pandemic and also during the pandemic people bought more stuff like they were sitting at home they were panic buying they were hoarding stuff they were buying stuff off amazon because they were bored so you have lower supply because of the supply chain you know issues of the pandemic and you have higher demand because people are spending more money and they have more money to spend that just sounds like a disaster recipe for inflation yeah the timing was bad because in the beginning the pandemic was actually the opposite no spending so people had money they didn t have anything to spend it on because they couldn t really purchase uh the they couldn t purchase services because you couldn t go to a restaurant you couldn t go to that yoga studio etc they were you know for one of the rare times in american history we were saving more than we were spending and then the timing it all hit the market at the same time and so this is where i think like a lot of people are selling a simple story on this but inflation s driven by a lot of things you know rising demand which is what you just talked about you know we have all this money hitting the market at the same time uh spending rose 12 percent year over year in the week that ended february 5th you have falling supply which is obvious the supply chain issues the labor shortages etc you have increased production costs so material labor costs and then you have profits right and profits are part of that story but they re not the only part of the story and you can compare this pretty easily like to say like all right what is um how much do profits really play into this like robert reich the former labor secretary for clinton had this tweet about starbucks and calling out starbucks because they had record profits and you know i have a couple questions about his tweet number one is like it seems to me like almost every year we have record profits 2020 being an exception right so like it s not unique to me that you have record profits is it frustrating that you have record profits at a time when prices are going up yes but do i think that those record profits are a mere reflection of price gouging that s unique to this situation no like it s not like corporations just discovered greed yesterday yeah i would also have a question which is like people who are listening at home and i don t know what the answer to this is but if you have a local coffee shop down the street from you and you have a starbucks uh i would go and try to figure out like have the prices at your local coffee shop risen uh less high than uh or in less proportion to the starbucks uh first of all that s a supply that s a competition thing most places that have a starbucks probably have other coffee shops so if it s true that starbucks is raising their prices out of whack with the local coffee shop go to the local coffee shop but also if the local coffee shop is raising their prices at the same proportion that starbucks is maybe something other than price gouging is going on unless that local coffee shop is also being excessively greedy so i don t know like i just don t have an answer yet to it i want to be this populist who s like yeah it s the corporations and that s probably good politics so i understand the politics of it yeah but i m just not sure it s what s driving this well raising prices just across the board isn t the smartest thing for most corporations to do because they have competition and that s kind of you know your competition if your competition is lower prices they re going to get uh you know they re going to get the the dollar they re going to get the consumer s dollar well can i say one thing on that before we go to the next thing on the competition front one thing the byte administration did that i do agree with is when asked about this question uh at least in when they re earlier asked about this i don t know what they re saying this week on this but they did focus on the meat industry and that is an industry that to me seems like it does have problems with competition there are four companies that control 85 of meat processing in this country and that s double uh the amount of market consolidation than 20 years ago and so that s serious and to me and and that s an industry that is as unaccountable and uh i think uh lowercase c at least corrupt than anything like trying to get into meat processing trying to get into a meat processing plant in the united states is like harder than getting into fort knox i mean you saw what the beef industry did to oprah i think we need to be uh what d they do to her uh well remember when the whole mad cow disease thing happened and she had a whole expose about on her show the beef industry like threatened her and i tried to come after her so so if the beef industry is listening to this you know i do not endorse what robbie is saying about you i m just kidding i actually want to go back to one of these tweets about these rising prices this there s a tweet from kassam rasheed esquire that talks about all these different chipotle 26 profit increase raising prices starbucks 31 profit increase raising prices mcdonald s 59 profit increase raising prices it s and at the end of this tweet basically says there s not a labor shortage this isn t inflation it s 100 corporate greed what do you say to the liberal person the progressive person who is seeing these ceos are getting paid more money these profit margins are sky high and yet everything is getting more expensive to them it does seem like that s a big part of why things are so so expensive so how do you how do you explain to them that inflation is also a part of the equation without with this evidence sitting there well what i m curious about is this says the profit increase but not the percentage of the raising prices and so when you re holding the figure in your head of oh there s been a seven percent rate of inflation if these prices are being raised beyond seven percent then that s definitely some price gouging going on but you know these these are industries where when everyone s kind of locked down and we haven t been traveling as much and we have more expendable income like people might be more likely to go pick up their lunch at chipotle or grab us coffee at starbucks rather than make something in their keurig like it s i think that there s a potential that there s just more at play based on what how people s consumption is changing so i d be curious to see i i don t know off the top of my head what the rate is that they ve actually raised the prices themselves because if that s out of whack with inflation then that s definitely like some price gouging but i i would be very cautious to say that the fact that our money supply went up by 40 isn t part of what s going on here yeah and you could see that if you compare our experience with europe for example where they have very similar global supply issues that we have and an even worse experience with the oil market because of their their dependence on imports like we have we have way less dependent on imports because we have more domestic supply uh their inflation is less than ours what s the biggest difference well they printed less money than we did to ricky s point um i have another question about this and i i don t like big oils this is weird i m like almost defending big oil but you know john stossel uh you know he pointed out like when you know they talk about in this tweet 60 uh profit increase for big oil and he was like well when oil you know was it was dropping like the price per barrel of oil over the past few years especially at the heart of the pandemic were people saying whoa like these are these are really idealistic generous oil companies now they re cutting their prices for the good like like greed was invented in 2021 of course that s really supply demand thing now i do think i want to be clear i do think it s important to monitor these companies and say um is are the ceos making too much money especially like a lot of cases where ceos are making money but the the bottom line of the company isn t improving so like maybe they re the company s becoming less profitable and the ceo is making more money et cetera but what s interesting is here is like um that s not necessarily the argument that i m seeing but also like there there is a shareholder effect in a lot of these companies a lot of these aren t like facebook style companies where where there s these preferred shares and you can t hold mark zuckerberg accountable a lot of these are companies where you have people like warren buffett and huge institutions pension funds who own huge parts of these shares and there is a certain disappointing effect where if you re if you re spending too much money on compensation at the top end year over year over year and not improving your business then there is a certain discipline of the market now that doesn t necessarily mean it it goes down to the customer and and that s why i think there needs to be certain reforms and i think warren i don t love all the reforms that she proposes but i do think that if there are sensible ways that aren t too bureaucratic to to incentivize companies to pay people for performance i m for that but i also think the market can instill a lot of that discipline too and it s interesting nick gillespie for a reason um did a video recently about how elizabeth warren and this kind of new uh rising group in the left that s saying that this is corporate greed sounds a whole lot like gerald ford of all people who did with inflation now was his uh policy back in the day where he put a lot of pressure on corporations to keep the costs down or keep prices down and like in incentivized consumers to never pay above what like the prior market price has been and like even the washington post has like a super long article on how that s completely disastrous and when you try to manipulate the markets in that way it backfires so it s an interesting historical parallel between the two of them yeah i m like i m hesitant to do too many price controls there s like a horrible history of them outside of things that are like life saving medicines and things like that like they re there i think the government has an obligation if they re and then if they re going to do price controls they need to mean they have to ensure that there s adequate supply so a good example is like insulin is too expensive and i think that we should be lowering the cost of insulin but we also should make sure that the government takes on the responsibility of monitoring us to make sure that the supply is there uh and i think that s totally something the government can do but that this gets to my theory of government don t do that to too many different things because i don t think the government has the ability to maintain adequate supply of too many things in the market the market s volatile cryptocurrency is volatile um savings don t pay like so like if you re a conservative like hey i ve been put you know putting money away for a rainy day like you re losing money every day that you keep your money in a savings account and so and the houses are so expensive it s like where do you put your money right now like under your mattress music applause music you,"stock,big

debate a show for political eclectics i m robbie gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlatt well corey what do we have today a lot of interesting things to talk about today leaked documents from the botched afghanistan pull out don t paint the biden administration in a good light we discussed the implications then the debate about the permanent child tax credit continues in washington we look into the pros and cons of that policy new meta analysis from a group of economists suggest the most divisive covet 19 measures lockdowns were not effective at preventing significant death we dive into that research but first things first a lot of fires going off in the nfl right now former miami dolphins head coach brian flores has accused his former team and the entire nfl of a culture of racial discrimination allegations of sham interviews and payoffs to lose games are among the most explosive claims flores makes in his class action lawsuit now racism in the nfl has been an open secret for a while now right now just one of the nfl s 32 teams has a blackhead coach while 70 of the league is black flores is just 40 years old so he s putting his entire career on the line to call this out ravi i know me and you we read this entire lawsuit uh this entire complaint what can we make of all of this yeah we were reading through this yesterday as it came down it reads almost like a history of the nfl and it goes beyond anything that s happened recently and goes all the way to the founding of the nfl and catalogs a history of racism and discrimination that seems undisputed in many ways like there are certain things in this document that are absolutely allegations that have yet to be proven and then there are things that are just historical facts and i think one thing that s fascinating is a lot of people who are just casual sports fans can describe uh what happened in baseball like the negro league and how there were all these amazing players who were deprived a chance but they don t really know that history of the nfl and i think this lawsuit is going to help people understand that history and the nfl if i were the nfl i d be very concerned and flores in this lawsuit he starts out just coming in hot right away this is from the right at the beginning of this complaint document he says in certain critical ways the nfl is racially segregated and is managed much like a plantation it s 32 owners none of whom are black profits substantially from the labor of nfl players 70 percent of whom are black the owners watch the games from atop in nfl stadiums in their luxury boxes while their majority black workforce put their bodies on the line every sunday taking vicious hits and suffering debilitating injuries to their bodies and their brains while the nfl and their owners reap billions of dollars so he s going at them full frontal and i think what makes this interesting is that flores is undisputably a great coach as somebody who s a buffalo bills fan we re in the same division uh when he was fired i tweeted before this lawsuit how and i don t really tweet about the miami dolphins very often or ever but i tweeted that this was a crazy firing because he s a really good coach i mean it s great for the bills that we don t have in division anymore but it was baffling then and now he makes a lot of allegations about what exactly was going on behind the scenes and if i were the nfl i d be concerned yeah definitely and one thing that i m confused about that i m wondering if either of you guys have any insight into um is that the situation in terms of minority hiring seems to be getting worse in recent years um just going back to like 2017 or 2007 to 2011 26 9 of uh head coach hires were of minorities and now that s gone down significantly do we have any sort of sense of why that might be happening well a lot of that just deals with the racial discrimination that he alleges in this lawsuit he talks about the fact that a lot of blackhead coaches are not given the same opportunities as far as leeway like if they have a bad season they often get fired a lot more a lot easier than someone who had who s white who had a bad season uh there was an example of uh i believe it was um jim codwell yeah with the colts uh he went to the super bowl and then two seasons later had a pretty bad season and was just fired and so there s a lot of examples like that there s other examples of the texans head coach was just let go after a pretty bad season uh and i think he was only there for one season wasn t he yeah yeah yeah and i think i i don t know the answer as to why it s getting worse i think there s a lot of attention on this rule called the rooney rule which uh this was a rule that was instituted in 2003 and it seems to be a born of good intentions like johnny cochran was involved and there was this you know there was there was a lot of attention on the fact that at the time there had only been six black head coaches uh by 2003 and they instituted this role that started with a requirement that every time there s a head coaching vacancy you have to interview at least one black person for that position and now it s expanded now you have to interview two people of color they have to be external candidates there s a whole process that the league has set up where they actually help organize the process and it s now trickle down to assistant positions gm positions front office positions and as you point out we are not in a good place even after all that you have one black head coach currently in the nfl at least as of this taping there could be somebody announced in the next few hours and they in this lawsuit uh call out the rooney rule so they re basically saying this very you know maybe a well intentioned rule actually is playing out in ways that are discriminatory right now and and harmful they say that the rooney rule is uh not working because management is not doing the interviews in good faith and therefore it creates a stigma that interviews of black candidates are only being done to comply with the rooney rule rather than in recognition of their talents so uh and they give examples saying you know there are lots of situations that he s alleging and other people are coming forward to share their examples of where there s a vacancy they re called in to do these interviews and the decisions already been made but they re only doing it because it s the rule so they re wasting these time their time and i think what s getting floor is incensed is that he s being called into one interview after another where he s not even being considered for the position but they re doing it just to comply with this rule so it s kind of this classic good intentions gone wrong situation and there s one colorful example where john elway you know the hall of fame uh quarterback who s now the gm or now president i think of the broncos showed up late to this interview seemed like he was hungover clearly didn t give a __ and i think he s i think flores had a lot of these uh you know experiences and then he just lost his __ well let s talk about maybe the reason why he lost his __ and that s the bill belichick text i mean what do you make of this from what it looks like bill belichick texted uh flores saying you re kind of almost congratulating him for getting this for potentially getting the head coaching position that was open to the new york giants and then uh flores had not yet gone to his second interview yeah with the giants and then it seems like belichick takes it the wrong yeah this is like a who s on first situation so if you don t know football bear with me here bill belichick great one of the greatest if not the best head coach of all time which means that he has a coaching tree they call it meaning like a lot of these candidates come from him because he s trained them you know think of him almost as like a steve jobs or something you know where there s a lot of his proteges going to start new companies uh he happened to have two proteges named brian one brian dayball who s the was the former offensive coordinator of the buffalo bills and then he had brian flores uh who we ve been talking about here brian dabal gets the giants job but it s still not public yet brian flores is still interviewing for the giants job bill belichick texts and it seems uh he texted brian flores thinking it was brian dabal saying congratulations on the job and flourish is like wait what and then bill bill belichick had to basically apologize and that s the beginning of the complaint is that text message uh and i think and the reason why they share it i think this is not obvious to people trying to think about this from a legal perspective the reason why they share that text is because it they re offering this as proof that the decision was made before flores wrapped up the interview process and that is that is significant from a legal perspective because the weird intersection of this rooney rule means that race is explicitly a factor in who gets to interview right like because they have to interview uh people of color for these positions uh but uh if you re if it s if you have to interview a person for of color for a position but you ve already made up your mind about who that person is before they come in that means that you re basically offering up people of color as like a sacrifice to the gods of equity and diversity or whatever uh which means that you re bringing people in especially to not give them a job because of their race yeah that s and it s a it s a tricky complicated legal argument but here just as from a legal perspective as somebody who s been a part of a couple of big lawsuits like this nothing that will play out in the dollar figures of this but i ve been a part of at least one multi million dollar lawsuit the discovery is what the nfl is going to be afraid of here it s not going to be the ultimate outcome i think this is going to be a six fig as a massive multi million dollar hundreds of million dollars if not billions dollar settlement but uh the reason why the nfl is going to be really concerned here is because now everybody mentioned in this document is going to be subject to depositions and there are some things in here that are super inconvenient for the nfl uh one one thing you know beyond the race questions which there are just some damning damning allegations in here uh in here and i know corey you did take talk about that this morning uh one piece outside of the race context but it does have a racial component is that the the owner of the dolphins who stephen ross who also owns related companies anybody who s a member of equinox that s the company owns equinox uh steven ross allegedly asked flores to tank games like lose games on purpose and was trying to give flores a bonus to do that and the reason why is because in the nfl the team with the lowest record gets the top draft pick the next year and flores refused and so if that s true that s like goes to the integrity of the game so uh the nfl is not going to want that to come out and so i think this is where the nfl is right now i think that they re in really big trouble here they re not going to want to go to discovery they re going to do everything possible to settle this case and the question is what does flores want like what from a dollar figure what what s what suffices who else joins this class action lawsuit and then he lists a couple remedies to the hiring process uh as well which i think the nfl will probably quickly grant just because i think for them the dollars and cents are a bigger concern i mean it s sad to say this but i thought the nfl would be more concerned about the fixing games than all of the racial discrimination because that ruins like you said the entire integrity of the league now some people are going to look at this story and they re going to say well you should hire the best person for the job you shouldn t have anything to do with skin color so what do you say to someone who comes with that attitude and does and doesn t see the relevancy here of the sham interviews and everything like that and just thinks that flores is blowing this out of proportion so i want to i want to live in a world where people s immutable characteristics don t matter in a job interview the problem is i don t get to create a world where everybody s on an equal playing field right away so when you have a situation where only one of 32 nfl coaches are black that s not an accidental situation if you re flipping a coin 32 times in a row and it comes up tails 31 out of 32 times that means that something more than chance is going on here and that there s not an equal playing field and so from my perspective as we talked about in the supreme court situation i don t like litmus tests um i don t think it s it s great for our country that we have them but at the same time the absence of taking race into account when race has been taken into account for hundreds of years means that in a way you you are acceding to the history right like in this situation where you know the owners are like is there a black owner i don t think there is a black owner right is that an accident right so like when you when you have a situation that s so stacked against a group of people and um and and you have to remedy it somehow right and like is the remedy just to do nothing and hope that it all plays out and and becomes equal one day or do you do things to actually put your finger on the scale to fix those things i think that s what makes makes this tricky is because attempts to fix it like the rooney rule can sometimes backfire uh sometimes if you pick somebody because of their race then you know they feel like they re not legitimate because you know you ve announced that ahead of time we talked about the supreme court but then if you don t pick them at all then they don t have an opportunity at all so you re kind of in this catch 22 and this is where i get to people this is where i get upset with certain people who called this out like matt walsh tweeted the following he said this is pretty great the nfl put an affirmative action policy in place requiring teams to interview black coaching candidates just to check the box the giants followed the rule and now a black coach is suing them claiming that the policy is somehow racist against him amazing now i agree that this rooney rule backfired but what i would want to know to matt walsh citizen is what are you gonna do like when we live in a world where we showed the supreme court stats the other day you could talk about any aspect of american life whether it s wealth who are the ceos who are in the halls of power who are the head coaching candidates who are the gm s who are the owners it is overwhelmingly tilted in favor of one race in this country a country that happens to have a deep history with slavery like is this an accident no so what are you going to do matt wall citizen we can agree that the rooney will backfire but what are you going to do to help fix this problem is my question you know when i hear stuff like the matt walsh tweet it s just it s just infuriating because no one like brian flores i don t want to speak for all african americans we re not a monolith but no one like brian flores is going to put his career on the line like that unless he really felt like enough was enough yeah he had a future yeah i absolutely absolutely still had a future i mean there are still some open positions right now that he could be considered for but he probably won t be because of because of his lawsuit and like when you re in that position when you re an african american and you re in a professional position you never want to think oh i m not getting promoted because of my race you never want to think that but when you have the qualifications and you see someone else getting promoted who doesn t quite have the qualifications or your qualifications are equal you have to think to yourself what else could it be and i think that s the position that flores is in here yeah i would just want to know like if we just stopped all race based uh discrimination hiring practices everything like we don t we don t have affirmative action so we don t have the remedies but we also don t have this discrimination how long does it take for races to become on equal footing and i think that is a question that divides people ideologically i actually think there s a good faith discussion amongst people as to like how that would play out the problem is like you need a lot of things to happen before that we live in that world there s one other thing to point out here which is the nfl on the day that this uh this um complaint was filed immediately put out a statement saying that this was without merit i find that interesting because there s a lot in this document uh and there s no way they could have known it was without merit like for take example the stephen ross allegation how does the nfl know within an hour or whatever of this complaint coming out that stephen ross didn t have a uh a a an incentive for people to tank games like so it calls this into question and um i and i m not completely sure if this is true or not but i heard peter king on the radio this morning or yesterday saying that when there was a st louis lawsuit um where it s the city of st louis sued the nfl over stadium relocation when they moved to la the nfl also called that uh without merit or something equivalent immediately and then guess what eventually uh settled for hundreds of millions of dollars so i think the fact that they say it s without merit almost tells us nothing about whether there is merit in this case there s two interesting things to note um one that flores lawyers i don t think they ve named two but have said that on both the charges of having sham interviews and on being paid to lose games that there are other coaches that have said that they ve had the same experiences and another interesting thing is that like the nba doesn t have this degree of disparity in their coaching and stuff so there maybe there s something specifically happening within the nfl and and there s a model of another league where that s not the same situation but i ve definitely been on the sidelines on this conversation well there s a theory about the nfl is like the theory about the nfl is that and this is bill simmons i ve heard i m not sure if he s the original proponent of this theory but he says that you know nba is more new money like kind of people who are younger and they re kind of more tech innovators and stuff like that so there are people who think a little bit differently than a lot of the old money that s in the nfl that s at least a theory about what what makes the two leagues differently and then the second is that the nf the nba is way more uh empowering to players because when you have five players on the court at a time and they re not wearing helmets they re way more recognizable symbols each player matters more so like a lebron james or you know god help us to kyrie irvings of the world have more power and control over their destiny and the league s destiny and so like when something happens they can like you know what happened during um the floyd protests they can grind a game to the to halt with with a little bit of coordination between players who who know each other coordinate with each other and that s largely a good thing and so they demand certain things and lebron james is an example like i think he was instrumental in ty lue becoming his coach for example and you see this time and time again is that they have way more decision making power over who becomes their coach and you don t see that much as much in the nfl well hopefully some things in the nfl will change we re going to move on to our next story here new revelations about the u s withdrawal from afghanistan paint the biden administration as woefully unprepared axios shared leaked white house documents this week that suggests even basic details of the operation were still being decided just hours before the taliban seized the afghan capital fast forward to now and the humanitarian crisis everyone warned about is coming true the u n now says more than half of the population there somewhere on the order of 20 million people face extreme hunger millions are fleeing sounding alarms about a migrant crisis so any way you look at this even if you agree with the withdrawal this hasn t gone well at all what do we make of the the fallout here from this afghanistan debacle that s still still happening months later i mean this war is singular you know you think about the fact that you know i was a freshman in college when 9 11 happened and my brother went off and fought in afghanistan and i have a bunch of friends who went out and fought there and then i lived long enough to then go on and start a school where my kids were old enough to graduate and fight in afghanistan and that s crazy and so this war has been going a long time i was a fly on the wall back in 2009 and 10 working in the obama administration when there was a big surge debate and all of that and man it felt like we were rounding the bend back then but obviously this continues to go on and i think the sins are so numerous it s unbelievable so you start the clock back in the 80s when we re arming the mujahideen against russia we basically did nothing to contain the consequences of that after we and russia left uh and they basically assassinated their leader taliban came to power uh and then we then jump in full force after 9 11 and then i immediately basically within a year go to war in iraq and that becomes our central focus and we take our eye off the ball in afghanistan and then once we realize we re screwing things up in afghanistan we then apply a nation building the clear whole build strategy from iraq to afghanistan without really a full accounting of the differences of the two countries you know one country being for all of the flaws to say lightly under saddam hussein it was still a bureaucratic state with way higher literacy rates and had a history of infrastructure and government functioning in its own crazy saddam way afghanistan was never that it had none of that infrastructure it had super high illiteracy rates and was basically a collection of different warlords controlling different parts of the country with a huge pakistani influence on its border and so we screwed that part up and then there s so many other things but then you have this 2019 piece deal that trump pushed with the taliban which basically gave the taliban a clear sense of the clock that they needed to wait to run out so that they could take back power then biden comes in announcing 9 11 as the date which is like sure like that that s like a random date right like uh he picks it for symbolic reasons not strategic and tactical reasons and then doesn t put in the time resources attention to make that work um and then uh i think the seeds to the demands of president ghani who basically didn t want the u s to start evacuating people early because they didn t want to create a sense of chaos we over uh we were overconfident in the afghan government and the afghan army uh and then biden completely screws up the the evacuations and then gives a speech in august uh basically saying the buck doesn t stop here like was not very clear about what he would have done differently the mistakes he made etc and this is where we find ourselves it s like one mistake after another and biden is the commander in chief the buck stops with him and he was the most recent fuck up in a long series of fuck ups that our country s had uh in afghanistan yeah and i think the humanitarian side of this is hugely important because now half of people in the country are experiencing extreme levels of hunger hundreds of thousands are fleeing we love translators and aids and americans there women and girls all their rights essentially are being rolled back slowly it s really tragic and i hope especially as a libertarian that this is kind of the nail in the coffin of this idea that we can go go and get ourselves involved in some very complex situation and fix it and somehow like evangelize our model of of democracy or life somewhere else and um this reminds me of a friend of mine faisal who started this organization called ideas beyond borders he s from iraq he grew up reading classical liberal attacks and very like the american constitution and john stewart mill and now he s sending books to afghanistan to actually teach people these values because you can t just go have a military presence in a country and then pull out and expect that somehow our our values are going to uphold afterwards and so i think that that issue of education and assuming that the american model can be extrapolated all around the world is just completely broken and we have a really grotesque history of covert action and getting involved in all these different conflicts that we really have no business being in and i hope that this really changes the the national mores around doing something like this again in the future absolutely you made some great points there um about educating another country about democracy before you just try to force it on to them but something you said uh ravi about the fact that we were over confident in the ability of the afghanistan government to hold back the taliban and not everybody was there was a general frank mckenzie he was critical of this uh doa agreement that uh trump did with the taliban did not think that was a really good plan and was also very critical of biden s assessment that the afghanistan government would be able to hold for as long as it was or for as long as they thought it would be so there were people uh in the u s military at very high levels that were critical of both of the actions of these presidents and it seems like this was an instance in which the political civilian leaders of our government weren t listening to the people on the ground as much as they should have been and that may have resulted in why this was such a horrible blunder for the bad administration yeah this is a textbook case for me as to why i like my government to take on a limited amount of things and do them really well because if you look at what the bite administration was doing in their initial days it s like you ve got covid going on they re passing all these bills on the hill they re trying to expand this expand that make this promise make that promise and in the end you can t do all these things and i think this is this is where i differ from a lot of alternative media where like there s a lot of you know some of our friends in alternative media which there s not an issue they don t find a conspiracy in it s like you know ukraine is a military industrial complex and this and that like having served in government it s more like the keystone cops a lot of times it s not like there s this group this cabal sometimes there is like but uh it s not always this like this you know this villain you know petting their cat in some you know dark castle somewhere like it s often just a group of people who are overwhelmed not coordinating well not on the same page and making huge mistakes and then not owning up to them which is what i see here and uh and it s really sad to me like this is this is a group of people who depended upon us and no matter what we think about the origins of that war or going all the way back to the 80s like these are human beings who are suffering and and i there s got to be more we could do even today yeah i listened to an interview of a um soldier who was deployed to afghanistan who broke down in tears talking about when he was talking to these translators on the ground when they were involved in the war he was saying like like we re here for you like you re we re gonna pay you back for your help and to think now that those people are left and now entirely endangered and enemy territory for having helped our country is just so tragic i think we can agree this is quite frankly the biggest mistake of the baton administration so far so political implications here i mean not not as many people are talking about this as much i know this axios article is what brought it up for us to talk about but is this something that going forward midterms 2024 is this something that biden will have to answer for when it comes to the politics of all of this yeah i think if you look at his polling over the summer this was one very critical piece of a large slide that he took over the summer obviously kovid was part of it there are a lot of things that were part of it and uh you know he deserves criticism for this like i i ve definitely laid out the blame to a lot of people but during the trump administration i was very critical administration for not you know owning uh the results of their own policy and constantly passing the buck and doing what about isms or whatever and i think democrats and liberals need to do that with biden he is the person in charge and he had the ability even after he made those mistakes to get up and give a very different speech on august 31st over the summer and he did not and i remember that there was this viral video that went around by jocko willink um you know the the veteran who s now like a public intellectual who s written a lot of interesting books and he basically gave this alternative biden speech where he was basically saying like this is what it would sound like to take responsibility now i don t agree with everything that jocko said because i think in there he was like i m going to hunt down everybody who does yadda yadda and i m like you can t really follow through on that now like there s not an appetite to send more american troops down there to keep fighting that war but i did like the first part which is essentially i __ this up and i like leaders who were just do what bill belichick did in his text message be like yeah i __ up like you know like yeah but yeah should have sent a text message to uh like uh the president uh ghani karzai he could send the wrong president to the wrong president yeah i mean i can t fix it anymore uh impeachment do we think i m gonna get beats over this you don t think i mean no matter what but you remember the threshold for impeachment is so high you know is it though well to impeach to remove sorry oh yeah well when it comes to removal yeah but i mean if the republicans took the house and the senate would that be on the table i think it would be i don t know if this would be it it may maybe some like hunter biden laptop conspiracy or something but who knows now on to the continued debate about the child tax credit democrats say the credit which expired in december of 2021 reduced child poverty by 30 but republicans are pushing back saying the program amounts to a new welfare program the price tag on the tax credit law is hefty around 185 billion dollars a year and those numbers don t sit well with the fact that the u s has just surpassed 30 trillion dollars in our national debt for the first time ever so let s dive into this is the tax child credit or is the child tax credit i should say something worth saving uh ravi i know you have some strong opinions about the child tax credit and i me and my son would like to hear those well okay just for people like me who don t have children this is a tax benefit that s granted to americans uh for each qualifying dependent child right and uh what s interesting is that it s fluctuated in terms of who qualifies over the past few years there s been a lot of debate about this it started in 1997 actually as a republican idea uh and has now um and that was for those people who weren t around back then there was this big debate about welfare and work requirements for welfare and you had republicans who favored you know tax incentives because it s people who are working and that and they wanted to incentivize people working in reward people are working putting that debate aside this tax credit has fluctuated in terms of how much money you can make and still qualify for it and for me and this is at the center of the debate between mansion and bennett manchin wants to make this uh low i think 75 000 qualifying for a family and bennett wants to the whole household i think right yeah 75 for the whole household for families so the so this is where i come down on this is that number one i think our tax code in general is too complicated i think that it s right now like every one policy sounds sensible but then when you build it all on top of each other it s like one of those houses that if you ve ever been somewhere where like you build a little piece at a time nothing matches each other and nothing makes sense nothing works i would also say that it is a weird system where you have people you have a world where potentially a 50 000 a teacher making 50 dollars uh is subsidizing uh a family making three hundred ninety nine thousand dollars uh for anything in my opinion and so uh whether they have kids or not that just seems like a bad public policy result and so to me uh i want children and poverty to be taken care of i think there are many different ways you could do that i think that the way that this has been designed has um just leads to some really weird results yeah i think it s worth noting that historically this has been a republican uh kind of policy and a democratic policy and i i don t personally have any problem with it i don t really like taxes in the first place as a libertarian and so in any way that i can put money back into people s pockets to actually spend as they please rather than through government programs that end up you only getting getting cents on the dollar by the time the money actually reaches the person through different uh and like handout systems um i mean i m i m for the child tax credit i don t know about this specific iteration but i also just more largely feel that our tax system is so convoluted and bureaucratic and ridiculous i mean it s it s millions of words long there s literally 1 7 billion hours spent by americans every single year trying to figure out what the heck they owe 31 billion dollars spent just to figure it out to pay other people to do it this is from 2019 and if you take in the cost of compliance plus the work hours that are lost in the economy a george mason university study estimated 600 billion dollars loss which is insane um and there s also a study that s worth mentioning that s kind of funny um money money magazine sent a fictional family s tax information to 46 different tax experts that were considered really like high end accountants and they got back 46 different estimates with thousands of dollars difference between and so i m i m gonna say i m a flat taxer uh flat rate on this on this personally um because i think that our system is just so broken and convoluted and we just add more and more provisions and layers and it s just more and more confusing so you re saying people are actually losing hours of their life hours that they could be working by just doing their oh 100 i mean it s it s so ridiculous and so confusing and especially if you live in a place that adds even more layers on the local level it s insane we we spend 1 7 billion hours as a country trying to figure out what the heck we owe that s insane and that s unpaid we re paying this money to to the government and we re doing a job for them it s stealing our time so taxation really is death taxation impact i will stand by that one cory also like uh you know to answer your question about my message for your child uh the let s focus on what you said about the the deficit 30 trillion the 30 trillion dollar deficit and i was looking at this because the the the federal reserve is talking about raising interest rates right which means that um the amount that the u s actually has to pay out and our debt will go up there are estimates from the congressional budget office that net costs will reach 8 6 of gross domestic product of just uh our debt and our interest rate on our debt um to the point where we ll have 60 trillion in interest rate payments over the next three decades so essentially i just don t want him to pay for our decisions today you know i want him to have that money in his pocket um but more important than that like we re we re borrowing from future generations here now now this isn t where i would start this debate like i actually if i m rank ordering good policy versus bad i would probably go after things like mortgage interest rate deductions on yachts which is currently a policy uh and so there s so many bad tax deductions and i think this is my problem with the tax code where i m with ricky is like the more wealthy you are and i think especially once you start to hit the hundreds of thousands of dollars like 500 000 plus you start doing all these tricks so you re not paying as much taxes as you should we ve all seen the numbers but i also think and this is where i m going to be really unpopular and to be clear i want to have kids i want to get married but i do want to look out for my single people out there who don t want to have kids they get absolutely screwed in the tax code so here s just a couple of examples of where single unmarried people who don t have kids and don t plan to get them just get absolutely screwed so uh first of all they don t get any tax breaks couples uh get to jointly file and they get deductibles um social security goes back into the system after you die if you re a single person whereas it goes to your spouse if you re married if you re married you can claim your spouse s social security at 65 and then wait for yours to accrue uh married couples can put two people on an ira whereas if one spouse does not work for five years the other spouse can make contributions into that account but if you re a single person and you don t work for a few years i can t my family they re not allowed to contribute uh into my 401k or my my ira spouses can withdraw from an ira for medical and educational purposes and not face a 10 penalty but single people face a 10 fee and that s before we even get to kids right we re talking about the the child tax credit uh the fact that you know single people pay to the public school system which they should but like thank you single people for doing that we don t they don t get that enough and then you have parental leave policies in companies you put this all together and say wow like being a single person is freaking hard like and all i have to hear is how hard it is to raise children in this country uh and so you know i just want a little bit more respect for my single people out there i think every single person if we did something like the child tax credit as a child will benefit from their family having more money even if they eventually become a single person well yeah in order to be a person i think you have to have i don t know i guess i m not i m not feeling as bad for you as you are but you know let me give you some things okay so first of all on average if your child does not latch on mines didn t a hundred and eighty dollars per month for formula and that s in alabama it s about two hundred and forty three dollars a month you know what my equinox membership is uh uh 240 a month for formula in new york 70 to 80 a month for diapers um 25 to 300 a month for toys pacifiers and other child related __ it is very expensive to take care of just a little person like a toddler like a little child then when they grow up they have golf lessons and tennis lessons and baseball lessons and t ball lessons you have to pay for all of that stuff then they become teenagers and then they get a driver s license then you have to pay for their car like it is extremely exciting hear you and it lasts for 18 years but then with my generation it lasts for 30 years because we don t move out of our parents houses until we re at least 31 or 32 so i m sorry i just don t sympathize as much with the single person argument because it is way more expensive to actually take care of a human being so here s my thing on that though uh and we ve got our producer lucy back there who s about to bring a child into the world and and here s my thing you know lucy just bought a nice car a grand cherokee uh and and here s here s the thing hold on hold on uh when we re talking about thresholds like four hundred thousand dollars like i don t wanna subsidize her like upgrading to a denali you know what i m saying like like yes i want you to have money for all those things uh but i think when people start getting up to three four hundred thousand dollars yeah of course like that s absurd to me this should definitely be a cap i mean i don t know if 70 000 should be that cap but there should definitely be a cap but i think you know when you look at what other countries do other more developed countries in europe and how much they spend on child care it s insane i mean the the facts really speak for themselves yeah there s that spain situation um from our research that i found really fascinating is that you had from 2007 to 2010 spain introduced and then eliminated cash transfers to new mothers so this wasn t a tax credit and the data is really interesting we have an underpopulation crisis potentially in this country many people say uh and the data at least suggests that this cash transfer system actually incentivized new births it actually decreased abortions in the country and then when they cancelled it um births went down uh and so it is definitely one if i m being serious and kind of take off my skip bayless defend a position hat here for a second and say all right this could be if we if we did better in taking care of parents in this country especially on the lower end of the income scale that could help us uh with the sort of demographic time bomb that we have i would want to marry it with smart immigration policy because i think that you know births are isn t the only way out of this but yeah like i if i m being serious um which i still am single people i m still your advocate but uh i do think that this is a tool in toolbox norway spends 29 000 a year on toddlers iceland 24 dollars a year chile spends eight thousand dollars a year chile yeah is that how you pronounce it i m not gonna say chili um um i think it s chile uh eight thousand dollars a year lithuania eight thousand dollars a year we spend five hundred dollars a year on toddlers in the united states yeah but have you have you looked at how much we pay per pupil here in new york for education of a child that s new york it s like six zillion dollars per child here i would much rather see a system where we give tax credits and allow the parents to spend that money however they want and however they see fit for their family rather than the government doling it out and with programs that sometimes aren t effective which i know we re about to talk about one of those very programs with pre k so let s talk a little bit about that new research finds that pre k programs could be detrimental to children the study published found that children who attended state sponsored pre k were 74 more likely to be diagnosed with a learning disorder by sixth grade compared to their peers who did not attend pre k that s pretty scary let s talk a little bit about these findings what is wrong with the pre k system here in america well this is coming out of tennessee s system it s a vanderbilt study and they held the study back for two years just to double check it because the findings were so crazy um but the kids that literally did not go to pre k at all did so much better it s almost double the learning disorder difference and also school rule violations it was 18 5 for the control group versus 27 3 percent for the group that was actually kept in pre k but initially when they went into kindergarten they were doing better the kids that had gone to pre k and then this flipped as they got older their development was just off and not as as favorable as the kids that were literally at home which is just really incredible and this is the first study of this kind where we have a control group that didn t do anything at all and it s pretty astonishing so they were when they went to pre k and they went to kindergarten they were doing better in kindergarten first they were doing better but then as they got older they started developing these issues yeah so i mean my take on this is that what happened was they were being taught like early kindergarten stuff and so when you get to the first fundamental things like you re gonna have a little bit of a head start but they lacked the experience of just being at home being a kid going out and exploring and i think in a lot of these pre k settings they re just sitting around quiet being yelled at not really allowed to get their energy out and just enjoy or bond with a parent or play with siblings outside and so i think this is not a good look for this governmental pre k situation yeah and i think the fact that this is tennessee is notable because it s obviously where i ran schools and gee i didn t know that i ll give you and i think like let me paint you a picture of what this looks like i think this is a question of pre people act like pre k is some solution to the larger system that stands outside of it but it s going to be a reflection of the same problems that the system already had and so just to give you a sense uh we have a a guy named elias lukes who works for us and he was the first student ever attended the first school i ever started and when i went to go visit the middle school when i was just scouting locations to start our first school when i went to go visit the middle school that elias would have gone to i was with my buddy john little who s now on the school board for nashville we went to go visit that middle school and it was like an episode of cobra kai there were like fights breaking out all over the school wow no adult supervision anywhere you could find it i go up to the second floor uh to visit the teacher who had arranged the visit and she s got a bunch of kids watching cartoons in the middle of the day in the middle of a school year and this is middle school and so uh if that s what middle school looks like there s why why should pre k be any different for kids like and obviously quality is variable and generally speaking as we talked about here like having kids in a school building i want that over kids not being in school building which is why even with this data i still want to keep trying to make pre k better i wouldn t want to get rid of it but my critique is of of people who just want more and more and more without saying how do we make the stuff that we have better what are the difficult choices we need to make to make kindergarten better first grade better second grade and i think what s interesting here is if this were just test scores they would have argued away i know the people who they would just be like all right that s an imperfect measure but because this includes so many other things including special education services you know and which is notable because you d expect that if kids start earlier you d expect to have fewer kids on ieps individualized education programs because they would be able to get ahead of certain deficits and the fact that that didn t happen in this case is notable and this is there there s been data like this going back a long time so there was a government study on head start in 1965 that found that the program produced no discernible advantage in elementary school performance and i don t want to use this data to say let s not provide programs for kids because i think that s a really bad response to this problem but i do want to challenge people who are responsible for the system to say if you want to expand you need to show us what s different about this than what is already happening yeah i know biden is really pushing it hard for the buildback better build to have this universal pre k i know it s a huge thing the democrats are pushing but like you said if k 12 is broken why introducing people to that at an earlier age how would that fix the problem and something ricky said really points out to me about the idea of taking a child that young and putting them in a controlled environment like that telling them to sit down and shut up i i have a toddler right now and they don t like to sit down and they don t like to shut up and you really can t make them honestly and so i do i can definitely see some developmental issues coming from in stealing that on a child too young i could definitely see the backlash there yeah and this is where i m with ricky on loosening up a little bit in certain cases like like what if we just piloted vouchers more for pre k and in some places this is true and it could be even true that and i don t know enough about how tennessee implemented this but this is where i would want to to do what we do and i know that like this is the this is the ravi bingo card i ve talked about being a school principal let s talk about charter schools because that s what everything s about everything comes back to that card but one of the reasons why i like the process for creating charges is that you have people who have to make a case to a city in our case it was five years every five years we get a charter to to to produce education for kids i would love to open up this process to make it more competitive and there s probably elements of this already in place in this pre k program to say all right innovators come out there we re going to pay you really well like come up with new theories about how to get kids a good experience in pre k make it really worth their while and i think that could help yeah and i think this is really a perfectly timed study to come out because we need to know this before we make some sort of sweeping policy that we have universal pre k and it s really important that we look at this data and we say okay well our public school systems have all these issues that have kind of piled up over time with unions and this and that and all the bureaucratic layers that you have to go through to accomplish anything and this is a new program that we re setting up and we need to make sure that we don t make those same mistakes and i think this is a moment for opportunity absolutely did we did did we all go to pre k here yeah mm hmm i went to pregame too yeah i didn t do well after it either i remember making us do these menial little things like punching holes with thumbtacks into this piece of paper and i d get like poked in the finger every two seconds like it was just doing stupid stuff and i would have been better kind of tottering around outside and like doing something different okay i had a great experience yeah i used to get hit with rulers in pre k i didn t i didn t care what yeah well you know you ll tap on the hand south man now on to our final story one of our favorite topics to talk about here covid lockdowns a study co authored by an economist at john hopkins university found that covet 19 lockdowns may not have been as effective at reducing the covet 19 mortality rate as we once thought according to the report during the first covert 19 wave in the spring of 2020 lockdowns only reduced coveted mortality by 0 2 percent in the united states and europe now the study they conducted is considered a meta analysis which means they assessed a whole bunch of previous studies in order to develop a single conclusion about whether or not lockdowns were effective and based on those 24 studies they boiled their research down to the authors concluded that stay at home orders were by and large ill founded policy now ricky i think it s fair to say that people you know being cooped up in their homes uh like that in 2020 was you know nobody liked that nobody enjoyed doing that uh was it all worth it i mean my stance on that is definitely not i think in the beginning with the two weeks to stop the spread i was all for that and i don t change my stance on that because we had so much we didn t know but um this this meta analysis is based on 24 major studies that found that there was a 0 2 reduction in death and obviously we couldn t know that when we first put these policies in place but we found out a lot more as as time went on like transmission isn t happening outdoors and then you know we still have bands on beaches i was out in la and they were chasing surfers off the beach at 5am going out alone and giving them a thousand dollar citations when that was probably the healthiest thing that a person could have done both physically mentally in terms of not spreading a disease to anyone else because they re outside and there were so many ridiculous lockdown restrictions i don t think this means that all of our restrictions in the first place were ill founded but ultimately i think that we do need to look back and remember that you know suicide attempts for teen girls are up 50 that 200 000 businesses closed across the us in the first year of the pandemic there s learning losses there s domestic abuse there s a ton of unforeseen consequences and you know i think this is a pretty bad result of all those other sacrifices that we we took when ultimately potentially it didn t really save that many lives in the end it s really unfortunate so i think there s this phenomenon in these when these studies come out where people have this motivated reasoning where you re like all right what was my previous position on the pandemic and let me just find evidence that confirms that and dismiss evidence that doesn t and so i m trying really hard not to do this with the study and for people who aren t long time listeners or viewers you know we found data previously some from the economist some from politico that seemed to strongly suggest that places like florida and sweden weren t the catastrophes that many of us had predicted and so there was other data outside of the study i think that suggests that what the study is saying um may be valid but i think when i look at this there is there are some questions i have about this particular study um you know the fact that it s not john hopkins medical school and public health because i think what people think of john hopkins they think of all right this is the premier public health institution and and i don t think this is coming from it s not that s true um the second is it hasn t been peer reviewed yet but the third and ricky i wanted to ask you about this is i ve seen some commentary about the fact that it was a meta study that started with 18 000 plus studies and that got down to 34 and then from 34 to 24 i ve seen some people say hey uh they didn t explain how to go from 34 to 24 what s your sense in reading this study yeah so this is something that i dug into a lot because that figure of 34 to 24 has been tossed around a lot in the media and it goes back to this fact checker who um essentially said that there was no reasoning behind it and so i wanted to dig into that because i think that s a pretty egregious mistake if that s the case and this is coming from three well respected although potentially partisan in a sense uh economists and so i dug into the study and there s five pages to explain how they went from eighteen 000 down to 34 and there s a flow chart and there s all these different steps and you can follow that exactly and then if you actually dig further into the study itself there s five more pages about how that 34 became 24 based on what they call quality dimensions and you know i m not a scientist i can t review whether these quality dimensions are great but they re in there there s an explanation and i think that it d be great to see other people who are experts in the field dig in and make sure that this is not somehow motivated but there s no evidence as far as i can see that it is as somebody who s a layman and i think it s also important to point out that these fact checking websites end up kind of just getting the air of like that s always fact and i looked up the person who had written it who has a studio arts degree like we re we re all trying to understand this data and come at it and then you know as soon as someone says oh i m the the purveyor of facts well then everyone s debunking this study based on this one issue and i i m not going to come down and say oh this study is definitely true or definitely false or there s no motivated reasoning but there certainly is an expressed motivation for um going from 34 to 24 and i think that s important to point out and so if we re just keeping score at home like the claim that they did didn t provide any reasoning from 30 40 to 20 pages is not true whether we don t know like whether those are the right reasons or not no idea one thing i m seeing out there in the public debate on this is the guy who did this study is i think very clearly on record uh with his beliefs right like he has been throughout three minutes yeah calling lockdown s fascist and he s fairly pro trump which is like an economist can be pro trump that doesn t disqualify you from having well that s what the trump association is only based off of one tweet as far as i could find just accrediting trump s due regulatory policies for allowing the vaccine to be developed so quickly which i don t think is i think it was the wording of it that got me where he was basically like it was the juxtaposition of fouchy and trump and basically he was calling out fauci you know i read it differently like i think he was saying that we developed the vaccine faster than fauci had originally predicted because trump had pulled back so many regulations and allowed it to go through with operation warp speed which i think is credit where credits do i m not a big trump fan but that s something that he certainly did achieve um and i also think that yeah there s definitely the potential that somebody s biases get wrapped up in something like this but it is a very expansive meta analysis these are 24 big studies that looked into how effective these lockdowns were and i d love to see other experts in the field that can make sure that someone s biases didn t trickle in here yeah and i think if i m being honest like if somebody were pro lockdown and then had a study like this that showed the opposite i m not sure how many people would be like that s a biased person in the end he didn t collect the data of the individual studies and as long as these were um chosen in a valid and unbiased way i don t know that there s any evidence yet to cast out on this and there aren t any big meta analyses that are saying something entirely different so i think that we need to wait to see more people process this new data and and learn from our mistakes if this is actually true and only 0 2 of deaths were reduced by lockdowns that s really sad considering everything else that happened as a result yeah and i think like like in the end it is interesting that this is not being picked up a ton right like like this john johnson didn t do a uh press release on this and they typically do with all their studies yeah why do you think that is i m not sure him i don t want to get too deep i don t want to yeah i mean i could come up with a conspiracy theory but i m not going to say it well i i will just point out that the first week in march when all the lockdowns were happening espn was releasing the last dance so documenting on michael jordan and so i m not going to say there was a correlation but i mean just if you want to get the truth look to espn that s all i have to say well this is a great conversation we want to thank you all for watching and or listening make sure to

that s fighting for parental rights not sure what men s motives are i know for as long as i ve been aware of him he s not like the orange county board of education he really targets us and they re they re pretty mean tweets so um i don t think he s a friend of ours i think he s targeting us for his own personal political ambitions and i m very surprised by it introduces this bill he never once came and talked to us wrote a letter to us anything else is being done to us and not with us he s clearly just after us and not wanting to talk to us and trying to do this to us music applause this is lori kaler with costa mesa brief reporting on senate bill 286 this is not something that we want here in orange county who is it that gave us this bill senator david min who is david min what what do we know about him he somehow was elected to state senate defeating the term cons long term conservative john morlock with california teacher association and planned parenthood funds men does not have a california license to to practice law but he s a law professor at uc irvine min calls himself a native of california but he was born in rhode island he s not a native from orange county since he grew up in san francisco after attending law school on the east coast he worked at the security exchange commission and later as a securities litigator for a washington dc law firm min is a former staff attorney and banking committee policy advisor for u s senator and current senate majority leader chuck schumer min was an associate director for financial markets policy at center for american progress a left leaning think tank on extreme and social issues mint also introduced another legislation senate bill 264 banning firearms sales from state owned properties which was amended to apply only to the orange county fairgrounds shutting down their gun shows starting january 1st of this year joining me now are members of the orange county board of education to share their reactions to this bill president mary barkey i know that there was an article written about you previously and where you were interviewed would you please share what your reactions to this bill the author behind it and what his possible motives may be well first of all i was very surprised i only learned about the bill the day before the orange county register called me to discuss it so very surprised that it came out of nowhere and really surprised it was only targeting orange county board of education wasn t a statewide bill i understand he tried to make it a statewide bill but he couldn t get any support from his fellow senators he even had a co author when the bill started he had senator umberg i understand later removed his name so it doesn t seem like it s a very popular bill not sure what men s motives are i know for as long as i ve been aware of him he s not like the orange county board of education i have seen tweets dating back to 2020 where he really targets us and they re they re pretty mean tweets so um i don t think he s a friend of ours i think he s targeting us for his own personal political ambitions and i m very surprised by it thank you we have had elections in june 50 years ago up until the present who is this man to change the way we do elections um we have we have lisa sparks trustee alicia sparks un vice president ken williams wrote the rebuttal article which was published in the orange county register on january 18th would you please share what with us why this bill for election reform is misleading does it make does it make the process less confusing or more confusing and how would this bill impact the voters in orange county who have chosen the candidates for the last several decades well sb 286 has nothing to do with election codes as daveman is purporting to be concerned about you know he is sort of a media trying to get attention in orange county trying to make a name for himself at the expense of orange county voters and that s a problem you know the orange county board of education basically he s hovering over the target because we re getting things right we ve approved more charter schools than any other county in our 58 counties in the nation you know why would he single out orange county out of our 58 counties to change the voting election laws you know the voters put us into office because they re believing in what we re doing for parental rights and um and the you know expanding parental choice and rights expanding public charter schools for parents to be able to walk with their feet to schools that work for them you know we ve highlighted in sunshine controversial issues that the public had no idea about such as the california healthy youth act and the critical race theory that are being implemented in public schools without parental knowledge so that parents can have an idea of what to ask of their schools and districts so this senator men state senator men uh you know a uc law professor imported from wherever he was imported on the east coast not that that s a bad thing but i m just saying this makes no sense he didn t have support from his own state senators even on his own side and he s just wanting to do anything he can to sort of break up the board the board majority that s fighting for parental rights for the voters of orange county and the voters put us in office we ve been elected in in half of us have been elected in the primary in the gubernatorial year and the other half are elected in the presidential uh general election and that s been going on for more than 50 years so this just makes no sense it is indeed a crazy bill makes absolutely no sense thank you lisa sparks and trustee tim shaw as a father of five boys i know that you as well as these other trustees care about the children and their parents who desire the best interest for their children for their academics their innocence how would this bill possibly impact the families in orange county and please share any other thoughts about this bill or about this author that you have well thank you yeah it s actually father of six boys i apologize we added one four years ago so well the the bill i mean the fact that he he s not applying it to other counties kind of speaks to probably his motives if this was a good idea why isn t it being done in all the counties he only specifically made it about orange county another part that s going to be confusing to voters we elect our superintendent the superintendent s election would remain in june but the board of education members would be in november so i think that that on its face makes no sense and at any time the board could um change the election to november and i i if there was a spirit of cooperation maybe he could have written us a letter or called us up hey i have an idea why don t you guys move it to november instead he just introduces his bill he never once uh came and talked to us wrote a letter to us anything else it can be is being done to us and not with us and so i think if there was any kind of spirit of you know cooperation i i think that s the way he would have approached it but he s clearly just after us and not wanting to talk to us and trying to do this to us right it does sound very disingenuous and insincere and wonder what his motives truly are this does not sound like this is to make things easier and less confusing to me this is going to make things more confusing like you said i would just add that not only is he working closely with the union bosses of of california and probably nationwide as well since he worked for chuck schumer for god s sake um but also the the county committee that s going to approve our redistricting that we put forth a map that has zero deviation for that s aligned with the the census uh we put it forth the way we re supposed to by december 15th deadline well this county committee that is 11 people who are not elected by the voters but they re selected by school boards are going to make a decision to not approve our map five and they ve been delaying and delaying and so obviously they re working with the union bosses as well to try to do anything to break up our our board majority fighting for parental rights uh and sunshining important issues in orange county so it s just they re kind of trying to hit us at all fronts and you know we re standing tall and we re you know sunshining the truth whenever possible and thank you for giving us this opportunity to talk with you to you know let the voters know what s going on well and i wonder as well do do those that supported him are they concerned about how he s spending his time his two big pieces of legislation one was shutting down the gun show which is tremendous revenue to orange county and i know that there s been a lot of documentation that there s been no crimes from gun sales at gun shows so so you know the county lost quite a bit of revenue and then his other bill is to move an election i mean we re paying his salary the taxpayers are paying a salary and what what is his objective is he really solving the problems of orange county i don t think he is and i think he doesn t like that we are that we are very accountable to our constituents you know even during the toughest of times the last two years we ve never had a virtual meeting here at the county we are always here for the constituents and all but one meeting we ve had an audience and we give them a forum and they can always come and talk to us and we listen i i would add one thing too you know we re talking about senator minn a lot but there s a premise here that assembly members and senators from northern california central california all across the state should be deciding when the orange county board of education holds their elections it s crazy on its face if there s if there s going to be a change why wouldn t that be the elected representatives in orange county or the voters in orange county why are we asking a state senator from chico or san francisco or wherever to make this decision it s it s completely violating the whole idea of local control and letting us decide you know what we want to do in our county and other counties that have the same election none of their senators would author the bill with him and that says something too that they didn t feel that there was an appetite for that or a need for it so and speaking of how he s hurting orange county with that other bill that you were talking about that uh that the gun show can t be held at the state fairgrounds across the state but he singled out orange county and what i understand is it s a million dollar loss every year and so now a lot of the constituents are saying well we re just going to avoid any anything at the county fairgrounds given that this is the case so we re going to lose even more millions of dollars you know with that that single decision so what is senate bill 286 uh this is a if it passed would change election cycles of the members of the orange county board of education from the june primary elections to the november general elections why is this an a problem it s a problem because we ve been singled out why only orange county it s very concerning that one county board of education was singled out is because we re such an effective county board of education is it because we re so pro parental rights and we protect parental rights every day yes and it s a fundamental change in voting for the orange county department of education leadership positions producing the exact problem that men says he wants to correct that is bringing about more confusion and greater voter disenfranchisement right the problem and i believe that you tim shaw brought up the other issue about the superintendent as well would you just reiterate sure so we elect our superintendent county wide and that would remain in the june election what his bill is trying to do is only move the five trustees on the board of education to the november election so if you re a voter you would go in in june and vote for the superintendent and then november a few months later have to make a separate decision for the board member that would represent you so it would it would it doesn t make sense why wouldn t we be on the ballot together and one thing in reading his arguments about why this is a good bill i was somewhat offended that he s talking about different groups of people who just apparently can t be bothered to vote in the june election they only somehow vote in the november election it s very insulting to people that you know well these people can t be bothered to vote twice in the same year so they only vote in november so we need to uh move this election to november how profoundly insulting of course a voter is able to vote in june and november they re they re not so stupid and it it just really talks down to to the voters and i i really was offended in reading his his argument so the orange county register article that you were interviewed in mary says members of orange county school board could face bigger more liberal electorate very interesting that it was actually the orange county register that brought that out i didn t even mention that so here a newspaper is is looking at his bill saying wow this is really a political grab for the democratic party and it is rather insulting to the voters it brings about voter disenfranchisement so we ve got this ivory tower uc law professor okay saying oh voters you know you don t know what you re doing you don t know how to vote let me let me show you how to vote in the november election very insulting i agree yes i think the motive is what s concerning is what he s trying to accomplish my response to uh the register was i d actually campaign the same way i m not going to campaign any differently i believe in getting out there and touching the voter and if you touch the voter and you remind him what we re doing and how much we care about children and families rather than the union who holds a lot of board seats that don t really work for the families thank you so much for coming and i know that you guys are very busy and you re fighting for the children of orange county so i really appreciate you taking this time to share your thoughts on senate bill 286 and about senator dave min and what his possible motives could be about this thank you well thank you so much lori we also appreciate your time in asking such great questions and wanting to know what s going on we really appreciate

to another episode of sac town talks today we re joined by assemblywoman akilah weber joining us akilah how s it going thanks for joining us i m good how are you thank you so much for having me very well very well thank you you know because the coved you know a lot of us haven t you know got to know you or kind of hear your story uh you know we all know your mother and you know she was on the the show in 2020 and she s you know always great to have uh so can you you know for those who don t know can you kind of give us a little bit about your background and kind of what brought you to sacramento sure of course well i am a san diego native was born and raised actually in the district that i currently represent after high school i left for a very long time about 16 17 years i went to college med school residency fellowship and was working in other areas throughout the country um i moved back in 2013 because i wanted to start to give back to the community that had given so much to me i am an ob gyn board certified ob gyn i did a fellowship in pediatric and adolescent gynecology so when i moved back to san diego i founded the pediatric and adolescent gynecology division at rainy children s hospital which is the children s hospital in san diego um and i also started getting very active within my community and politically active as well i kind of grew up around politics and understood the importance of always making sure that that you know different voices were at the table and in 2018 a situation happened in my city where a young african american high school senior female was slammed to the ground by one of our police officers and at that time i decided i needed to do a little bit more and so i ran for city council in my area became the first black american to be elected to city council in my city and uh was you know doing some really important work on my local city council and still practicing so being a mommy of two amazing uh little boys um and then the pandemic hit in 2020 and that really changed a lot and so when this seat opened up i decided to run for it uh for a couple of reasons one um within the 79th assembly district we have had someone who s been a very strong advocate for the needs within our district but also just a strong advocate up and down california in general i wanted to make sure that that legacy continued but also realizing that we need to make sure that we have diversity at the table when making laws and policies and not only diversity in terms of your your race or your gender but also your background and being in the midst of a pandemic understanding that at the time in the assembly there was one physician and one physician in the senate really drove home the point that we need to make sure that we have more people in the health care field um actually in sacramento formulating the laws and legislation that not only impacts how we practice medicine but also the patients that we serve and so that s why i decided to run and uh i ve been having a good time so far wow so so back when you re on the city council you were still working and practicing as a doctor i was and um because i live in a smaller city within the district la mesa i love it um so i was able to do it because it was part time but i still practice now so when i go i go when i go home to san diego on fridays um two fridays a month have fridays i have clinic and then one half friday i m in the operating room are you delivering babies or what kind of so i m not doing the obstetric part but i am doing a surgical part okay wow yeah that s that s a lot on your plate that s amazing but it s good because it keeps you know it keeps me doing the other part that i love right there was a lot of time and and energy that i put into um becoming a physician exactly what is it is it four years of med school and then how long is the residency how long before you can actually start practicing on your own for whatever well i did four years of med school four years of residency and two years of fellowship and that was after four years of college so um and and i loved what i was doing um especially some of the specialized surgeries that i was doing so i m very happy that i was able to continue a very small portion of my practice i miss my adult patients i miss delivering babies right now but i i m so happy that i get a chance to still do my surgeries kind of growing up can you kind of tell us about i guess your family and kind of how it was kind of being raised by shirley weber so um you know i had i was very blessed with two amazing parents so uh that were both very active um in their own regards so you know everyone is very familiar with my mom she um when i was growing up was a professor at san diego state and also was on the school board i think she joined when i was like maybe at the end of my elementary year and then throughout 7th 12th she was still on sangha unified school board always very active a very powerful force within san diego community a great role model someone to look up to my father was very active as well he was a personal injury attorney and then became a administrative law judge but was very active within the naacp was past president of our local naacp was very active within the black lawyer association um was very good friends with speaker willie brown and and all of the people up here so i kind of grew up with two parents in that space and i actually honestly never thought i would go into politics which you know medicine because you see the good the bad and the ugly but what they instilled in both my brother and i was the importance of giving back um the importance of advocacy and the importance of making sure that everyone has a voice and for those who either don t use their voice or don t know how to use their voice it is your responsibility to use it for them so you know there are a lot of people that kick down a lot of doors for me to be able to get here a lot of people whose shoulders i stand on a lot of people who unfortunately died fighting for the rights that i have today and so it is my responsibility to keep those doors open to open up more doors and to make sure that we have a california that really works for everyone how has your experience been coming up to sacramento you kind of came you know in the middle of the pandemic in the middle of a session uh how has it been getting acclimated and kind of you know getting your footing here when you know everything is just i guess so new and you know evolving with uh kind of changing and and things like that it s been very very interesting um you know i a lot of people say oh well you know what to expect or you know what s going on and i m like no i i had a life in san diego i had a two jobs i had you know two boys so i wasn t necessarily focused on the inner workings of sacramento but um you know i really appreciate my other assembly members my other simply colleagues they they were very warm and welcoming um i did come in in april which was actually after the the um the deadline to submit bills but two of my colleagues did give me um one each of their bills so that i was able to carry some some bills last year um and they ve just been you know very good if i ve had any questions now we re still in a pandemic so still kind of doing this like meeting people via zoom ish which is you know different for sacramento but um but it s been good so far yeah you know it s interesting talking to all the the members about the new swing space kind of what are your thoughts and how are you enjoying your new your new office you know i like it so you know if you talk to people i know if you talk to people who have been here for a while they don t like it i even um so you can t see but like right across the street is the secretary of state s office right so i know right so my mom came over and she was like oh you know and a lot of people who were over there longer are like oh but i actually like it i um i love sun i love light um i love windows this place is a lot i think overall for everyone s well being just healthier because there s just so much sunlight um that i i actually like it i m i m i m happy here that s funny we were talking to miyabanta yesterday and she she felt the same thing i was like oh yeah it s open it s new it s it s great so yeah it seems like the new members are like in the space more than the older ones it s funny yeah if you had spoken to me in the old space you wouldn t be seeing this light back here you know i didn t have any windows in my office and um you know i i understand the importance of light and sunlight i went to med school in rochester new york where it was gray for like half the year um so you know it s important to have your sunlight you know so i guess is this i guess you know the beginning of the year the governor comes out with with his budget kind of what are your some of your thoughts on the on the budget kind of what are some of the things that i guess you d like to see prioritize more well you know we um are still in the midst of a pandemic and so i was very happy to see that that there are still money and resources being allocated to make sure that we have testing sites that we are still continuing with education and that if we need to ramp up again within the hospital system that we will have the ability to do that um and so that you know for me because that right now is kind of on the forefront of my mind and hopefully most people s mind to make sure that we are able to get through this and hopefully stay out of it but if we end up having to go back that we re ready to go back um you know the other issue that was very important and again done with covet had to do with sick leave um and so that had expired um back in september unfortunately we weren t able to get something done in the last legislative session um and so i was very happy that we were able to do that this time so with his um initial budget priorities and the initial things that we voted on um i ve been very happy with with the things that we ve been able to focus on yeah so i guess we just had the big deadline for bill introduction kind of what are some of the things you re working on and i guess how many bills did you end up with so um as of right now i have about 14 or 15 bills um and um and i m actually really really happy with my bill package it s very um i like to say diverse um kind of touch on some some big priorities but also some things that came out of the district so like i said you know we re still in the midst of this pandemic and um one of the things that s important to me not only as a physician but you know as a mom with kids in school is that we are able to keep all californians hate healthy and safe um that we re able to keep our schools open and our businesses um thriving and so there are a group of us um that people affectionately call the vax caucus or the vaccine caucus oh really yeah and um and so with us we have introduced eight bills so far dealing with vaccines um or around coveted in general and so my the bill that i am um pushing out from that uh caucus is ab1797 which deals with updating the california immunization registry and what this would do is um one gives schools the ability to have you know access to the immunization registry the california immunization registry they do have limited access at this point but only can really only report on those um vaccines that are required um and so you know it s hard right now for them to to say who s been vaccinated with coveted vaccine or not because that s not a required vaccine at this point um and it also requires physicians that give out vaccines to make sure that they re putting this information into the vaccine registry and then the other thing the bill does which is very important is that as you re putting the information into the vaccine registry you also input the race and ethnicity unless the particular patient or parent opts out and the reason why this is so important is because we know about health disparities we know about um issues as far as who s getting immunizations and who s who is not and so this is actual data to prove that there are some disparities there or there aren t and if there are disparities then we can focus our efforts and resources on those communities to help make sure that we re getting um the information to them and that we re also providing access for for those communities to become vaccinated so that s a big part a big priority for me the other priority for me is really closing the academic achievement gap that is that s that s been out there for a very long time and it s not moving and the way in which we do that is by one keeping kids in school and two making sure that we re giving resources to those that that need it the most and so i actually have two bills that i ve introduced around this one is ab2598 and what that does is that is a restorative justice bill and that basically within the california department of education would establish a baseline restorative justice practices or standardized restorative justice practices for all schools here in california and um and would require that the school districts use those first instead of the more disciplinary things that we have seen with certain um ethnic background or so some social economic background and so i m very happy about that one and then the other one is example on that one so um so for example like if someone um let s say you hit a kid right um and instead of uh suspending you or um you know taking something away from you you have a discussion about why that was wrong you as the child go and apologize to their child you hear from that other child about how that child felt by being hit um and you just have more of a it s not a discipline but it s a learning method and um and it s done it s done studies have shown that it works um that when you when you do these things in schools that you have a much lower rate of suspension you have better attendance and ultimately you have better graduation rates and you can see differences in how children are quote disciplined based on race and social economic status so this would basically be something that just says you know what this is a method that we need to instill first in all of our schools before we go to the suspension or the expulsion or the detention which are all negative factors um another thing that another bill is 2744 that looks at lcf lcff funding and what it would do is it would establish a new category to essentially provide funding to the lowest subgroup or the lowest performing subgroup of students that s not already receiving funding so right now what do we know we know that african americans are at the lower end of the achievement gap and it has been that way for a very very very long time and so since they at this time are the lowest performing uh subgroup there would be more money and more resources sent to the schools based on where you have a higher rate of african americans to implement programs and um and and things to help close that gap whether it s tutoring whether it s um you know what when i grew when i was growing up we had um mentors at the school that worked supposedly just with african american males but they ended up actually working with everybody but it really helped out as far as the academic achievement and the outcomes of our african american males and so the lcff bill would create this new subcategory to give more money more resources to hopefully close that gap that unfortunately it s just continuing to wide um so that s my stuff around education as a doctor as an ob gyn i m very much interested in reproductive health reproductive justice and access and unfortunately we are you know in a situation at this point where it is highly likely that roe versus wade will be overturned and what we re going to see here in california as a result of that is that we re going to have more people coming into our state looking for those services that they cannot receive in their states it is estimated that if roe versus wade is overturned that there will be about 26 states that in which you will not be able to receive those services and so um there is a group of us within the women s caucus that are working on a variety of different bills and my specific bill deals with funding that funding gap providing a pool of money to allow for providers to to do these procedures and get reimbursed for them whether or not the particular patient has insurance or if their insurance just refuses to pay for it um and so that is an anticipation of what we all kind of think is going to happen coming down from the supreme court um and then i ve got some local things uh you know we did a a call out in my in my community in my district to say hey what kind of bills would you like to see uh pass this upcoming year or at least introduce this upcoming year and one that was very interesting we turned into a bill 80 16 30 it s called the vulnerable defendant s right act to a fair trial and this came out of a story where there was an individual who was deemed incompetent to stand trial in one county and before competency could be re established they were arrested in another county tried and convicted and no one had even ever checked to see what happened in this other county and so this would basically mandate that one you checked to make sure that this particular person had not been deemed deemed incompetent and two had if they had been deemed incompetent that at some point competency was restored before you can take them and put them on trial and you know i m very proud of that actually came out of my district one of one of the constituents actually um suggested that and then one of the things that i did do when i first got here was i um got the other delegation san diego delegation together to do an audit of our county jails because there are a lot of deaths in san diego county jails a lot of unanswered questions and that audit was just released a couple of weeks ago and um you know unfortunately what it showed is what people had been saying for a long time san diego county jails have the highest rate of death in any county in the state and there were some glaring glaring deficiencies some glaring things that really need to be changed um our standard of how we treat our inmates especially with their their physical and mental health needs to be raised and so my office is now working on a bill to basically improve the standards statewide because one of the things that the audit brought was yes san diego county is bad but there s really no specific county in california that we can point to and say this is the one that you should be modeling yourself after there are national standards but we don t have like the golden county here and so we re working on a bill to just raise our standards to align with um national standards um you know a when you re in jail or when you re sent to prison or while you re waiting for trial because unfortunately about half of these people were just waiting for trial and died it shouldn t be a death sentence and so we need to make sure that not only in san diego county but in all 58 counties here in california if you happen to be incarcerated um that you are taking care of and that you don t die just based on people not doing what they should be doing or listening to your your physical or mental needs right you know i guess kind of touch back up on your um kind of um your your piece of legislation dealing kind of with the the roe v weight issue and a lot of people are talking about that and a lot of people are fearful about that and you kind of hear this kind of dialogue oh well we re in california like what it doesn t affect us can you kind of i guess kind of touch upon that thought and you know that s something i never thought about is that you know people will be coming here to to getting abortions and kind of what other fallouts do you see that yeah you know we um in a sense we are very fortunate here when we re dealing with roe versus wait before i move back to um california i was actually living in dallas texas and practicing in dallas texas and um you know when i was there i just saw everything that was going on even back then and i was like this state has a war against women s health and so we re very fortunate in that i don t think anyone can say that here in california but you still have the ability an insurance company can still say that we re not going to cover this and you have to come out of pocket in some rural areas you still may have to go farther than you would like to go to receive um the care in terms that you would need and so you know even here in california we can still have some improvements um and then you know when i saw that when this last not this president but the president before was elected i started talking to a lot of my colleagues um in this space and i said what are we going to do because i see this happening i see roe versus wade happening what are we going to do here in california because this is going to become a place where people come to um and they re going to need our services we re going to need to beef up in terms of the number of providers that we have that can perform certain procedures like i said we re going to need to also make sure that there s a funding source so even though we are we don t have to really worry about um it not being available here in california if we don t beef up some of these things then either one your insurance can say that it s not going to pay for it or two because we have the mass influx of people from outside you have to wait longer to get the procedure or the care that you need and so we ve got to make sure that neither one of those happens and that s why these bills and these discussions right now are so very important yeah it s fascinating it seemed like you know forever that you know roe v wade would never be overturned and they d talk about it and you re like yeah but is that really gonna happen and it just seems so surreal i know i i talking about this today i never thought i honestly never thought like 10 years ago i would have never thought that but um you know there are a lot of things that have happened over the last you know four or five years we never thought would actually happen um between 2016 and 2020 i know right um but unfortunately when you have something like roe versus wait because even like the voting rights right you know like this is something that we re talking and who would think that we re talking about voting rights who would think that we are seeing states implement modern day jim crow laws like you would think that we were past that but unfortunately i think what we re all learning is that some things that we thought were permanent and solidified really aren t and so we have to make sure that we find ways to permanently solidify a lot of these things i honestly before this had no idea that the voting rights was something that was voted on every you know so many years and then this year or this you know this last time when when it wasn t voted on it s like wait a minute what do you mean what are you talking about and um and so it s it s been it s been interesting but i think it should hopefully fire some sense of passion and once again fire and a lot of us especially our youth um to say that we ve got to always um be awake and and make sure that we re understanding what s going on and not take certain things that we think are going to be here forever for granted you know you were talking about how you were in this what is it what do you guys call the vaccine caucus is that what you guys call yourself that s what we re yeah that s what we re kind of known as it s um and we got together we started this actually during the summer recess last year because we kind of saw that there may be an uptick in covet around uh winter time but it s um myself assembly member lowe assembly member wix um senator pan senator newman and senator weiner and we ve been working on these bills and kind of you know i guess is it surprising to you seeing this kind of vaccine hesitancy and you know a lot of discussion about kids and vaccines and uh you know it kind of bewildering to me and a lot of people but you know it seems to be a major issue and kind of what do you guys expect and you know how how do you deal with this yeah well you know it s definitely unfortunate it s um you know i think that over time um there s just been a growing number of people who are just against vaccines in general but with this particular um virus and this particular vaccine it was so politicized and i in my lifetime do not remember anything like this being politicized you know whether it was the flu or ebola somewhere else like i don t remember you know it s science is science and um and so i think because it was so politicized that s why we re saying what we re seeing today i mean and i was talking to a friend earlier because i was looking at like vaccination rates from different states and um you know you can you can see the difference unfortunately in what are considered quote blue states and what are considered quote red states in terms of um the percent of facts of their population that it s vaccinated so it s that s why we re seeing it this time i mean i think that it s natural to be concerned about something new um i i admit you know when i got the vaccine i was like oh my goodness because i was practicing at the time i was doing surgeries and so the first week that it came out i had to get it and i was like oh my god oh my god but now we ve had so many people that have gotten the vaccine that um you know there have been more people that have gotten it than we ve had in any previous study or trial or anything before anything came came out that you know a lot of the the concern or the rhetoric is is completely unfounded um there was a mother at my son s school who said oh i m not going to have my daughter get the vaccine because i want her to have children in the future i was like what wait huh you know so because now there s this thought that it s going to cause infertility so um it s it s it s unfortunate it s unfortunate because it is a virus that is still very contagious and for those who are not vaccinated it is potentially so very deadly and um you know it s also a virus that you don t know once you get it what that long haul syndrome is going to be for you and you know i have my dad is from louisiana i went to school and i went to college in louisiana and i have family in louisiana that think a little different than i do and i spoke with one of my cousins a few weeks ago and found out that he had just gotten out of the hospital because he s not vaccinated and he had been in with covet for 22 days in the icu 18 of those days i see 18 of those days because he believed that the vaccine had killed someone so it s um it is it is unfortunate that it s been so politicized because it allows for all this misinformation and disinformation to get out there and just when rampant in our communities right and i guess how has it been kind of being a mom and being now an elected i guess full time elected and also working at a doctor you know how are you spending time with finding time for the family and being able to balance that yeah my oldest is ten my baby is eight and my oldest is just like whatever you know as long as you do my math with me i m fine because when dad does it with me that s when i get a c so um and my baby s like as long as you come home on thursdays and you don t leave until monday morning you know i can deal with it um but i um i make sure that i spend as much time with them when i am back in the district as possible it s baseball season i m so excited we re all so excited about that um but i also see them i call them every morning before they go to school but i also set up zones with them um every day so that i can do their homework with them and so i just copy their homework from their books i bring it up here with me um and i either go through it with them or with my son like i said i actually do the math which has been interesting i m like i m like google like did i do this right or am i i m on my calculator like did i do this decimal fraction thing right um you know just to make sure that there s still that connection and also academically that they re not going to be like you know falling behind or anything like that but but we re making it work i make dinner for the week on sundays for them so they because they don t like their father s cooking so i made dinner for them throughout the week are they eating out behind your back well i i check when i get back how much of this food have you guys eaten um because yeah i didn t want them end up eating out or just skipping meals and you know their uniforms and stuff are ready for them for the week so i do as much as i can over the weekend to make sure that their week is you know seamless and smooth and then on the weekends i spend as much time with them as i can and i take them to different events they don t like it but you know what i had to do it when i was younger and i turned out okay so that s too funny and you get do you see your mom often up here in sacramento or she up and down the state pretty frequently she s up and down the state um i actually stay at her place uh so when she happens to be in town i see her but i will usually see her at least one day on the weekends because she wants to see her grandkids right so i ll take him over there that s awesome well it sounds like you know you re going to be busy this year yeah i m excited yeah a lot of exciting stuff it should be interesting to see uh how you guys uh you know take it on and uh you know thank you for your work and especially taking on that vaccine issue you know that s always a bear yes i know trust me music social media has shown me how challenging that is exactly exactly so yeah you re gonna you re gonna have your hands full with that but best of luck to you this session and uh excited to see how it goes and hopefully we can touch base with you later in the year to see how everything went definitely thank you so much for this i enjoyed it great talking with you all right bye music oh music,"roe v wade,out of pocket,reproductive

cities doing coming out of covet 19 you know i guess the rental assistance is going to i guess expire this month so i guess kind of heading into the end of the year and into next year are are they recovering nicely or kind of do you see i guess problems no definitely a lot of problems um i think like i said my communities i depend on the small businesses so we re trying to make the small businesses you know whole again um either through legislation through assistance for them and i think the number one priority is to get everybody back to work after the the moratorium ends i hope not but i believe that there s going to be an influx of folks losing their their their homes their apartments and i think the way we we can head that off is by making sure that everybody s back at work and so there is that you know folks are uh trying to do the right thing right and make sure that that we re open for business but i think a lot of our community members and i m going to say it um you know believe that um they have this idea about the vaccine um you know for whatever reason that it they re not going to take it so i think the challenge is for us right now is make making sure everybody s vaccinated um so that we that um you know the the local eateries are are comfortable opening because you know you don t infect everybody and but again we have different challenges i represent a community that s more moderate and so i hear a lot of the rhetoric and you know just to be honest with you it s not even the the more red um cities in my area that that have that that belief about the covid and about the vaccine some of my local communities mainly and i and it s uh interesting to me mainly a lot of the older um uh latino women are like no you know they tell me that they you know the misinformation is as being passed along so one lady said she said that uh you know that she s not taking the vaccine because there s a tracker in it and so i i you know instead of i was baffled right but but i i said you know with respect in spanish i said um if they re tracking you like what did you do that you re afraid of being tracked you know and she was like obviously no answer because they re listening to this rhetoric and i said and and if they tracked you what would you be doing i said because they can track me and i can tell you i go to work i pick up the kids drop the kids off at school go to work pick them up go to you know to do my my jobs i said so if they tracked me they would track me you know back and forth from home to work and so i don t know you know what we re afraid of about being tracked because our cell phones track us 100 of the time so so she she didn t quite understand that they re it s interesting there there s two mind frames right so she s talking about the being tracked and when i was trying to be logical about the fear of being tracked um she didn t really have an answer and then so of course i you know i stopped and then you know throughout my conversations with other community members you know some of that information comes comes up and i have to be really honest with you i said okay you guys complain about the state being dysfunctional and that we can t get anything right do you we can t you know we had so many issues with edd and the dmv do you think we re really going to open a department that s going to house all of these people that are tracking us for what i said you already say we re incompetent there s no way in hell that we re going to be able to attract as many people so you know at this point people have already made up their mind and i can you know try to use logic as much as possible but it s still you know one one part of the brain is not connecting with the other they believe the rhetoric but when we try to talk about you know practical things like why would they track us why would folks track us and what would they get out of it and you know for what reason there s no answer so so they get offended and then they just stop the conversation and so it s really that conversation as well so when we go back to talking about how we reopen and how our businesses are doing some of them are opening and some of them are you know not they re afraid and so until we can get into a pattern of you know really getting back uh folks back to work then we can make those businesses whole once the revenue starts coming in then you know our cities are going to start doing better because i told you we i have a majority of small businesses in my area well with 11 cities guess what they depend on they depend on that that revenue from those small businesses so the longer they stay shut down the longer that they re not going to be made whole i mean we can sit and talk about this for hours and hours and hours but i do have to say and i know it s not you know people are gonna talk about uh personal freedoms but i was in san francisco by the way on my spare time because you know i have nothing else to do i completed the san francisco half marathon uh a couple weeks ago so i was so thank you thank you um you know i have to do something for my sanity which i thought was really insane that i m using a 13 1 mile uh walk to be you know keep my sanity but that s a whole other conversation but when i was in san francisco i was not able to go to any of the eateries or any uh any places in san francisco without showing my vaccine card which i thought wow this is cool because we re not infringing upon anybody s rights if you know if that s what they re saying but you can t just go out to eat them if you don t have your vaccine so those are choices that folks need to make and at some point they need to make them but i really appreciated san francisco because they did not let me into an eatery unless i showed up my vaccine card and you know if you want to go eat out to eat you want to go to war you want to go somewhere if they if uh you want your life to to return then you show your vaccine card if you don t then you stay home not you know not vaccinated i don t know what answer we can give to folks but it s really hurting our businesses by you know having the stance for and against um the vaccine i think you know if we all do um the right thing for ourselves like if i don t want to do the vaccine and i know that s not what we were going to talk about but if i don t want to take that vaccine that s fine but i have two children i have a a a 14 year old and a 13 year old if anything happened to me i would not be able to to forgive myself because you know we were hearing about tragedies all over where children are being left orphaned because both parents are passed again if you don t care about yourself don t get the vaccine but the consequences are if something happens to you you re leaving your children orphaned and i would not do that to my children and so i chose to vaccinate um you know to do that again i know this is not what we re talking about but i think it s important to have that conversation because it affects our businesses i can t open my businesses um fully because we have these breakout cases we have these you know little pockets of of of uh the cobia popping up because we re not doing what we re asked to do because for whatever reason anyway no that s well said and kind of talking with some people in the business community they re part of this kind of anti vaccine or they re worried about these mandates and i kind of you know go back to them as you put is is what s best for your business is for it to be open and for it to be open and and you know you know people have to get these vaccines and we have to you know empty these hospitals out so you know definitely definitely well put right well and then you know if i can add a little bit i ve got family members in kansas yes i have family in kansas and um uh i you know we re in conversations i lost an uncle to covered um in texas in last october um and just last week three of my family members um actually five three my aunt my niece and uh a cousin are hospitalized um because they were not vaccinating and then um some of the kids the kids around um the family members were sick now they were not hospitalized but they were home not not in school their home and uh one of my cousins is a nurse and she s kind of trying to hold the whole family that found part of the family in kansas together and she s devastated she says how can i you know make our family members understand that this is terrible and so as you can imagine uh in kansas the conversation s very different and some of them are democrats most the majority of my family members are democrats so it s not even you know a republican versus democrat it s about the information that s being spread through the news media through the news outlets i don t know how they depend on on facebook and all of the social media outlets to get their information but you know i talked to my brother and i said you know where are you getting your information from and he says oh well the news is saying it the neighbors and i said have you talked to a doctor and he was like no and i said well when you talk to a doctor call me back and then we can have this conversation because you know the news media is is is biased one way or the other i you know can t get into that but unless we do the research and talk to actual doctors and the doctors tell you don t do it then we can have that conversation but i guarantee you that if everybody listening goes that is anti the vaccine goes talk to an actual medical doctor they ll tell you the truth i i you know i engage on social media because i have to but i don t get my news from social media i don t get you know i talked to my doctor when i went to get vaccinated i was like what do you think they re like absolutely get vaccinated you know and again if you re not doing it for yourself do it for your children because if something happens to you you re going to leave um kids that are orphaned sorry i had to add that because you know if anybody s listening and thinks that i m not going through anything trust me my family members are going through it right now and and of course now that they re in the hospital they re like oh my god i should have gotten vaccinated well by then it s it s too late so don t don t let it be too late take care of your children by taking care of yourself hi and welcome to sac town talks thank you so much for watching our content if you like it make sure to hit that like button and please make sure to

district senator dirazzo how s it going thanks for joining us oh i m doing great thank god yeah interesting times to be alive and kind of uh you know in preparation for this show i kind of was you know digging in your background and you you have a quite a fascinating background kind of you know growing up in the central valley going to school up here in northern california then you know ending up in la and kind of working through the labor movement through the past few decades can you kind of for our listeners who don t know can you kind of give us a little background about yourself and how you made your way to sacramento sure um well as you said we were a migrant farmworker family so actually we would travel town to town from calexico all the way to northern california to marysville sacramento area and even as far as oregon so i got to see all these little towns we never really stayed in big cities uh but saw a lot of small towns and you know by being in fresno kind of settling down in in the central valley uh got connected with saint mary s went to school up there have family in northern california but i got connected with some activists while i was at st mary s from los angeles turned out to be you know someone uh um i married uh and then decided to come to to los angeles so i am really glad i did because i love los angeles that was you know i don t know 40 plus years ago right you know i guess it s interesting because you know with your experience i guess up and down the state i guess you ve seen it kind of grow and change um kind of i guess have you been back you know since you ve been elected to some of these farming communities and see i guess how they ve changed since you know when you were a child you know i ve um i ve been through i traveled through um fresno is probably again you know the the hometown there and in some ways there s been some changes certainly fresno has grown enormously from that time and in other ways unfortunately it hasn t changed the way that uh you would want it to you know especially with regards to some of the poverty that s there um but uh i think it s uh you know beautiful people uh that live in in those uh in those towns that work really really hard and it reminds me how grateful we need to be for all the hard work that goes into our agricultural industry those farmworkers are pretty amazing families right so you know you know once you moved to la you got involved with the unions down there and you became you know the leader of unite here were you mostly working in in dc and internationally or were you working state issues as well you know actually i was president of my union in los angeles i always stayed in los angeles and when i got into different positions either regionally or nationally i still did my work out of los angeles the focus for me has always been los angeles except for certain things like uh immigration reform that we have thought we fought over the years very hard for and continue to try to get you know millions of people on a pathway to citizenship so i was really glad to be able to go to different parts of the country whether it was you know massachusetts or florida the east coast chicago or the south texas i was able to connect with a lot of the activism whether it was community activism or it was the labor movement of course in washington dc you have the headquarters for a lot of international unions uh the afl cio i had a position there with the executive council on and all of that was pretty amazing experience for me but always try to use that connection for los angeles and southern california right so kind of what what made you kind of want to switch from you know working with unions and kind of working with government to kind of you know running for office and being elected well as you said i never envisioned myself being the candidate i always was on the side of checking out the candidates who were they could could we trust them you know would they do what we wanted them to do especially with regards to immigrant workers and you know immigrant workers who don t have a ton of money but who contribute enormously to this economy you know i always was on the side of are you really going to get in there and fight for these families so to switch it a little bit i became the candidate um and i truthfully part of the reason i decided to run is we were in the middle we had this campaign where somebody named donald trump uh ran and uh there was there was the environment was changing a lot about immigrants uh changing a lot in a very negative way about women and i just felt that in the political arena we had to have more voices uh for being more respectful of all of everyone in our community so it sort of moved me uh i don t know what exactly but it moved me to to want to run uh there was uh um a trimmed out you know um district um and it was gonna work out just right it was in the district that i had lived in for over 30 years uh so all the pieces just seemed to land and i always felt like i m going in there with no fear of being you know booted out or um that that this community really had the same values as what i ve always fought for yeah so i guess you know i guess running for office and kind of working alongside politicians all these years you know i guess you ve had certain assumptions about what the job would be like i guess you know in your experience have those assumptions kind of held up or is it a little different than you thought you know it s definitely different from what i thought some is the same what i envisioned it but a lot of it is very different i don t think we give enough credit to elected officials publicly elected officials for all the issues that we need to learn to be able to make decisions and vote it you have to learn everything from this morning i was at a listening to experts on water well just that issue alone you have to spend an enormous amount of time trying to understand the difference on water issues from southern california to the central valley to northern california there s issues on education there s issues on workforce development this issue uh on healthcare so the amount of things that we have to learn in order to do the votes and feel good about the votes that we re taking is really a lot and so uh i had not paid attention to that i i that s real different from what um i thought uh was the case um so some things are are are the same i know that there are you have to do you know fundraising which i hate to do but you ve got to fundraise that s a part of running for office you ve got to have the financial support to be able to reach your community um and then the other but the other part that i really um enjoy is being able to get out to the community to get out into the district whether it s here locally whether it s in another part of california and get to know many many more leaders and activists in our districts that are really passionate about what they do there is a group called mujeres de la tierra here that watch out for the l a river is the la river what it should be for the community it s both environmental but it s also all the respect for uh the community that s lived there for many years so there s so many individuals many more individuals that i met that i would not have met i think if i had stayed in the labor movement coming from you know your your union background i guess how much percentage of your time and and effort and kind of legislative priorities are focused on kind of workers rights and union issues versus i guess other issues well i would say that you know a good portion of my time i i don t know how to break it down but it s really about workers working people s issues and whether they re not there s a union involved is really about working people s issues for example i had a bill that was signed into law to eliminate the sub minimum wage for our disabled working men and women that was not a union issue but it was an issue in my opinion about the dignity of work and how what s the least that we should allow to uh that we should require to be paid to people who work so there are many issues that are not particularly quote unquote union issues but they are about the dignity of work and the opportunities we re giving to men and women to do better in their lives i have a firm belief that the poverty in california is due in a big part to we re not paying uh adequate wages and salaries to working men and women and um i know that working men and women have to the families have to live like two in an apartment two families an apartment well that impacts those kids ability to do better in school it impacts whether or not they have connectivity you know privacy issues there s health care issues there s all these things that go back to how are you doing in your job do you have a do you have the uh um do you feel like you really can move forward that you re going to do better in life instead of getting stuck in in one job and at a low pay that s just not good and healthy for everybody so well some might you know look at it as a union issue i see it as the dignity of a working person s issue yeah it s kind of been a interesting i guess year a couple of months is is that you know a lot of uh you know businesses need workers and you know just people aren t coming back to work and you re hearing from a lot of businesses that you know they re down employees or it s very hard to to find employees kind of coming from your background and kind of what you ve known and what you ve seen kind of why do you think people aren t coming back to work as as we expected them to well i think it s probably a sense of um you know this job should allow me to do better in my life um and when i m willing to take the risks to go to work um you know is there respect for this hard work that i m doing so you know i ve not done you know any kind of uh of a study on this but just in general i know that when people feel respected in their work when they re paid good wages when they see themselves as having a future and a career in that work they re they want to go to work they re not hesitant to go to work but if any of those issues are lacking if they re not getting paid something that s fair and decent then they re not going to be excited to go back to work um and or if they think that they re risking their lives and there s not you know the uh uh a respect for that work they re not going to want to go back to work if they see that they re stuck um and unable to get somewhere else a future to look forward to they re not going to be excited about going back to work so i think you know i have yet to hear now in this case i will uh uh invoke the word union but if if um i have not heard from unionized employers that they have any problems in getting people back to work they they know those workers know that they have decent wages and to high wages they have health care coverage they have a pension plan they have a voice in work i i haven t heard too many problems or complaints from uh unionized employers very interesting you know as you kind of noted earlier you know one piece of legislation that you had signed can you kind of i guess give us a recap on some other uh kind of bills you had signed by the governor on some some of the things you were working on this year yes um well we had a bill on the domestic workers uh being able to have a a process to get um to have health and safety rights on the job it s not a requirement of domestic employers household employers but it s working in the direction of we found for example that domestic workers during the the fires in northern california weren t being given the equipment to be able to clean after the fires they re being asked to clean but they weren t given the protections or the equipment to properly clean and protect themselves so we did that for domestic workers we re going in the direction of them having sort of a health and safety rights on the job um that s an another one we also were able to get more low income undocumented workers to have access to health care which they didn t before that really really came to light with the pandemic is that here you had essential industries essential workers without access to health care of course uh their ability to take care of themselves take care of their families was impossible mind you they re working but they don t have access to health care they re working they they can t even in the exchange by healthcare for themselves so we re able to include now in medi cal those of 50 years old 50 or older uh would have access to medical if they re low income um so there are uh you know a number of um pieces of legislation like that interesting you know i think it was announced what a couple weeks ago that you know we re projected to have a 32 billion dollar surplus and you know by the time the end of the year s over maybe even more kind of what are some of your thoughts of some of the priorities we should look at for next year on kind of spending and you know maybe solving some of the state s issues well i think that um i mentioned uh having a briefing on water issues uh there s uh that s one area that we have to look at is how are we addressing the infrastructure that s needed for us to be able to have water to have clean water to have affordable water it s different within the central valley than it is in southern california but we ought to look at how that funding could be used for our infrastructure and maybe even to assist uh those families who can t afford to pay for for good and clean and safe drinking water so that s one the other is our green infrastructure transportation we need to do a better job with public transportation and that s an investment it s going to take an investment on our part at the same time that would be good for the environment it would create uh good well paid jobs and careers uh for thousands and thousands of people uh so that s a good thing that we should uh invest in um of course you know um uh education you know will get uh automatically a certain increase in in funding that s a good thing we had a look and see even though we invested this last budget into the um um you know the internet and broadband uh uh issues we ought to you know look at that again and say is that sufficient are we going in the right direction um so there s a number of ways i think those are really essential things that we need to look at a workforce development we have a lack of workers in certain industries that are really highly needed there are certain industries where there s going to be retirement age leaving their jobs are we ready to replace them there s certain jobs and careers where we don t have the um diversity that we need in health care we need more diversity when it comes to those jobs doctors that we don t have enough uh latinos uh and other african americans so and women so we need to do a better job on the workforce development level uh with you know high road uh employers and high road training programs so i think that there will be a lot of ways uh in which we could invest in people now in such a way that it s gonna um be good in the long term not just you know spending money for the sake of spending money right you know a lot of the past what year or two years a lot of talk has been about homelessness and how to address the statewide homelessness issues uh you know kind of in your district have you seen things improving in the homelessness front with all that s been spending and and you see things i guess improving and i m glad you brought that up because housing is another area where we could invest more of more of our our revenue i do see um music spots of of improvement i know here locally in my district there are several areas in which there s at least uh short term immediate shelter uh and and housing and then a wrap around services that is being done there s at least four areas in my district where um hundreds and hundreds of unhoused uh were persuaded uh to leave their tents leave living on the streets and go into temporary shelter and be open to getting the services that they need by the way that was another bill actually was in the budget started out as a bill of mine which is a homeless hiring tax credit for employers who hired currently or just recent unhoused individuals so that they could get a job and they would be paid 120 of the minimum wage so um i think i could see things starting to happen with more urgency and i m hopeful that other things that we re doing around creating more housing and creating more affordable housing uh that that will uh have even greater impact in with regards to our uh our needs yeah you know uh you know next year s rolling around here pretty pretty quick before we know it what are some of the pieces of legislation you re looking to kind of introduce next week year or maybe you already have introduced that you re looking to kind of work on and address coming up next session well i think that there are are still a few issues around criminal justice that i um particularly interested in one of those is the sun setting of records um criminal justice records um that we know that there are eight million californians who have either been arrested and or convicted uh that means it will show up for the rest of their lives on their records and that has a huge impact on those individuals the kinds of jobs that they could have it has an impact on programs they could become eligible or ineligible for they can t even do things in many cases such as big coaches you know to their kids teams there s so many ways in which we re impacted impacting them by having these records on them for the rest of their lives we spend an enormous amount of money i know because my budget oversees the criminal justice system there we spend enormous amounts of money while they re in incarcerated or right after they get incarcerated there are so many ways in which they want to get back on their feet but they can t we invest in them and we say you know you know for so that they wouldn t be re incarcerated for something else um and yet they still have these barriers barriers to jobs barriers to housing barriers to you know reintegrating um so that s one thing i m looking forward to addressing in the in the legislature um and i like i said i think the uh environment uh jobs connected to a cleaner environment like transportation there s those kinds of things it s what i continue to be very very much concerned and excited to address yeah you know i guess you know you re home you re in your district uh you know you re talking to a lot of your constituents what what are some of the issues kind of on top of mind of a lot of your constituents coming in here to the end of the year uh well you you mentioned uh uh one of them which is our unhoused it is of great concern and i think it s starting to become a concern over in some areas over safety and so it s it s not only our compassion uh and how do we allow in a country in a state that is so wealthy how do we allow so many individuals to continue to live on the street so that s a big concern are we doing enough around mental health needs we found that um that mental health needs uh are you know are becoming younger for younger and younger individuals uh and so are we investing enough there the pandemic impacted a lot of individuals um and young and and older so uh those are some of the things that that have been brought brought to my attention of course we want to make sure that um in our small businesses you know do we have the funding to allow our small businesses to you know continue to do better as we slowly reopen um and give the the the support that our small businesses need right you know there s been a lot of news lately about the capital annex being closed down uh have you said goodbye to your old sacramento office and had a chance to to move into the new building yet you know i was lucky that um you see two days ago i went to sacramento uh and it was the second day that we had moved into the the new building um so i didn t get to say goodbye to the old uh the old office um but you know it s uh it s not as uh spacey in some ways but it you know it s new um and uh we just have to get adjusted to a whole different place i guess we re gonna be there maybe three four five years five years maybe as long as five years that that i m hearing um you know there s some minor things that we ve got to get adjusted to the walking back and forth between this new building yeah yeah you have to have your walking shoes i don t know maybe i ll buy a golf cart or something and find a parking space for that uh you know charge my colleagues you know two bucks you know to get them back and forth um so yeah it s gonna be different we have this open space uh that we didn t have before because it was always to go down the hall and go into an office and come back go back into the hallway this is much more open uh meeting space uh that we have so it s it s things to get uh used to uh um i ll miss the miss the old office that s for sure they re all the same size as i understand it too oh they re all equal there s no there s no they re all yeah yeah yeah so you know we can t get punished and get thrown out of them hear that but yeah it s it s a it s a it s a it s a it s a very nice building very nice building you know a holiday season kind of one of those seasons where you know a lot of members give back to their community kind of what are some of the things you re working on uh you know this thanksgiving and christmas to kind of help your community out and kind of give back well um i m glad yes that we just did for thanksgiving uh we did a number of our own um food giveaways and you find that the need is still quite enormous we have in fact trying to turn the camera around so you could see our hallways packed packed with boxes of toys um that have been donated uh either by individuals or by businesses um you know who look to us to help find you know the right you know the right ways to distribute these toys to uh to children and and to families and i know those kids are looking forward to it there are many families who are not going to be able to buy toys and that s a really very sad thing to see in so many uh in so many parts of our of our district so i ll you know get out there both food and and toys and then continue to see um how can our safety net do a better job of getting our resources into communities sometimes individuals and families are intimidated you know by the system not quite sure how to how to you know navigate the system um and so they rely on uh not the official safety net you know do the applications and fill out all those forms but they rely on you know an organization in their community down the street that does the food giveaway or does the um the toy giveaway you know that s much more they re they re much more trusting of that um so these community based organizations are really essential to helping either access the formal safety net or you know be able to get food and and toys for their kids well that s great thanks for doing that and taking care of your community that s that s a great story and and definitely within the spirit so that s that s uh that s awesome thank you thank you and i i find more more and more and more um more and more individuals are uh anxious to do something like that and contribute back to their communities right definitely well i know you re busy and we we uh got to let you go but thank you so much for taking the time and talking with us about your priorities and your background and we re looking forward to seeing what you re going to do next year and hopefully we can follow up with you and kind of see how it s going absolutely anytime you you make me feel very comfortable about what uh you know what we re talking about so um i appreciate you and

again to another episode of sac town talks today we have a very special guest joining us senator nancy skinner nancy how s it going thanks for joining us hey happy to be with you yeah where are you joining us from today are you in the district are you here in sacramento i am in sacramento in my uh well i ll say capital office but we re in a new building because the capital is going to be worked on in the next couple years yeah so you re in the new swing space how are you i guess enjoying the transition and the the new building so far it s uh it s a transition it s you know getting used to it yeah do you have those curtains come with the office or those temporary well they have these screens yeah they re they come with the office um uh they ve been telling us not to put anything on the walls but of course you know hey we re gonna want to decorate our walls so we will be putting things on the walls so nancy but you know before we started this you know i i ve talked to you many times throughout the years but i ve never looked at your bio this is the first time i looked at your bio and the most interesting thing i saw of many which there are is in 1984 you were a student at berkeley and you also ran for city council is that right yes i was a grad student but yes i ran for the berkeley city council and i won wow and so i i guess were you one of the first students to to do that first and only no other person while they were a registered registered student at cal has been elected now subsequent to me we have a current council member um uh um terribly blanking this day but you know uh anyway he um was elected right after he graduated and he had served in the student government as i had and he had been our external affairs asuc external affairs vice president and that s council member rigel robertson wow even even from the beginning in 1984 you re taking on big issues styrofoam things like that kind of what was it like being on the city council and being a student back then well it was i mean it was juggling a lot because i was also a new mom of all things um but in during that time i was part of a really vibrant community based electoral coalition berkeley citizens action and that organization had was the backbone for the successful candidacies of tom bates for assembly who was later our mayor lonnie hancock for mayor and then later assembly uh ron dellums for congress um you know it was a very strong coalition a very diverse just many many groups uh senior activists great panthers um tenant activists health care activists um student activists um ten rent contr people pro rent control um different we had some of the first lgbtq elected officials we re talking back in the early 80s um so it was this really vibrant coalition and the reason i bring it up is because it made serving on the city council easier because you really felt you were part of this big community and we worked out our positions on a lot of issues and they brought me things it wasn t like i was just um certainly i represented the citizens of berkeley that i represented but it was like this whole coalition brought me good ideas and uh worked in the community to get support for those ideas and so it was a great experience you know you know college football season has just ended and all i hear about nancy is this name image likeness stuff all over athletes are transferring them everywhere getting these big deals and you know you are the the genesis of this the start of this here in california kind of how how did you uh kind of come up with this and um how come your name isn t everywhere on this so you know who would have expected the state senator california state senator uh from berkeley white woman uh that i would be the one to basically change the course of student athlete history and basically um you know it s never you never do anything alone there were you know that the ncaa was under a lot of pressure from court cases from you know so many things it was definitely every time you turned on a college sports game you heard some pundit or announcer or even this athlete themselves talk about how unfair the nca rules were about phony amateurism and such so you know it was really um i suppose you could say timing is the secret of comedy it was like i was a lucky timer but um i ve actually been thinking about that issue for a very long long time when i was a grad student at cal i was one of the people that helped to organize the graduate union of teachers instructors tas which is now the union that represents every type of graduate student employee and i always felt that you know as students we should be compensated for our work if the university is if we re producing something of value for the university we should be compensated for our work and i always looked at athletes i m like you know they re bringing a lot of value to the university but i had the great fortune of hearing a lecture by harry edwards who was a sociologist at cal at uc berkeley but he was also the organizer of the boycott the black suit olympic boycott in mexico city where the runners from san jose state juan carlos tommy smith others you know basically um you know said hey uh this amateurism is doesn t work and he talked about just the way that especially he came from the lens of black and brown athletes generating enormous amounts of profits and money revenue for professional sports for colleges and the fact that they were not adequately taken care of they were exploited and so i looked at it initially from a very um racial uh perspective but over time as i watched as i watched title ix and i saw that women athletes really get the bad end of the stick i mean we don t get a fair amount of time in the locker rooms fair amount of time on the equal equipment fair amount of time on the fields and such and then you look at what in march madness how they treated last year the women basketball players compared to the male basketball players it was just outrageous and i saw that women they don t even get a chance by enlarge to gopro and when they do get pro they re not even paid at all so here they are at the peak of their prowess while they re a student athlete and they can t get anything so like i said i ve been thinking about it a long time and when i first got elected to the state senate in 2016 i told my staff i want student athletes to be paid tas are paid you know others are paid they they ought to be able to form a union and my staff said i was crazy that we would never be able to pull that off and so each year i would come back to him and say nope gonna introduce bill going to introduce bill and they re like no no we won t be able to do that and i said okay you can t tell me no again you have to come up with alternative or i m introducing the bill that i want to and they are the ones who came up working with other people on the concept to give name image and likeness which i think is a first step it should not be the only step right well it s amazing just kind of seeing these these deals kind of sprout up everywhere and and you know with social media and everything the you know the amount of money some of these uh athletes and many women many women yeah great large followings they have so yes uh it s gonna be interesting to watch right definitely definitely changing the world of college sports and hopefully it will help the cal bears right i hope so because cal bears haven t been in the rose bowl since 1959 yeah so you know you re not one shy to take on big issues as if you ve taken on the ncaa and changed college football you know the next thing police unions police records kind of you know how have you seen your work there uh unfolding kind of what do you have planned in the works for the future well um california this is another one we were a real outlier we have a very good public records act so you know if you want if you are a resident you want to have information about in a public employee you can request that information get records on basically every employee right except for law enforcement and so for 40 years there was no public access whatsoever to any records around any activity of an officer now one could say you know why should we need that why why is there need to be public records access there you know sunshine transparency really helps it helps create good government and when it comes to law enforcement law enforcement more than anything needs the trust of the community to do their jobs and when you feel like hey wait a minute you know we we saw this behavior by an officer in our neighborhood we don t see anything that s happened to them you know we don t trust them uh that does not bode well for solving crime right and you could never find out about whether your local police department ever disciplined an office officer for example for any of their misconduct you couldn t even find out what misconduct might have occurred in your jurisdiction so while i was in the assembly i had uh then senator leno had tried to you know create some open records for police and i voted for that bill at least two times and he was never successful and so when i got in the senate people approached me and i felt like yeah we need to keep this is uh it s important for good policing good public safety and good community relations and it s just it s it s the right thing to do so i did carry that bill sb1421 and i was successful and i really was pleased and again it was a very huge team effort and my colleagues supported it and then we ve subsequently expanded with some other categories of records so it s still limited access around other public employees you can get much more information so it s limited access you can get about officers behavior but at least it s the core things that you know core misconduct like if an officer has um uh been dishonest on the job tampered with evidence interfered with the witness and also around if they ve if they ve engaged in excessive violence or discriminatory behavior so now california residents can feel confident they can get that information you know you had a unique experience kind of starting the assembly when you know the budget was tough it was difficult to negotiate there were no surpluses and now you re kind of in this you know the last few years we ve had surpluses and you know money to spend with the state and now you know as you a budget chair in the senate uh you know how has it been working on the budget this last year and you know with this year s surplus around 40 billion and maybe more kind of what s the senate and kind of your thoughts on the budget uh coming up here in 2022 sure so yes when i got elected in the assembly 2008 double whammy number one the recession california s revenues were just evaporating it was awful we had like a 60 billion dollar deficit 60 billion and we had to cut schools to the point where they were you know we already california was already the lowest per pupil funder of its public schools and it was very uh we became like mississippi it was terrible and we had the requirement that you had to get a two thirds vote to approve the budget we did not have a super majority of democrats so we had to negotiate with the republicans and you know hey bipartisan effort is always good but the problem with that particular kind of negotiation is the republicans would hold the budget hostage and we wouldn t get budgets passed it was a very traumatic experience now last year this year as budget share we have revenues in excess of 60 billion dollars the complete opposite the highest revenues we ve ever ever seen the highest per pupil funding um ever california s received and getting up into more than you know up to like i don t know in where we are in the rest of the states but above 25 other states in terms of per pupil funding which is great and the irony of this is partly it s we have great revenues because the stock market did so well and because we have some very wealthy californians and our progressive tax structure allows us to collect healthy amounts of revenue from those people who are doing very very very well but we also have a huge inequity problem we have a lot of californians who are struggling and you know what we call the middle class it s very difficult to be middle class in california now with the cost of housing and such and people that are in the poverty you know at or below poverty level is very high in california and that s just you know for me as a progressive democrat that i i can t see how we can be the fifth largest economy and i m now talking state of california fifth largest economy in the world and that we would have this level of poverty and income inequity so um state senate in the democratic caucus have um we ve really tried to to look at how do we put california s wealth to work for an equitable economy how do we lift up in all the boats so it s been great to be budget chair in that kind of context and last year we were able to make california the first state to provide every public school student two free meals a day at school so that is a great thing so we do not have to worry about kids coming to school hungry and not being able to learn or you know having that difficulty they re they re fed if they choose to be and that was a incredible thing to be able to pull off in last year s budget and i m looking forward to good things this year you know as you said you know there s been a lot of talk about housing in california i know that s something you focused on especially in your district where you know housing is so tough to come by kind of what are you seeing in the housing space right now and kind of what else can you guys do to kind of make housing more affordable here in california well housing is really when i think about what are our big challenges the pandemic kovid s ongoing the climate crisis huge challenge is not going away and housing because we have california has not built enough housing for decades and when you have a shortage like we have a growth in population a growth in jobs in certain of our job centers but not a growth in housing then that makes that commodity very expensive so each unit of housing that s there is very expensive and then with just construction costs have gone up materials cost supply costs labor costs so building new housing is also expensive and what what that does to us is make housing really unaffordable for most californians so we have to build a lot more and we have to provide subsidy so that a good amount of that housing can be affordable housing when we think about our homelessness crisis it is very much because of a shortage of housing and that shortage leading to these high costs those you know the vast vast majority of people who are unhoused living on our streets they would never have chosen to that is not their chosen lifestyle and many of them were living you know had a regular roof over their heads less than two years ago less than three years ago um and our californians so that s something that a lot of my colleagues and i have been very committed to i m very happy to see the governor committed to it last year we put 2 billion towards 4 billion total 2 billion each year towards the very affordable housing the homeless housing we put another couple of billion towards you know other types of affordable housing and i look forward to continuing that type of investment again this year plus we passed lots of legislation that made it easier to get housing approved yeah have you started seeing any benefits of your sb 330 kind of being implemented yet by local governments yes two of the big success stories of our housing bills and i m talking about the legislature as a whole one of them was our adu bills the accessory dwelling units and the most recent bill that was successful was assembly member tings i was a co author actually it had been my bill the year before but we uh anyway typical what happens is sometimes a bill gets hung up in a year so then you join forces with another colleague the following year and that bill basically gave the green light to almost any and every single family home in california to be able to build at least one if not more accessory drilling units and basically their local government s not able to tell those um owners not being able to tell them no so in other words you can t now say no you can t do an adu so what we ve seen in los angeles the largest number of units of new housing construction over the last three to four years have all been these accessory dwelling units now many of them are up to like 800 square feet to a thousand square feet so they re not just for a college student or a single person there you know there are units that uh can accommodate you know a number of people so that s been a great great success story and then my bill sb 330 basically said look local governments you ve already done all your zoning you ve done your eirs for that zoning and if an application comes into your door that meets your existing rules you have to limit the amount of time that you process that limit the number of public hearings and give it a green light because if they ve met what you ve asked them to meet we need that housing built so sp 330 um really has we ve uh my staff and i we haven t necessarily documented everyone but we re we re constantly being informed by a different jurisdiction or a different project you know entity that is building some housing like hey yeah we this housing is now going through because of sp 330 we were you know we ve been trying to get a permit for three years five years whatever but we got the green light as soon as 3 30 came through and we re seeing much more housing as a result and that s a great thing yeah you know the last week the big news was single payer health care that they re working on over there in the assembly kind of what are some of your thoughts on how california could implement a single payer health care and pay for it well single payer is the most efficient form of delivery of health care and it cuts out a lot of the um administrative costs or middleman as you might call that is making our healthcare expensive um but it s also can be costly eventually it doesn t have to be so costly but setting up the structure of it now in the meantime and there s obviously many good arguments for that for that type of system of healthcare and most other um economies of the size of california have that now interestingly with the governor s the budget that he proposed on january 10th and his offer that we would provide medi cal to every californian who is eligible regardless of their circumstance that under that context with the combination of the affordable care act and what we have done with medi cal and with of course medicaid our seniors already get really if we were to pass what the governor has presented to us in the budget january 10th then we would have healthcare as an accessible for every californian now there is that question that undercover california some californians who this employer doesn t provide it for them have the cost involved but we ve kept that cost much lower than most states so there s still some affordability issues but basically california would have achieved if we approve that budget that he s proposed we would have health care access to every california and i i guess you know why is that i guess not enough i guess for some advocates that you know they want a whole new scale system well there s you know time there s a lot of issues around again cost of health care and these different layers that add costs and whether single payer eventually could trim that down there s also the question of you have under a medi cal system you ve got some practitioners who won t take a medi cal patient so that can put a person at a disadvantage um so those are some of the difficulties even with the good things that we have done so far in california yeah you know global warming has always been a concern and something that you know you ve helped uh to work on uh in your time here in the scent in the assembly kind of what are the some of the things you re working on now and i know you re working on some carbon sequestration you know why is that an answer to help kind of some of the global warming concerns we have well the climate crisis is well underway and we already have way too much carbon way too much global warming gases in our atmosphere and while we have to stop emissions even stopping emissions which is not going to happen overnight is not going to bring the temperatures down to the levels or avoid the catastrophic climate change that we need to avoid we need to get some of that carbon that s up there out and i know that some advocates feel that anything that you if we move towards any types of carbon sequestration that that s just like a path for justifying fossil fuels but you know it doesn t have to be a path for justifying fossil fuels it really can be a path for getting carbon out and buying us some time as we transition off the fossil fuels so the the um one of the bills i ll be working on this year my colleague senator becker put new requirements on our cement industry and so cement is a very uh very polluting from a climate point of view um i don t want cement necessarily cement manufacturing to leave california so because we we produce cleaner cement than almost anywhere else so if we can assist them and pilot some carbon capture at our cement facilities then we can see how carbon sequestration works whether we can capture some there and we can assist that the cement manufacturing so that s one of the things i m looking at oh interesting you know you re never one to shy away from anything you know we ve covered a lot of things here today but you know what else are you looking you know towards you know doing this year with your legislation package um good questions i m uh green hydrogen so one of the fuels that could really help us in the climate crisis is non fossil based hydrogen um and we can use we can use our solar resources when we re producing more solar than we need we could use it to produce hydrogen and then hydrogen could be used to fuel power plants fuel vehicles lots of things but we need to create the right market signals to drive that non fossil based hydrogen so that s one of the things i m looking at but the other thing i m really excited about are you know i mentioned early in our conversation about the inequity in california so we have a lot of kids who uh children who are in poverty level um and that s being exacerbated now by the pandemic we had many many california children 20 000 estimate who lost their parent or caregiver to covet so now they ve had a death and if they were low income already if their family was low income and then they have a parent that might have been the an income earner who s passed away the federal government provides some survivor benefits but when those kids turn 18 who you know where s where s their support so i have introduced a bill that would create hope accounts for the low for the children who lost a parent to covid who s in from a low income family so that when they turn 18 they have some money that they can look to to help them whether it s pursue their education pursue training put the first and last month deposit just give them that hope that the rest of us usually rely on our families for and then we also want to use those hope accounts for our um children that are in long term foster care because if you re in long term foster care that means you don t have parents you can rely on so that s the other concept within our hope accounts so i m very excited about that well i know i know you need to go you re a busy woman and doing big things so thank you so much for taking the time and joining us and we look forward to seeing what you re up to this year and hopefully we can catch up on with you later well it was great fun and thank you for inviting me

commissioners and that was a mistake thank you the state of california and governor newsom has prioritized the corporate health over the victims of pg e s wildfires why was pg e invited in to the governor s office is it fair to say pg e s influence with the governor got them protection and reward in the face of crimes yes music california s burning crisis costs all of us to solve it we have to master the three core elements fire power money as the entire town of paradise evacuated a retired cal fire dispatcher drove toward the flames i knew people were dying i really hoped it wasn t anybody i knew but i knew people were dying just driving up music it was worse than the big fire steve bradley trained four years ago as a volunteer firefighter in paradise on his way up he called his mom and his grandma colleen i ll see you soon love you bye that was the last time i talked to her music we were getting used to the idea of her moving in with us you know not to losing her grandma colleen s daughter muriel had a room ready but even at age 96 colleen wasn t ready to move in yet she kept putting it off because she didn t want to give up her independence up by the fire steve had to stop at the roadblocks his mom made it out but nobody heard from grandma colleen i looked up and i knew where my grandma s house was and just watching the fire march down the hill towards chico ethel colleen riggs joined the list of hundreds missing next morning her name showed up at an evacuation site i had the picture still her name s on the board i was ecstatic i thought i found her i found a nurse to help me she came back out music and she said she was in there and i knew just like that i knew you know that was the last hope this is grandma colleen s house investigators found her remains cremated in her own laundry room that s just one family s horror my little sister my father was found in the bathroom didn t want to die she s hiding in her house pg e admitted to killing all these people this is the hook that killed 84 people these hooks are what are holding the electrical lines off the ground and pg e s decision was simply just to let these things hang until they broke because it saved them money apparently they knew they knew those power lines weren t safe and they d known for years and just didn t do anything guilty of 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter negligence a reckless disregard for life and you re sitting across from me telling me but we have it hasn t sounded an alarm yeah that s the problem nobody s taking any of these things seriously enough if it were me i would have been in jail a long long long time ago but pg e gets a pass because they re a corporation corporations can t go to prison we take no pride in the fact that the the punishment is so little instead of 90 years behind bars the judge sentenced pg e to pay the maximum fine under california law ten thousand dollars per victim killed we are not holding these people accountable and we do have mechanisms to hold them accountable mike ramsey at least got them to admit that they killed all those people and what should have happened at that point that s when the system should have kicked in you are a killer corporation do you understand that that means something in terms of with regulatory agencies with governor s offices with legislatures has it really meant something has pg e s reputation as a convicted killer actually earned it stricter treatment from the people in charge of its state monopoly license our nearly three year long investigation reveals the opposite the state government did more than just help pg e avoid accountability governor gavin newsom s administration responded to pg e s crimes by offering the company reward and protection the governor doesn t want to talk about it he s declined or ignored every interview request we ve sent dating back to his time as governor elect and the state is still rewarding pg e even though pg e is already under more criminal investigations cal fire personnel on the site brought to his attention and then our attention what appears to be a broken jumper on one of our transmission towers for starting two more fires that burned homes the zog fire killed four people even after those fires california state government gave pg e this an official state safety certificate this is more than a label it s worth money big music across money with mega jackpots it s mega millions music let s see if i can make you a billionaire tonight that is the draw for the biggest single winning lottery ticket in us history just two weeks before the campfire 1 5 billion dollars if pg e starts another fire that big this safety certificate could be worth 10 times more money than that the safety certificate lets pg e and the two other big investor owned power companies tap into a 21 billion dollar state insurance fund half paid for by utilities and half paid by the customers through a surcharge on power bills for 20 years utilities in the fund can start a big fire negotiate a settlement with the victims and get this state fund to pay those victims out the signature on pg e s first safety certificate belongs to alice stebbins i didn t i did not want to sign this stebbins was executive director of the california public utilities commission pg e s state regulator what would you say to the people of paradise that i m sorry she turned whistleblower and cleaned out her desk fired by the puc s five commissioners is it fair to say pg e s influence with the governor got them protection and reward in the face of crimes i think that s fair assessment yes i do how did it work through ab1054 ab 1054 is the state law that created the safety certificates signed by governor gavin newsom who benefited from more than 200 thousand dollars in political donations from pg e have you reconsidered giving the money back to pg e that they contributed to your campaign no i i my actions the suggestion is somehow contributions have changed actions took what i just passed the law the governor is pointing at gave pg e a safety certificate for making a plan to be safe but it didn t actually require pg e to be safe that s not how the bill started we obtained documents the public rarely gets to see draft versions of the safety certificate bill weeks before it was revealed to state lawmakers these documents show the law was crafted by omelvany and myers the law firm governor newsom hired to represent him in pg e s bankruptcy payment records show that law firm charged the taxpayers three million dollars during the six months when the law took shape financial firm guggenheim also helped create the governor s new law billing taxpayers 3 7 million dollars the state has a whole agency dedicated to writing bills we asked the governor why he hired private firms to do it instead but the governor s office didn t answer at the time the bill was being drafted pg e hadn t pleaded guilty to the camp fire crimes yet but the company was already a convicted felon that the judgment was strong but you know it s never enough because i can never get my family back serving time on probation for the deadly san bruno gas explosion that s why when the bill was being debated any questions we pressed the governor for answers about pg e s money pg e was convicted of a federal of six federal felonies in 2016 after that you took more than two hundred thousand dollars to help get elected how should people trust you to be running the show to come up with the solution i um i wish you luck with whatever you re working on but uh that s a strange question you asked that question before you knew what he was doing former san diego city attorney mike aguirre represents pg e customers fighting the company s bailout he uncovered calendar entries things like meet and greets with pg e s leaders at the governor s office in the weeks when the governor s bill was being crafted kills her your honor 84 times they said guilty your honor and yet there was a disconnect between that and being shown in the front door at the governor s office and being given special legislation and special protection why why was pg e invited in to the governor s office alice stebbins says ab 1054 made pg e s safety certificate automatic the bottom line was i was told to sign it you will sign this period the governor s bill did create a new wildfire safety division to work with utilities our investigation reveals though the governor s lawyers watered the bill down as they revised the language they chipped away that new agency s power to enforce safety to get a safety certificate this early draft would have made utilities earn a positive safety determination from the agency two days later the authors struck out determination and made it only a staff recommendation by the time state lawmakers got to see the bill even that language was gone to get its first safety certificate the final law only made pg e do four things all of them on paper out in fire country stebbin says the law made pg e do nothing did it have to trim trees well they should have but no no did they have to go out and inspect their hooks and replace old equipment to get the certificate they should have for the extensive benefits that a company gets from having a safety certificate it should come with the accountability nat skinner heads safety for the puc s own consumer advocate office pg e s safety certificate worries him so it makes it harder to hold the utility accountable before the governor s bill power companies couldn t build the cost of wildfire damage to their customers unless they proved they acted prudently or reasonably the governor s bill changed the rules it automatically deems a power company reasonable if it has a safety certificate more than that even if someone manages to prove the utility was unreasonable in causing a fire the governor s bill capped how much it could hurt the shareholders profits even if they weren t prudent yes why on earth would we want to cap how much the utilities would have to pay back to the wildfire fund if they were wrong in causing the fire to protect the utility so if this had been in place during the 17 18 and 19 fires pg e shareholders would have been on the hook for about four billion dollars not for the tens of billions that they ve ultimately ended up paying out and that s what the certificate gets them yes they could cause another campfire potentially and not have to go bankrupt this time yes i think that s obscene i don t understand why this is allowed why they get the safety certificate they get to self insure and they get to set up the rules that don t benefit anybody but themselves in a written response to our reporting governor newsome s office pointed out the law required pg e to spend money on safety upgrades money that a federal judge says the company should have spent years ago instead of draining its safety budgets to pay out bigger profits newsome s office ignored all our specific questions about the much bigger amount of money that law gave to the safety certificate program the government has made it more of a priority for pg e to come out okay than the victims of pg e and i just why music you,"bailout,prison,corporation,draft,taxpayers,criminal,health,shareholders,safety,law,special

debate a show for political eclectics i m robbie gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlott well corey what do we have today well we got a pax show today democracy is in decline around the world according to new analysis we ll talk about the reasons why a new front in the crt school fight why you might be hearing a lot more about curriculum transparency this year and finally police arrest two hackers accused of laundering over four billion dollars worth of stolen bitcoin all the weird details surrounding that story but first things first last week twitter and several mainstream media outlets piled on comedian dave chappelle headlines claim that chappelle helped kill an affordable housing plan in his ohio hometown a video also surfaced of shepell appearing at his local village council with an ultimatum hi i m dave spell i just want to say and marianne i can talk to you about this privately um i don t know why the village council will be afraid of litigation from a 24 million a year company while it s out the 65 million a year company i cannot believe you would make me audition for you you look like clowns i am not bluffing i will take it all off the table that s all thank you so was dave really trying to kill an affordable housing plan well after diving into the village s meeting minutes videos local news sources and the developers proposal we found this story to be much more complicated as it turns out the developer who was trying to rezone the property just north of chappelle s house to build what is called a planned unit development never set out to build any affordable housing on its 53 acres instead the developer had plans to donate 1 75 acres to the village for future affordable housing so did the mainstream media get this story horribly wrong uh what is going on with chappelle here i have a few uh embarrassing things to to point out here i think number one is that i had even before the scandal i ve gone on zillow and looked up housing prices in this town because i m like addicted to using zillow just to like travel the world and i was like oh i wonder what a house costs in chappelle s uh neighborhood so that s number one number two is i think the story is like a window into how we as a society and especially media treat these kinds of stories is like this is a town of 3872 people tiny and it s gotten so much attention where you know there s a moment this morning where i was researching for this segment where i was looking at traffic patterns sewage electric in this random town in ohio and i just stepped back and i was like wait a minute um i live in soho new york one of the biggest nimby areas that s ever been created in society and not only that i helped elect a city council member my buddy chris marteau shout out to him who is the most nimby city council member in new york city right now fights every development that comes into this neighborhood and so i was like maybe i should examine my my own practices here it s why we actually did an episode of conor doherty at the new york times from the new york times a couple of episodes ago of regressives where he talked through uh some of these challenges that progressives have where we oppose uh development and it leads to you know increased scarcity of houses increase prices and why that s bad but as you pointed out like this is complicated we don t know what s in chappelle s heart there it seems like there are many reasons why you could have opposed this thing and what i would ask people is take some of that energy that you re you re bringing to chappelle and maybe figure out what s going on in your neighborhood down the street from you and maybe examine and change your practices that s certainly what i m trying to do here definitely and i think that this is kind of symptomatic of a larger phenomenon that we re all kind of guilty of when a story comes out and it s somebody that you might like or you don t like and you initially kind of have you re you re a little more willing to accept the negative story about someone that you already don t like and i think that that s kind of what happened on twitter and with the media rolling stone had a headline dave chappelle s latest achievement helping kill an affordable housing development which was pretty ad hominem and i think it s worth noting that like we ve been talking about the story since last week here at the lost debate and we spent a lot of time doing our due diligence and pouring into these minutes and trying to figure out what actually is happening here and it turned out to be a lot more complicated than these sort of like quick flashy headlines have to say and even i would say as someone who works in journalism most journalists don t even have control over what that headline says and so when we have these sort of ad hominem attacks like this with a situation like chappelle there s actually a lot more of meat behind the story and we actually pulled a second clip that hasn t been getting as much circulation that gives a lot more context to what chappelle is talking about i just want to say i m adamantly opposed to it obviously i live behind the development for the proposed development i do have many business interests in town i ve invested millions of dollars in town if you push this thing through what i m investing in is no longer applicable and i would say that over it can come and buy all this property from me if they want to be your benefactor the average age in the village is 49 years old without a school you will not attract young families and this city will not live beyond the retirees that decide to settle here and i m surprised that marianne mcqueen is is suddenly not averse to change because you always are when i uh uh propose a change and now all of a sudden we have to recognize the change these changes are inevitable but we do have a decision on what they will or could be and i think we should use more of a visionary i uh i instead of a reactionary one because the potential of this place is immense and over is not the only solution so i think this clip this clip comes from december so this is a much deeper debate than just this one meeting that went viral and i think it s worth noting that he s saying there s an inevitability to creating affordable housing in some sense but that this specific model that was being applied might not be the best solution yeah there was something he said at the end of this that i want to point out he said we should use more of a visionary eye instead of a reactionary one because the potential of this place is immense and ober which is the developer is not the only solution i want to underline that statement this means that he is i think and a lot of these people are against all of this like and i think i could quibble with their strategy to oppose this you know particular zoning or that zoning and say this may lead to less affordable housing or the others but my sense from chappelle in this clip is he doesn t want any of this he doesn t it s not that he s against affordable housing necessarily i m not in his heart but he s just like i don t want this development period uh that was my sense of this clip yeah it s really interesting i think people saw this proposal and saw like the words affordable housing and how now if the proposal wasn t going through then the affordable housing was going through and they just cherry picked that and turned it into this larger argument about affordable housing but as we ve already talked about the plan only allowed it 1 75 acres which is nothing which is nothing yeah i mean to hear it s a lot but yeah it s got to be nothing i know you know because i was looking at yeah you were looking at that you were trying to get that pretty cheap yeah yeah and also too there was no plan in their proposal to actually build affordable housing it was like we re going to donate this land to the village and they can eventually figure out how to build affordable housing here at some point years in the future so it s not like he was physically killing affordable housing it all it almost reminds me of like high school when like you if there was anything you know get edited again well marianne s at it again but also too it reminds me like if you were somebody in high school that you didn t like and you heard a rumor about them that was just salacious and everything like that you d be like oh i could totally believe that because that guy s a jerk so yeah that s what this is kind of it just sounds like all of the people the detractors here who hate chapelle they piled onto the story because of previous things that they didn t like about shapel but it had nothing to really do with this tiny town s actual politics you know yeah well before we go on corey walk us through this visual that that you helped create with the help of our team just to give a sense of chappell s why chappelle is particularly animated about this development well i m not going to take credit for this we have we have a wonderful editor and producer here nick who helped who helped make this uh picture and basically as you can see on your screen right now yeah for those who are at the listening a lot of those listening this is we re basically showing what the development would look like and it is it is like literally when we say in chapel s backyard it is in his backyard and if you re watching if you re not watching we have chappelle s head basically where his house would be and then the literally there is no space between the top of his head and the bottom of the development there s literally like i mean i don t know what it s what the scale would be but i mean that s like less than an inch for sure and so this this is clearly clearly this was going to be in his backyard and clearly there was a lot at stake here for him and he just didn t want these this proposal in the background again i don t see any affordable housing a lot i don t even know where the 1 758 would be in this in this setup it s important to know that what would be in his backyard is the development not the affordable component right yeah because it does it does it it s not there well yeah we ll throw this up on our instagram for the podcast listeners uh so that they can they can check out this nifty graphic i think one thing just to close the book on this is hopefully this we can use this story to educate people about some of like the affordable housing issues around this country and so for example there was this debate around uh well there s only luxury homes going in here and that s one example of of an issue and trend that i would pull out and say all right well that s relevant for people everywhere if you live in san francisco seattle new york et cetera often people uh like my councilman will be like this is a luxury tower and therefore it s not gonna make an impact on affordable housing and what i have heard credible critics say back is well there s a downstream effect if you build more luxury houses then the the uh apartments houses wherever you live uh downstream from that will become more affordable over time if you just increase the overall stock kind of sounds like trickle down economics yeah well it will you could think about it in new york right for example like like a lot of these apartments that we re running now were way way way cheaper before right so it s not like there s any fancy components to these apartments it s just that their value keeps going up because of the scarcity right so i think like so like let s say you build this quote unquote luxury apartments down the street from here and you double the supply in soho uh then theoretically though places like where we are right now where my apartment would be cheaper that s that s an argument now they re probably good counters to that but i think like if we get out of this debate like a more nuanced version of these debates around the country that would be improvement i would say yeah and i think this is just one of those examples where you just can t take a headline at face value you have to do some research actually go in and find out what s really going on before you you know try to crucify a pretty decent comedian now on to our next story democracy is on the decline around the globe just under 46 of the world s population lives in a democracy down from 49 4 in 2020 the 2021 report by the economist intelligence unit sets a record low score for democracy around the world in the biggest one year drop they ve recorded since 2010 the reasons for democracy s global decline are complex socio political trends pandemic aftershocks stress on the global economy and conflicts around the world just to name a few but the overall takeaway is pretty clear democracy is not strong in the world right now so let s take a look at this from different perspectives ricky uh the united states prize itself has a strong democracy we we talk about spreading democracy around the world usually by force but are we really holding up true democratic values right now well according to this analysis it seems like we re on the decline um we ve been deemed a flawed democracy we re number 26 worldwide our neighbors in the ranking are chilly in estonia just to give a sense like not i don t think most people would have expected that as american citizens um and the categories that they break down are elect the electoral process political participation uh civil liberties the functioning of government and political culture and the places where we had huge losses our political culture and functioning of government and i think you know in terms of the functioning of government it s pretty obvious to anyone living in this country um with january 6th with the russian collusion narrative like it s gone from bad to worse in terms of people not trusting our democracy for a variety of reasons on a variety of sides of the political spectrum um leading up to the 2020 election one in five partisans on either party believed that violence was at least a little bit justified if their party lost which is super frightening um we have the issue with gerrymandering and the way that our two party system has kind of incentivized politicians to be at the most extreme versions of their parties the large and i feel growing middle of the country is not being represented politically and our parties keep driving further and further apart and then in terms of the issues of political culture i think that s pretty obvious that s essentially why we re here and we have this company is because we have a partisan media we have social media that s driving people further and further apart i d imagine that the pandemic and locking down and really only getting information and not talking to people through these lenses made things even worse and we re at a place where 53 of republicans say they have democrat friends and 32 percent of democrats say that they have republican friends so we re not talking to the other side we re we re afraid to air our beliefs a lot of mainstream beliefs are considered beyond the pale almost two thirds of americans say they re not comfortable speaking their minds politically in some contexts and so if the issues that are on the table for our country to be grappling with can t even be discussed i m i m not surprised to see that we re lowering in the rankings yeah that political culture number really jumps out to me uh the there was this data from this uh varieties of democracy institute and they ve been tracking data from 1980 to 2020 and they rank regions and countries on a zero to four scale and zero means that political groups interact in a friendly matter manner and four means that they interact in a hostile manner and what s really interesting to me is that around 1980 we were around 1 5 on that scale meaning we re relatively friendly with people who have different beliefs in us and now we re approaching four so uh that means that we ve gone from friendly to hostile in my lifetime because i m older than both of you uh and that s really scary and i think a lot of us who ve been around long enough can feel it right like political discussions uh especially i trace this back to pre iraq war used to be fun like you would be able to debate about the tax rate and you you know like everything felt like almost like a west wing episode and now if everything feels so existential and hostile and personal and nobody s trying to persuade each other anymore and ricky i want to underline what you said this is why we start this company it s like we have a theory that there actually is a group of people out there who are dying for nuanced discussion they don t want to be manipulated they don t want to fly a flag they may have like strong beliefs when they go to the ballot box and so like they may be averse to like you know fake balance but they want people to actually try to figure out the issues in real time with some some attempt at objectivity yeah but it s not just a problem in america i mean this is globally we re seeing a drop in this the democracy index i know you were doing some research about india and you were just you were telling me some crazy stats about what s going on in their government because technically they are a democracy but they re considered a flawed democracy like us and so tell me a little bit what s going on over there yeah the the the economist who also put together this report had a separate article in the same issue called and the titleist article was the organs of india s democracy are decaying and if you look into this data it s really scary india strangely in this past year went up in this ranking but over the past few years has dropped pretty precipitously and there was this one data point that really blew my mind and this is from the association for democratic reforms they say that a record 43 percent of members of parliament who won seats in the 2019 general election in india had been charged with a crime 43 percent 29 were booked for grave offenses such as rape and murder so that s a 109 increase from the cohort 10 years earlier and here s the kicker uh a candidate with a criminal record is three times more likely to win than one without so crime is literally paying in india this is a country with 1 38 billion people the world s largest democracy and so this report which you know focuses a lot on china and china s rise and its influence uh is now being we have that problem but then at the same time our world s largest democracy is decaying and as ricky described um you know the world s most powerful democracy is decaying as well and this is troubling that s very troubling the fact that you re three times more likely to get elected than any if you ve committed a crime is insane to me and this report also details just the fact that it s not only so much so that the countries that were already like authoritarian regimes you know they re remaining that of course but also that the strongest symbols of democracy in places like north america and western europe they re starting to slip in these scores and i think that s what s so troubling but also like you said uh you mentioned the china problem and that s a big part of this because china has been so successful economically speaking over the last three decades and that was not supposed to happen with a communist country like they were supposed to go the way the soviet union did and instead they ve done the exact opposite they ve actually been expanding their economy a lot faster than we have been doing in the united states they have the second largest gdp in the world right now and a lot of people are saying that that s the reason why democracy globally is looking less flattering uh i i ve heard things where people chinese leaders have said things like the western electoral democracy model produces inferior leaders time wasting deliberations and a lot of gridlock and when i read those things it kind of sounds like our congress yeah well the same issue is is true of india too the gridlock and and the economist points that out and there s this really awesome newsletter called cynosism um with an s and they uh they translate a lot of chinese news both like in the mainland but also uh you know chinese news abroad and uh what s really interesting what s really interesting to me is that the you know china chinese media which is you know controlled by the state or highly regulated by nothing s really being said without them being okay with it they re just repeatedly banks as strong they ve been doing it for years they ve been talking about how flawed we are they they they take every embarrassing weakness we have in our country and they continually bring it to their population say look see do you want that or do you want what we have right now and it just makes me ill because we re feeding the narrative by being so dysfunctional this is not to let them off the hook so i would much rather to state the obvious live in the united states than china just by a long shot much rather live in india than china but they re effectively uh using our own weaknesses against us so i mean this may be a loaded question but what can we do to help foster democracy and to help fix it because like you said when china says something like that when they have this a planned economy where they can they can plan things out 20 years ahead and they don t have to worry about some crazy election happening four years from now ruining that plan so how can we better uh do that here where we ll not necessarily plan everything out so ahead but how can we try to fix democracy to where it actually works institutions is supposed to be a good thing it has to be institutions like and that s why i think all of us are here and i think why media in particular is such a big important institution here like media in many ways is reflecting back our polarization and then making it worse and so that s why we do this here and one thing is worth pointing out is that canada because i know we have a lot of canadian listeners to the podcast especially is also declining and this report has you know is basically saying canada is starting to look more and more like the us in all of the worst possible ways obviously the trucker stuff is just a reflection of a larger slide happening in canada which is just really sad yeah and i think it also requires kind of like a societal rededication and redirection towards the tenets of democracy and you know i think as a young person seeing my generation the way that our attitudes towards different opinions towards free speech towards tolerating difference is in some ways on a deeper and more philosophical level really low and i think you know we re several generations away from the founding of these democracies like i mean nobody alive remembers the the need and necessity for freedoms in america for free speech for for these values that are so central and i think that our education system needs to recommit to to classical liberalism to pluralism to free speech to the values that are so fundamental and if that means civics education i think that s super important because how how will a generation of young people exercise the the rights and their freedoms that are required to live in a democracy like ours if they don t know what they are yeah there s like a ticket that you need to punch in a lot of neighborhoods around this country to even be in polite company and the the kinds of things that you need to do to jump through those hoops are getting more and more elaborate and i can speak of it from you know progressive new york for example like if you re uh if you re anti abortion uh if you re you know if you re like pro quote unquote police or anti reform of the police uh if you you know want to lower taxes i mean you start to go down this list and you ll say like if you have any of these beliefs uh you re not allowed in to this you know into the conversation to a friend group or whatever and i think that s i think super destructive uh and we re starting to like self segregate into ideological clans and that can t be good no absolutely not and in alabama it s the reverse like if you re if you re if you re pro abortion you wouldn t be allowed in that if you re against guns you wouldn t be allowed in certain groups so it s definitely a problem but ricky you mentioned education and that s actually uh what our next story is going to be about the fight over critical race theory in schools is moving to a new front curriculum transparency at least a dozen states have proposed legislation that would require teachers to post their lesson plans online now supporters say parents have a full right to the fullest possible picture of what their children are learning opponents say it piles on unnecessary bureaucracy on teachers and could quickly lead to censorship in the classroom our resident uh a former school principal here well you said it not me so that doesn t check the bingo cards can lead us in this discussion so what do you think about this idea of uh curriculum transparency so i think there are to take a step back about crt generally there are there are different sort of phases of this right there was the original term which was like this legal term that really wasn t in widespread use but most recently crt has come on it come to take on a much broader meaning that includes a whole bunch of different things and most recently and this was this was a big flashpoint in the virginia elections the crt debate centered a lot around the curriculum being used in the classrooms and the trainings of teachers and we ll get to you know some of the hotter debates about that today but essentially they re pulling curriculum out of classrooms and trainings and saying this curriculum is you know either trying to say that you know to use immutable characteristics to describe students and separate them or tell them to feel guilty about who they are or you know that kind of stuff um and then there was this second wave which is the book banning stuff that we ve covered before where uh parents uh elected officials etc are trying to pull books off of shelves and as we ve reported on and many others have the trend is is towards increased levels of activity there where more and more books are being pulled off the shelves so those are the two first phases now we re on this third phase which is the transparency phase where uh some you know prominent figures in this debate uh on the right are signaling that they re gonna be pushing one uh pieces of legislation around the country to say all right teachers got to put up their curriculum teachers uh need to um talk about what books they re using ahead of time and the strategy here is very transparent so christopher ruffo who s like the in many ways people describe as like the father of this modern strategy from the right on curriculum transparency um basically did a tweet storm where he described in detail uh what they re planning to do and so and i ll come back to those tweets in a second but it s just very clear this is a debate where they re trying to get liberals to oppose transparency that s what that s what this is about interesting ricky i mean you re the person i think has been in school the the most recent out of all of us i mean what are some of the things that you ve seen um just from your experience about like the separation of people and things like that so i um i graduated in 2018 from my boarding school so i was in the private school sphere so i i don t really know in terms of the public education which is what s kind of in question here but um there was a recent wall street journal expose about associations of private school or independent schools and paul rossi who s actually a friend of mine listened to like hundreds of hours of kind of dei content and he personally thought that it was really divisive and you know just in in 2014 i was going back through um my school s community day that they held on martin luther king day where we had options of different lectures to go to and i pulled some of the titles for people who who wouldn t who i i if i wasn t if i didn t have this life experience i would look back at this and and all this debate and say well this sounds like a lot of mumbo jumbo and like maybe the crt thing is overblown or maybe there s not weird stuff going on in school well um bruce lee in asian masculinities examining and understanding male privilege inequality for all unpacking white privilege what is the role of skin color in society everyday sexism so these are lectures for a captive audience what grade were you in i was 14 at the time you looked like a freshman in high school freshmen in high school kids that are at a boarding school away from their family and like you i i m all for it s a private school they can do this but i m i m all for in a public setting k to 12 where these are government officials where they have a captive audience they have little kids in their care and we it s compulsory we have truancy laws and it s there they work for the government i m all for as much transparency as possible because there is weird stuff going on i m sure that you know i went to a woke boarding school that s probably different from your typical k 12 institution but you know there is there there is weird stuff it s worth worth pointing out yeah there was something in this article that really caught my attention and and it s it s worth mentioning that a lot of uh what i m about to say hinges on the author s interpretation of these videos and we reached out to them and we only reached out to them yesterday uh to just ask like for the primary source material so we ll report back if we get that because that would confirm some of the things i m saying here uh but one thing that they found and i ve seen other examples of this from around the country but they say that within this training that they viewed perfectionism punctuality urgency niceness worship of the written word progress objectivity rigor individualism capitalism and liberalism are some of the characteristics of white supremacy culture in need of elimination now i ve seen this kind of stuff around the country and it rhymes a little bit with actual things that people like teach for america were pushing at the time when i was working in schools and my problem here is punctuality so you re saying like showing up on time that s racist in and of itself to say that that s white supremacy or um objectivity the written word like you re telling people who were working in k 12 schools that the written word is white supremacy well we have to take that with a grain of salt because this is one person s observation of these things and these are the adjectives they decided to describe these things with i could see how some of these things i mean like punctuality everybody needs to be on time obviously however there is something called cp time uh no no i won t get into that um but uh and then and then the whole thing with uh just a joke about am i allowed to laugh at that we might have to cut that one out and then um and then but but this but this idea i can make that joke uh this idea that um there was another one you know the the written word well that may come out of this idea that certain people who are not white may speak in a different dialect may use a different diction than what is used normally and that not necessarily going against proper english but saying that the inclusion of other ways of speaking should be at least explored in these school settings so i just think we have to take that kind of stuff for granted yeah that s where the primary source i think would be really helpful and that s where i step outside and say well what is this does this check out to use ricky s example like of her experience and then my experience in schools and and i would say this is part of a broader movement to weaken things like curriculum standards standardized tests the emphasis on math and reading which i felt this viscerally where like a lot of people from that sort of dei camp were saying that emphasis on math reading writing uh were in some ways like propagating the capitalist system racism yadda yadda and i just think that it s easy for you to say you know people who have all the privilege that you know making sure kids can read and write is racist because if but if your kid came in and wasn t able to read on grade level or write on grade level it would be a you know a massive massive emergency for a lot of these families absolutely you know yeah i mean i m certainly not uh advocating that we don t make kids reading right yeah and we certainly should have rigor in in schools but some of the things that these these republican legislators are proposing to go against crt are are really insane to me in florida there was a bill being proposed that would put cameras in the classroom to monitor kind of like a big brother style surveillance of classrooms in mississippi there are talks of live streaming kids class i don t know anybody who would send their kids to school that s working they re not gonna have time to watch the live stream of their kids class there s a state rep named doug ritchie a republican in missouri that is proposing a bill that would require schools to post all teacher training materials online in addition to descriptions of what is being taught and then his claim is if schools are doing things right they shouldn t have to fear this legislation but i mean that could be said about gun control well if you re not a criminal you shouldn t have you fear god you can say that about it about anything yeah you could they could audit my finances every day and use that argument right now and be like well what do you have to worry about exactly so here s and this is i think really important there s a there s a line uh that a lot of these legislators are crossing and let s talk about one side of the line first which is i think the stuff that i think is legitimate about transparency so i i think it s helpful for schools when they post the curriculum being used in the classroom in a way that parents can access you know because that allows parents to help their kids it allows them you know other parents to collaborate if i were designing a system i would i would provide an easy way for teachers to provide that transparency without like you know onerous requirements that it needs to be up that very day and that it needs to you know in that like uh like every single little piece of paper needs to be up there right but there you could probably keep it manageable a lot of good schools already do this and i would also provide an opportunity for parents to collaborate because often what happens is parents are buying materials or creating materials or figuring things out about how to help their kids but they re not talking to each other so a well designed system would actually connect parents to actually help each other within the system but this is worth pointing out is like that s one side of the line when you cross over to this like surveillance stuff i think that s a problem and it belies the strategy here this is the the chris ruffo the guy i was talking about earlier this is like a tweet storm he had from january he said my goal this year is for 10 plus state legislatures to pass curriculum transparency bills requiring public schools to make all teaching materials easily available to parents via the internet it s time to get the political predators out of the shadows and return power to the families the strategy is to use non threatening liberal values like transparency to force ideological actors to undergo public scrutiny it s a rhetorically advantageous position and when enacted will give parents a powerful check on the bureaucratic power and then he goes on to talk about how he anticipates that the left is going to oppose this which has been happening um there was one legislator in wisconsin who put out a really tone deaf tweet about this and had to delete it terry mcqualified a quote from the gubernatorial election i think parents should be telling schools what they should teach so democrats are walking into this trap opposing transparency i think they need to be clear about the line say i m for some transparency but i want to make it manageable for teachers but i m not for cameras in the classroom i m not for teachers harassing parents harassing teachers and you know there s got to be some kind of balance here i mean to me though when you read that those tweets that s just acting in bad faith he s not doing this because he wants to allow parents to have a greater interaction with their children s education he s just doing it to get the liberals in a gotcha moment and force them to capitulate that s just that s just political engineering that s not that s not what is what good does this do for the children well i think it s worth pointing out that in the kind of contract of a public school teacher it they re serving in local parents which means in place of the parent and they therefore they re in sort of a pact i work at fire which is an organization that protects academic freedom and they they do point out that you know these codes between parent and teacher call for neutrality and impartiality when dealing with matters of contention in the classroom and so i while i don t like the the true surveillance aspects of these transparency bills i have no problem with with requiring that school curricular posted if a parent wants to sit down at the dinner table when they know that a contentious issue is discussed and say hey what d you learn at school today and this is how we as a family think about it and and internalize it i have no issue with that and i also you know i think there are versions of the spell these bills that are going overboard but at the same time i don t really agree that it s a big brother sort of situation i think it s what they re trying to facilitate is a way for little brother as the parents to see what big brother the government schools are actually doing and exposing their their children to and so i i while i don t advocate for the like live streaming stuff i think that is kind of weird i i don t have any issue with making teachers have their curricula be public i don t think there s any problem with the making it public i think the problem comes in when a parent has a problem with something that s in the curriculum yeah and then it becomes too easy to just overturn the lesson plan yeah this is going to lead to a la carte like bespoke education which is unmanageable we already have a teacher shortage in this country right now and the idea that uh this is where the the details really matter i m for certain parts of transparency like i talked about but we need to be clear with parents about what they can and cannot do in a public school because we don t have enough personnel to say all right you re out of this lesson and then johnny s out of the next one and then sarah s out of this one and then we need all these adults watching these other people we need to create all different sets of curriculum for different people uh and so that worries me and i think that in a lot of districts around this country this is going to be an inevitability and as somebody who yes you pointed out has been in there you will be surprised what people will object to they re like people who object to certain math problems like especially when the common core was happening like some parents were like this is ridiculous like um you know like this conceptual math is like you know an obama conspiracy or something and then you know am i supposed to opt your kid out of this this test because of that like that s crazy to me you know so that s what i m worried about so i i do think like you know my my advice to progress was here is embrace don t don t oppose transparency writ large but just tailor these things to make them sensible and you can actually leverage this to make schools better uh like even randy weingarten pointed out that good schools already do this so my point to her would be well if good schools already do it what can we do to make all schools do it yeah well that s a good point and hopefully this improves education in america and doesn t destroy it now on to a story about bitcoin two eccentric hackers with colorful backgrounds were arrested last week for conspiring to launder 4 5 billion dollars billion with a b worth of stolen bitcoin the bitcoin was stolen back in 2016 during a hack that target bitfinex a major crypto exchange at the time now the stolen money represented one sixth of all bitcoin trading value in the world at that point took officials over five years to track this married couple down the suspects ilya lichtenstein aka dutch and heather morgan to make it even weirder morgan is also a rapper she goes by the stage name razzlecon and she can be seen in music videos defending her title as the quote crocodile of wall street music okay um so naturally netflix ordered the rights for a documentary three days after the couple s arrest crypto has obviously come a long way since 2016 but critics say its primary use is still for crimes like this does this story back up that theory um ravi take me into the demented and savage world of razzle con all right so a couple things about this story one is this this couple especially uh what s her name heather heather is like it s almost like 20 21 as a person like is the only person who could only exist in the year 2021 it s like i i have a friend who says like you could like there s certain parts of new orleans where you will you could drop anybody in there at any point and you just there s only one city in america you could be in because it s just so unique this woman is she could there s no other possible time even early 2020 like it s just she is so specific to the time period we exist right now um so this movie is going to be amazing i think she has a long uh you know future in in federal prison ahead of her um you know and my brother you know he s a federal corrections officer maybe he ll get her yeah uh and we ll we ll get some stories about that but but i do think there s a couple things noteworthy to point out about the story number one is that she s out on bond how is that possible this is a billion dollar heist if there ever was uh and there may be some simple explanation for this but if there ever was an explanation uh a a data point to suggest that we need massive bail reform it s this because it s like what is the purpose of bail like at this point like why why would anybody else be stuck in prison what s the explanation for that and she s allowed out on a billion dollar heist talk about risk right like i mean obviously there s violent and non violent crime yeah but my assumption is that there s some non violent people s you know awaiting trial in in uh prison in jail that that s is puzzling to me the second thing is this question that you pointed out which is the use case debate right like why is this goofy story important uh because people use these examples to say all right bitcoin its primary use case is for criminal activity like this that s what people say and so we looked this up and so in 2021 the total transaction value for all cryptocurrency hit a record 15 8 trillion dollars so that was up 567 percent an estimated 14 billion of that cryptocurrency was used for l illicit transactions in 2021 so that actually represents an all time low and compared to the share of all total cryptocurrency so uh this is the lowest level of uh illegal transactions in cryptocurrency we ve ever had and uh i have like certain i m not a maximalist on cryptocurrency i think there are all sorts of questions that need to be answered about it but this whole criminal activity thing i think it hasn t borne fruit it certainly seems true of the early days like you know the the um american kingpin stuff like the silk road and all of that if you were following those stories but i don t think it s true anymore but also pablo escobar had you know warehouses full of cash like that didn t mean that cash was bad it just means that we need to have certain uh guidelines in place to to follow the flow of money congress is on it a little bit uh and the treasury has and and you know there are different parts of the treasury that have gone even further recently to say that uh certain exchanges are liable if they violate like foreign sanctions and there s like a very strict liability standard that we re using for this to say that even if you didn t even know you were facilitating a transaction that violates sanctions that you would be held liable so uh it seems that this stuff is tightening up and that criminal activity is uh relatively modest compared to the share of transactions of crypto definitely and i think that s symptomatic of crypto becoming so much more mainstream obviously there the percentage of criminal activity is still concerning but at the same time i think it s worth noting that in some contexts what is considered illegal activity in authoritarian countries might be things that we actually support in a way and i m not i don t know what the details are but you know there s there s countries like china and venezuela i know china now has crackdown on crypto but there are people that live under authoritarian repressive regimes that have no control over their financial uh independence or even like there is there s a um a big crypto guy out in barbados who said that he s now worth millions and millions of dollars because in barbados they don t have access to as as a whole to paypal to credit cards to online banking information and so this is a way that you know there there s obviously going to be shortcomings but this is a way that people can circumvent bad government and even dissidents that have their bank accounts frozen and stuff like that like this is a way potentially if it s facilitated properly and the loopholes like what this couple exploited get tightened up then this could be an avenue towards truly worldwide economic freedom for people yeah i think uh richie torres uh the congressman he made some points similar to that about remittances yeah yeah but when they talked about bitcoin uh uh in the house uh the rap video i don t think that uh did her any favors to heather morgan because in it she literally said shout out to the entrepreneurs and the hackers like yeah it s kind of like i don t know what it is about rap that leads people to like admit their crimes in it like yeah i have a feeling she s gonna be dead to rights without this video but she s also a former forbes contributor and she wrote like a ton of articles about um cyber security and stuff like she was just out in the open talking about exactly what she was doing this is gonna be a great netflix series i point out a couple things i want to just underscore what ricky you said because i hadn t thought about this like you know if you re somebody trying to escape north korea and you have to pay chinese nationals for instance to help smuggle you over the border and get to safety and all that and you re paying in crypto that s a great illegal use case of cryptocurrency and and cory we were talking about remittances is a big part of this debate like sending money back to your home country if you ve ever tried to facilitate these transactions it s like more paperwork than trying to adopt a child it s insane how hard it is to send money across borders and i understand why it s the case like we want to like be aware of illegal activity and prevent it but it shouldn t be this hard one thing i do want to mention there is certain kind of crypto crime on the rise there s this phenomenon called rug pulls which is a relatively new scam on which developers build these uh what appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency projects uh and they uh get you to like invest in it in like in a fraudulent way and then they take your assets to something i think i know some people like family members in the older side who you know the kind of people who respond to the sort of you know west african you know fake email that says you know i m your whatever cousin or whatever you remember like these things that used to come out um and it turns out they weren t in west africa i don t know why they picked nigeria all the time and uh and then they came away with your money um this is the new version of that you know are you guys old enough to get that reference did you get those you guys yeah yeah i ve gotten it before like i m gonna dream prince you have to help me oh yeah that s what it was i ve gotten those emails before yeah it always came from hotmail i m just wondering why that was the story but i know some people who it s versions of that fell for that and gave passwords away bank accounts things like that so that s crazy there s some dr phil episodes about it the irs never calls you it s tax season that s always happened to you i got a bunch of those yeah yeah for sure yeah they used to leave me voicemail saying this is the irs you are under arrest for not paying something and it was like there s a positive version of it now where they say you you re eligible for a refund so they re using positive framing now for these games interesting interesting flip there yeah yeah here s here s news people you tell the irs when you re eligible for a refund not the other way around they re not going to tell you that you re eligible for that money i don t think they have the bandwidth yeah so we have a little bit of an update on one of ravi s favorite podcasts uh breaking points i do like them i have to say like i i just want to i want to use the kind of energy and scrutiny they bring to msnbc to them uh okay it s because i i respect them so much so uh we had previously last week talked about a february seventh segment in which crystal ball and breaking points uh talked about how this emphasis on the rugen story is distraction from larger issues like inequality and things like that and mice we called it out saying like look there are a lot of segments that you re doing including the very segment they were in that appear to violate your principle you know whether it s talking about msnbc cnn gossiping about the news my sense was given i m sure they re avid listeners to the show that they would have heard our critique and and and changed their ways they did not um they have gone on to do four segments in the past three episodes on rogan uh including uh two segments in the very next episode on rogan and so just updating our listeners on this phenomenon if you are a listener and an avid commenter on the breaking points site you might might want to go over there and just point this out in a very polite way because i think every minute they spend on this it s not a minute they re spending on things like quantitative easing and explaining you know how the fed works or you know doing a deep dive into that inequality and i actually think they provide a huge value on that front and so i would just urge them again to uphold their whole standard i can already hear the comments saying well if you re worried about how much time they spend talking about rogan how much time do you spend talking about them talking about three minutes three minutes yes done and this will be the end of my breaking point since yes feedback is respect feedback is respect great well we thank you all

another episode of sac town talks today we have a great guest joining us assemblywoman blanca rubio joining us blanca how s it going thanks for joining us thank you for having me it s great um i was just saying that everybody thinks we re all just hanging out since we re on break but um the work for us hasn t stopped but it s all good can t complain that we re having a good good time yeah so i guess for those of us you know listening and here in sacramento who don t realize that things happen outside of sacramento can you kind of take us through a day in recess like what what is it like day to day for you now that you re you re out of session well day to day for us um really is you know a lot of work in the district um you know doing different events chambers of commerce we ve got i ve got a um a career fair coming up on saturday and so that s kind of the district work but i m back and forth from sacramento i don t know if you knew but my kids are uh go to school up here oh right and so it s it s uh for me it s a little bit more complicated than just going back and forth to the district i need a lot of support but fortunately i have my parents that are retired and they come up um help me you know while i have to go fly back and forth so this week has been kind of light last week uh i was gone uh monday and tuesday came back on wednesday was here on thursday i went back to the district on thursday night uh came back on saturday was here on sunday and then next week is you know kind of the same thing because i m trying to juggle you know the district responsibilities um you know people forget that we still have staff and and responsibilities up here so i ve been doing a lot of that and unfortunately fortunately and unfortunately part of what of what we do is uh making sure that we stay um you know relevant up here as well so we do a lot of the fundraising right now um you know just trying to catch up for me it s a lot of coffees and um just reacquainting myself with folks on a you know personal level not just legislative level so this is the time where i kind of reacquaint myself with you know relationships that i ve built up here so it s uh different for every everyone but of course like i said because of my children later today i have a a volleyball practice my daughter s in volleyball so she had a game yesterday she has a game tomorrow and so trying to juggle my personal responsibilities with the legislative responsibilities is always um hectic but you know this is my fifth year here so i kind of gotten used to it and definitely the children are used to it so they know i m like i don t even have to invite them anymore i m like hey guys gotta go to the district some and sometimes they ll say hey we re coming with and mainly since now i have a high school student and an eighth grade a ninth grader and an eighth grader they re like nah mom we re good go by you know go go home and you know we ll stay here for a little bit with uh my dad and my mom because they re you know they just have the choice of hopping on a plane with me and going to the district or staying here and hanging out with them grandma and grandpa and their friends wow so you re actually busier out of session than you are in session dad yes yes at least when i m in session you know i go to work at nine and you know i know that um i have a schedule at the you know in the building here it s like kind of i was in uh at the capitol twice yesterday one in the morning and then i came back i told you i had a game yesterday for my daughter came back for the game and then went back in the evening because i had other responsibilities to attend to but not complaining i got to tell you i m not complaining this is the best gig ever love what i do love being able to represent and being able to you know get some wins for the district yeah wow so i guess how was that i guess through the last what year i guess kind of dealing with you know kids at home and keeping this busy schedule okay so you know i m a former teacher and i just have to say god bless um teachers of course i was one of them but let me tell you i never really understood when i was a full time teacher i didn t really understand parents that homeschooled their kids i can tell you that i understand them even less now i don t know why you want to be with your children all day long i am a credentialed teacher and was still having a hard time trying to teach my own children but that was one part of it but the other part is there s a sense of they go to school they do what they do you come back and you re so happy to see them right you know you get to interact with them instead of you know really arguing i think that s what we did mostly and if there s any parents listening you know exactly what i m talking about you spent most of your time fighting with them about doing their work and keeping up with this and keeping up with that when they go to school you you you do your thing they do their thing and you come back as a family later and you re like hey i love you good to see you instead of by the end of the day we want to kill each other because we ve been arguing all day yeah and yeah no there s like a different level of respect that they have for teachers or coaches versus you know when parents try to tell them to do i notice that too yeah absolutely that s interesting so you know since you ve been you know spending time in the district you know talking with your constituents kind of working events kind of what what are a lot of your constituents kind of talking about with you and kind of i guess concerned about coming up you know in this coming months and years well you know um i i don t think it s unusual to everybody you know the number one issue right now is the homelessness issue and um for for our communities especially in my area you know we see a lot of folks that are struggling um financially i have a lot of low income community members and we re trying to do the best that we can for them i i think for any community in california at the end of the day folks want a roof over their heads food on their table and a great education for their children and i think we re all on board with that but how we get there for everybody is very different so the conversation always goes back to homelessness i uh spent the last couple months even while in session you know talking to a lot of my superintendents a lot of my city managers going to some city council meetings because i think part of the problem is we we had the rent moratorium and through the state budget which i m part of we had an amazing opportunity to make folks hole not just the renters but the landlords to be able to get money so that they were not losing this opportunity to make everybody whole so that we can all continue when we get out completely out of the pandemic everybody still has a place to live unfortunately that money is not getting to the hands of the people that need it and we re trying to figure out why so like i said i spent a lot of time talking to the superintendent s schools um my city managers the mayors and council members because when i talked to them i said oh look there s this program you know we have all this money for for folks to be able to access rental assistants and a lot of them didn t know it existed which was really a surprise to me so we spent myself and my staff spent a lot of time going around the um kind of my different cities i represented 11 cities um making sure that they knew as a teacher i can tell you that a lot of the information that was um distributed was from outside sources so i talked to my superintendents i said hey if i send you a you know copy of this where folks can access this rental assistance can you help me distribute it and some of them did not all of them but some of them did distribute it but i think you know the constituency i think again at the end of the day they want a roof over their head food on their table and a good education for their kids and so part of the challenge for a lot of folks is making the rent or choosing between rent and food and so that s two out of three priorities right and then with the with the school being shut down the school s been shut down um the majority of the year um you know that was another um issue that we were dealing with is how are we going to make these kids catch up to basically a year lost um you know in education so those really by far those three things were always a priority for my for my constituents now on the other hand you know i have a lot of business community members i have 11 cities and in my district and kind of the senate district there s 20 000 small businesses folks misunderstand when i say i m from l a county a lot of the folks that are not familiar with my area assume that we are part of the you know the downtown l a all the big buildings all those big corporations and those big buildings and they don t understand that san gabriel valley is not downtown l a our communities depend on small businesses in order for them to survive so the personal part again um uh was a roof over their head food on their table and and a great education for their kids you flip that to the business community and the business communities you know hurting how are they going to keep their doors open you know et cetera right excuse me so i guess how i guess how are your cities doing coming out of covet 19 you know i guess the rental assistance is gonna i guess expire this month so i guess kind of heading into the end of the year and into next year are they recovering nicely or kind of do you see i guess problems no definitely a lot of problems um i think like i said my communities i depend on the small businesses so we re trying to make the small businesses you know whole again um either through legislation through assistance for them and i think the number one priority is to get everybody back to work after the the moratorium ends i hope not but i believe that there s going to be an influx of folks losing their their their homes their apartments and i think the way we we can head that off is by making sure that everybody s back at work and so there is that you know folks are uh trying to do the right thing right and make sure that that we re open for business but i think a lot of our community members and i m going to say it um you know believe that um they have this idea about the vaccine um you know for whatever reason that it they re not going to take it so i think the challenge is for us right now is make making sure everybody s vaccinated um so that we that um you know the local eateries are are comfortable opening because you know you don t infect everybody and but again we have different challenges i represent a community that s more moderate and so i hear a lot of the rhetoric and you know just to be honest with you it s not even the the more red cities in my area that that have that that belief about the covid and about the vaccine some of my local communities mainly and i and it s uh interesting to me mainly a lot of the older um uh latino women are like no you know they tell me that they you know the misinformation is as being passed along so one lady said she said that uh you know that she s not taking the vaccine because there s a tracker in it and so i you know instead of i was baffled right but but i i said you know with respect in spanish i said um if they re tracking you like what did you do that you re afraid of being tracked you know and she was like obviously no answer because they re listening to this rhetoric and i said and and if they tracked you what would you be doing i said because they can track me and i can tell you i go to work i pick up the kids from drop the kids off at school go to work pick them up go to you know to do my my jobs i said so if they tracked me they would track me you know back and up and forth from home to work and so i don t know you know what we re afraid of about being tracked because our cell phones track us 100 of the time so so she she didn t quite understand that they re it s interesting there s two mind frames right so she s talking about the being tracked and when i was trying to be logical about the fear of being tracked um she didn t really have an answer and then so of course i you know i stopped and then you know throughout my conversations with other community members you know some of that information comes comes up and i have to be really honest with you i said okay you guys complain about the state being dysfunctional and that we can t get anything right do you we can t you know we had so many issues with edd and and the dmv do you think we re really going to open a department that s going to house all of these people that are tracking us for what i said you already say we re incompetent there s no way in hell that we re going to be able to attract as many people so you know at this point people have already made up their mind and i can you know try to use logic as much as possible but it s still you know on one part of the brain is not connecting with the other they believe the rhetoric but when we try to talk about you know practical things like why would they track us why would folks track us and what would they get out of it and you know for what reason there s no answer so so they get offended and then they just stop the conversation and so it s really that conversation as well so when we go back to talking about how we reopen and how our businesses are doing some of them are opening and some of them are you know not they re afraid and so until we can get into a pattern of you know really um getting back uh folks back to work then we can make those businesses whole once the revenue starts coming in then you know our cities are going to start doing better because i told you we i have a majority of small businesses in my area well with 11 cities guess what they depend on they depend on that that revenue from those small businesses so the longer they stay shut down the longer that they re not going to be made whole i mean we can sit and talk about this for hours and hours and hours but i do have to say and i know it s not you know people are gonna talk about uh personal freedoms but i was in san francisco by the way on my spare time because you know i have nothing else to do i completed the san francisco half marathon uh a couple weeks ago so i was so thank you thank you um you know i have to do something for my sanity which i thought was really insane that i m using a 13 1 mile uh walk to be you know keep my sanity but that s a whole other conversation but when i was in san francisco i was not able to go to any of the eateries or any uh any places in san francisco without showing my vaccine card which i thought wow this is cool because we re not infringing upon anybody s rights if you know if that s what they re saying but you can t just go out to eat then if you don t have your vaccine so those are choices that folks need to make and at some point they need to make them but i really appreciated san francisco because they did not let me into an eatery unless i showed them my vaccine card and you know if you want to go eat out to eat you want to go to war you want to go somewhere if they if uh you want your life to to return then you show your vaccine card if you don t then you stay home not you know not vaccinated i don t know what answer we can give to folks but it s really hurting our businesses by you know having the stance for and against um the vaccine i think you know if we all do um the right thing for ourselves like if i don t want to do the vaccine and i know that s not what we were going to talk about but if i don t want to take that vaccine that s fine but i have two children i have a a a 14 year old and a 13 year old if anything happened to me i would not be able to to forgive myself because you know we were hearing about tragedies all over where children are being left orphaned because both parents are past again if you don t care about yourself don t get the vaccine but the consequences are if something happens to you you re leaving your children orphaned and i would not do that to my children and so i chose to vaccinate um you know to do that again i know this is not what we re talking about but i think it s important to have that conversation because it affects our businesses i can t open my businesses um fully because we have these breakout cases we have these you know little pockets of of of uh the kobit popping up because we re not doing what we re asked to do because for whatever reason anyway no that s well said and kind of talking with some people in the business community they re part of this kind of anti vaccine or they re worried about these mandates and i kind of you know go back to them as you put is is what s best for your business is for it to be open and for it to be open and and you know you know people have to get these vaccines and we have to you know empty these hospitals out so you know definitely definitely well put right well and then you know if i can add a little bit i ve got family members in kansas yes i have family in kansas and um uh i you know we re in conversations i lost an uncle to covered um in texas in last october um and just last week three of my family members um actually five three my aunt my niece and uh a cousin are hospitalized um because they were not vaccinating and then um some of the kids the kids around um the family members were sick now they were not hospitalized but they were home not not in school their home and uh one of my cousins is a nurse and she s kind of trying to hold the whole family that found part of the family in kansas together and she s devastated she says how can i you know make our family members understand that this is terrible and so as you can imagine in kansas the conversation is very different and some of them are democrats most the majority of my family members are democrats so it s not even you know a republican versus democrat it s about the information that s being spread through the news media through the news outlets i don t know how they depend on on facebook and all of the social media outlets to get their information but you know i talked to my brother and i said you know where are you getting your information from and he says oh well the news is saying it the neighbors and i said have you talked to a doctor and it was like no and i said well when you talk to a doctor call me back and then we can have this conversation because you know the news media is is is biased one way or the other i you know can t get into that but unless we do the research and talk to actual doctors and the doctors tell you don t do it then we can have that conversation but i guarantee you that if everybody listening goes that is anti the vaccine goes talk to an actual medical doctor they ll tell you the truth i i you know i engage on social media because i have to but i don t get my news from social media i don t get you know i talked to my doctor when i went to get vaccinated i was like what do you think they re like absolutely get vaccinated you know and again if you re not doing it for yourself do it for your children because if something happens to you you re going to leave um kids that are orphaned sorry i had to add that because you know if anybody s listening and thinks that i m not going through anything trust me my family members are going through it right now and and of course now that they re in the hospital they re like oh my god i should have gotten vaccinated well by then it s it s too late so don t don t let it be too late take care of your children by taking care of yourself definitely definitely uh so so this year we you know yet another interesting legislative session uh you know you were limited to what 12 bills yes so i guess how did you fare this year and how many you got sitting on the governor s desk waiting to be signed or already yeah so we re playing the odds um you know i ve gotten um i think i i have uh three signs so far i ve got another three uh sitting on the governor s desk and so so i i knew it was gonna happen you know if you have 12 if you do 50 you re good and so i ve gotten six of them on to the governor we re still waiting on a couple of them um to be signed but they were pretty pretty uh straightforward in my opinion i wanted to focus on you know cleaning up some legislation i do a lot of work on foster kids i do a lot of kids with a lot of work with um adults um seniors uh and so so i focused a lot of my legislation on you know kind of doing that kind of work especially right now because of kovitz some of our the most vulnerable communities are suffering and those are like our foster kids there are the the adults the seniors um adults with disabilities seniors so i did a lot of that um uh legislation and we re faring pretty well now i m really excited i think the you know a lot of our our um our effort went into trying to get um some wins uh in terms of the budget for our district so legislative wise i think i m preparing pretty well i m still you know crossing my fingers i m i it s kind of a cool process if you haven t been through it and once the the governor has the legislation on his desk the member gets a call prior to you know either the signature or the veto and so when you see the the the phone call from the governor s office um we re all like okay what is it gonna be you know which one is it and so i get the call and they tell us uh so far it s been three three good ones you know the the legislation has been signed and then i start texting my staff and we all start celebrating and but as soon as the governor s office number comes up we re like okay what do you think you know we start trying to figure out they call your seller they call the office myself they call the cell phone it s kind of cool so they call a cell phone and you know and they they usually if i don t pick up they ll leave a message but if i pick up they call and this is so and so from the governor s office wanted to let you know that um you know you whatever are you know ab um 650 for example is being signed um you know congratulations so it s really cool um the first year when i was here i was like who s this i didn t really answer the phone and then i was like oh this is what happens so now it s kind of a a cool uh thing you know when i m uh doing stuff and i see a call uh most of the time i will say it s like the governor s office but but when it s a 916 number i m like okay i have to answer it because it might be the governor s office so it s a kind of a little game it s kind of exciting but it s fun what are the last three bills you re waiting for uh for signature let s see i have to look because there were so many of them um let s see see i i have the ones that i have been signed i you are now you re making me look for the ones that have not been signed we don t memorize all of them what s happened sign okay all right let me tell you which ones have been signed all right so we ve got ab1243 was signed um 1243 is preventing isolation and financial abuse of vulnerable california so that s my senior bills so what was happening is if a a uh elderly person was in a in a home for example right um some there s always a primary caregiver and what was happening sometimes the families will get into a fight and the primary caregiver would not give access to those those folks that that they were fighting with and so so they had to file a restraining order it s the weirdest thing because you think the opposite but the family members that wanted to see their loved one have to file a restraining order in order to get access to their family members and they have to prove you know that their good intentions well what was happening and in a lot of cases obviously not all but the cases that i heard is the the family member that was in control was also taking advantage of that senior and you know uh getting credit on behalf of the senior getting money out on behalf of the senior so it s really elder abuse but but it was a difficult um conversation because the family members that want to help that member the the senior have to file a restraining order so anyway so so 1243 um helped streamline that for the family members that were were trying to see the fact the the elderly person and so they they now have access and the other party has to prove why not not the other way around it s a complicated one but it helps those those um elderly folks in homes that are being taken advantage of and helping the family members that want to see their loved one and so this one helped the other one that was signed was uh 1281 criminal protective orders um and so this is another kind of in my lane i do a lot of work with domestic violence victims and i m the the chair of the select committee on domestic violence so what was happening is um some of these these uh people that i i want to call in criminals look i m sorry but if you re abusing your spouse you re a criminal but a lot of these folks would go um and they have say a misdemeanor but they had a a uh protective order in place so they would get the the the misdemeanor expunged at some point right there s a way to do it and what was happening is once they expunged the the the crime or whatever the penalty was sometimes the the protective order would go with it and so my bill said okay you can expunge all you want but if there s a protective order you can t touch that you know the protective order remained intact because a lot of these were victims of domestic violence that had protective orders in place and um anyway so the protective orders were dropped and so my bill said you can expunge all you want but the protective orders um have to be maintained you have to talk to the victim to make sure that you re not we re not uh inadvertently dropping the protective orders along with the expungement of whatever the crime is right so so it it s separated both right you can still expunge but you have to maintain the protective order or at minimum talk to the victim to make sure that they are okay with you know with either dropping the protective order or continuing it so now it gives the victim the right to not um drop the protective order so they re again they re not sexy they re not hashtaggable uh uh bills but for me really important because you know we we have so many instances especially now and i i m sure you ve heard the statistics that during covet all of the domestic violence um cases increase uh uh domestic abuse not just for adults but for children sexual abuse uh have increased because now we re at home all the time and so these types of bills were really important to me because i want to make sure that we protect um folks now and as soon as we start getting out of the pandemic or kind of a more of a normal life you know that we re going to have a lot more cases so again they re not sexy hashtaggable um types of bills but for me really important because we re trying to protect as many people as possible exactly and and your last one was that 477 or 77 yes yes so 477 is the children advocacy center um so i do a lot of work with children advocacy centers i there s one that s near and dear to my heart excuse me near and dear to my heart in covina and you know unfortunately we have kids that are being abused so children advocacy centers what what their role is is they take the kids in they interview the children um they bring law enforcement they bring um uh the da s office in and counselors to so that they are present behind the wall behind the kind of the double sided mirrors so when the kids are telling their stories the the advent the advocate can you know record but there s uh what we call multi disciplinary teams intact so that they can listen in and the kids that have been abused don t when they go to court the kids don t have to testify now these teams can testify on their behalf so that the kids are not really traumatized and so for me again trying to protect kids trying to protect domestic violence um uh victims and also trying to protect the elderly so these the the children s advocacy center do amazing work and you know before i started in the legislature i didn t really know what that they existed and when i went to visit them i it was like wow it s trauma for the child but i cannot imagine even after being a teacher i cannot imagine having to listen to these stories from from children on on you know their abuse and so the children advocacy centers came to me and said we need this and i said absolutely i will do whatever i can to make sure that the advocacy centers are there taking care of our kids and that you know obviously the the teams again i said the police department the da s office uh we ve got uh social workers that are involved in this whole process and so the multi disciplinary teams are able to now collaborate and make sure that the kids are not re traumatized when when they go after the abusers yeah well bad so you know i guess you know the first year of a two year session obviously you i guess you had six bills that didn t make it uh you re kind of listening to the district listen to your staff kind of working in your package for next year kind of what what are some of the things you re already looking at for next year to kind of take a look at so so one of the bills that um that went to sleep that died um is still near and dear to my heart um so i want to work on uh what we did was i don t know if you knew but uh once upon a time before i came to the legislature um preschools were able to to expel three and four year olds okay so let me say that again preschools were expelling three and four year olds which as a teacher i can tell you three and four year olds are going to enjoy staying home music so we re basically reinforcing the the whatever behavior the they were being expelled for so when i came in i i saw that that three and four year olds were being expelled so i said uh no we i i couldn t believe that we had to write a bill but we had to write a bill that says that um if you re receiving any state money you may not expel three and four year olds because they re three and four um you know those of you that have children you know that that our kids go through different developmental stages and one of the stages that the kids go through is biting because they can t communicate they get frustrated because they can t communicate so a lot of these cases where the kids were being expelled for fighting well if you look at the you know developmental chart biting is part of the development for these children so anyway so i wrote a bill uh that was signed that said if you re receiving any money from um from state agencies are actually state preschools you may not uh expel uh preschool kids so then the following year i did a follow up bill that um i know some of my my uh you know the listeners are uh are thinking well how do you deal with problem children let me tell you how so the following year we did a bill to provide mental health uh consultation consultants to be able to help the student be able to help the parent and to support the teacher because i can tell you as a teacher i know how to teach the you know uh reading writing and arithmetic but i m not capable of trying to deal with some of the trauma that kids come in with and so so we did the bill and it was a success so now we have mental health consultations our consultants that go into the the preschool classroom they help the student with their issues they go to the home and help the parents and now the teachers are being provided um support so that they can also teach so the bill that that died was if now these are our state preschools the bill that died or is asleep right now we re going to bring it up next year it s sleeping it s taking a long nap i ll wake it up next year this is for um the the local preschools you know the the lady down the street that has her her the lady or gentleman down the street that they have their own little preschool program where they do daycare and preschool if now this bill was said if you are receiving any money from the state you have to comply basically with the non expansion expulsion of these kids look it sounds like it would be in my mind um i don t know a no brainer to make sure that kids are not expelled because you and i know that uh expelling kids doesn t do for them do doesn t do anything for them first and foremost they re not learning but number two we re reinforcing whatever behavior they were expelled for because now they re at home and they re thinking hey if i bite somebody i m gonna get to go home so so we re reinforcing those those uh those uh things that they were being excelled for so now the bill says that if you re receiving any kind of state money for preschool uh programs then um you may not expel the kids and again the hope is that we don t expel them and we want to get them some support so that the kids are not we can deal with the trauma that that is creating that behavior we can help the parents then we can help the preschool teachers be able to at least provide support for for the kids are coming in with some of these traumas so that s the bill that i m working on and then of course we have you know advocates for different issues that come to us and you know we get to pick really cool things or not um uh you know for me i try to do at least one that one two or three that are really dear to my heart and then you know we we talk to different stakeholders about um you know what they would like to see and so we engage in that matter but for right now my baby is going to be my key bill is going to be that preschool explosion program um though save the biters save the biters i like it hey you know what that is a good one save the biters because look and it s it s funny but it s but the thing is i i taught kindergarten first grade and fifth or fourth grade through my teaching career well guess what if the kids are not prepared in preschool i get to see them in in in kindergarten in first grade and if we don t save the biters now they re gonna be biters in kinder first second and and so on and so if we save them now then by the time i get you know kindergarten teachers get them and first grade teachers get them hopefully we have provided enough support that they re not biting anymore i like it save the biters exactly exactly you know you just kind of mentioned kind of like a lot of special interest lobbyists are are working on kind of their budget requests and their things for their clients right now kind of what what advice you have for i guess people looking to shop their ideas coming you know this this fall and winter uh you know how to present them and you know how i guess how how to get you know the best chance of you know getting a vehicle parked with someone early early um you know i think it s um i didn t understand the time you know the first year i was kind of oblivious to these timelines i was kind of just thrown in and you know you learn trial by fire right and now this is my fifth year and my best advice is early come in early um i uh assembly member cooper love him to death but he always puts a sign um the last two days of of of the bill deadline the introduction deadline and he says if you didn t see me before now don t come to me now because sometimes you know if you wait till the end you know we re either booked we ve you know we ve already uh exhausted our build limit or by then you know we re your last choice and it kind of doesn t feel good to be the last choice so so what i recommend is go in early number one but number two really think about i know we say that in in the craziness of a legislative year but really look at what members have focused on in the past and find and align your issues with those members i do a lot of work i like i said with foster kids i do a lot of work it s not sexy and hashtaggable so if you have a sexy bill call me first but the sexy and hashtag able bills um you know are are the ones that people tend to take on first and it s cool if you have one of those but i try to take on the bills that really make a difference in in kind of the areas that i ve been uh uh playing in and so find a legislator that aligns with that issue area and present them present it to them first now i know we all dabble in a whole bunch of of things because you know that s the nature of the game but really get to know the legislator and their legislation their key legislation and make sure you go to them first and talk about it now not in january january by then we re already you know getting ready for the crazy season but right now yes we re busy but it s a good opportunity to start talking to some of the legislators and say hey hey blanca rubio i know you work with uh you know a lot of the domestic violence issues can i talk to you about this bill or children advocacy center or you know i ve uh i did a cool budget request and i know you ll probably talk about that because we have to talk about it because it was a really a for me it was a big win but um we talked about food being medicine so one of my bills was about making food part of kind of the medi cal uh uh program fortunately for me the governor put it in the budget anyway so i i dropped the bill because you know it s in the budget anyway oh sorry but the being at home means the doggy is uh here what s his name but uh anyway and so look at the what the legislators uh her name is jackson hi girlfriend and i was not i was not a dog person ever ever but i have to give props to assemblywoman christina garcia she talked me into adopting a dog from spca because my daughter nadia wasn t gonna have a dog so we got jack c we adopted jacksie may 6 of 20 um 19 so jaxy is

before was like a train wreck is the best way i can describe it i was not the person that god meant me to be and i had nothing i pretty much had every single job you could think of and in every job that i ve had i ve been discriminated against it s hard to believe that my life was saved by solar train horn piano music not too long after my parents divorced my mom became a single mother which caused tension between the two of us i ran away a lot so that eventually led me to a group home and i eventually ran away from there too and that led me to the department of corrections which is where i got my first adult record i was about to be a felon i had charges pending that were really gonna limit my employment opportunities and i didn t know how to change it and didn t feel like i had the support that i needed to really get through that stage in my life so i signed up for jobs partnership at that local church jobs partnership helps people by training them to get jobs to get second third fourth fifth chances in life because rarely do people move up in a straight line in illinois entry level wages are about 10 an hour or about 20 000 a year that s poverty wages and so if we re going to move people out of poverty we have to find them jobs that pay better than that my life was uh a life of addiction criminal activity and failure i was a heroin addict and it came about as a young age i was arrested for possession and manufacture of heroin it destroyed not only myself but my family i would say that was just about the lowest point in my life and i realized that if i didn t change at that time that i was either going to the penitentiary for a long time or i would eventually die as an addict and that s not what i wanted to do my prayers were eventually answered when a program called jobs partnership came into the jail during a recruiting tour they all come out with no hope other than knowing that jobs partnership was there with them when they were in prison so now that they re out of prison and taking us up on the promise that we made that we were gonna be there to help them with these green energy jobs particularly solar jobs we re helping people get around 40 000 a year or better so that s the goal move people up out of the bottom into the middle class change the trajectory of their lives so they can buy houses get cars send their kids to college or trade school or whatever but it changes their vision of what they can accomplish with their lives the folks that typically get jobs in solar right now are cisgender white male under 35 men who have been in construction since they were young adults i work with a lot of black and brown folks in the community and our focus is on formerly incarcerated women specifically a solar training hub is like a direct line for a participant that goes through it to be hired on with a company in a clean energy job the skills that the solar hubs provide is everything from all the way up to that hands on training from what you ll be doing day to day at an actual job this opens the door to actually finding employment and being hired that last step once you have all these skills you re in an interview and they say what are your skills what do you do best you ll use this chart and say ok out of all of these these 5 are the ones i feel i m most good at and i use most frequently the folks that i work with are definitely discriminated against because of their background as soon as they start to do that background search or criminal history search no matter how many diplomas you have or how much experience you have you re immediately written off my community is dark we don t get a lot of information to success no type of career is offered for people like me when i first started with jobs partnership i really had my doubts i was like i don t know if this is really gonna work i actually started at a 3rd grade reading and math level but i still put my all into it every single day and it definitely paid off when i finished i had the highest grades out of the entire class installing solar makes me feel like a hero because i m actually doing something that helps the environment it doesn t even seem like a job it feels like you put on your cape you go out there you save the world these hubs should be everywhere because there are a lot of broken communities there are a lot of black communities and people who need jobs and this could help repair a lot of people s lives the future energy jobs act known as feja was really the start of the process it created a handful of job hubs but all that money s run out and so we need a new bill that s gonna move us to a clean energy economy by 2030 and get us off fossil fuels and that s called the clean energy jobs act ceja the fight to actually becoming a hub has been pretty rough just being completely honest the biggest barrier that we ve had is the fact that the clean energy job act focuses on black and brown communities and there are folks that feel like that s not a priority adding that extra piece that provides jobs to minorities isn t something that people are interested in we have essentially a 6 week window to get the clean energy jobs act through the illinois house it s going to come down to grassroots power grassroots and faith power to engage those legislative decision makers we re facing really a challenge by corporations that have more power than probably any single segment of society in the existence of humanity the big utility corporations they want to control and own the power generation and we re saying that that s just not gonna happen meeting folks in illinois people s action sent me on a road of community organizing finding that value and love in doing something chanting c e j a c ej a chanting c e j a c ej a i ve done canvassing with local organizations also met with representative dan brady so what we re asking you to do is not just to sign this new bill and agree with it but we re actually asking if you can co sponsor the clean energy jobs act are you willing to cosponsor the clean energy jobs act music this is 2021 we have to stand up so whether you re a legislator or whether you re a community member we have to be called to action because enough is enough i want to be able to say to people on the southeast side that you can breathe the air you can drink the water you can play in the park everyone deserves that no matter where you live ceja is a core part of redefining what it means to thrive in 21st century illinois my son he looks at me as being a real dad now a responsible man a respected man and i m also a grandfather and they haven t seen any of the addiction all they have seen is papa is going to meetings papa is going to work papa is always in church my kids are very proud of their father my kids are very proud of their father if the clean energy jobs act bill passes it would be a very overwhelming moment for me i m excited to get that started like i m almost jumping outta my seat i can t wait i d probably laugh at you because i was scared of heights laughs so when i first got on the roof i was nervous the ladder was really my challenge because you have to swing your foot over the ladder to get down so you have to hang off the edge of the roof for a tiny second and that was kinda scary but when i stepped on the roof that s when i knew that this is something i want to do for the rest of my life,"legislator,heroin,economy,fossil,incarcerated,college,prison,addiction,middle class,wages,criminal,jobs,school,black,black

debate on conventional media for the rest of us i m ravi gupta and i m corey bradford and welcome to our very first episode and before we get down to the news of the week i want to just take a step back and explain why we even exist not just the show but our entire company the lost debate and to start i just want to tell you a little bit about myself i grew up in staten island new york to a family that s split politically in a neighborhood that s split politically and i ve got people in my life that i m either not talking to them or they re not talking to me because of my politics and it makes me exhausted and i ve lived this divide that we have right now and one thing that worries me deeply is that our media is driving us apart our media lacks nuance objectivity any tolerance i think that we need a different kind of project a project that not only brings us together but challenges us to listen to each other and i couldn t be more excited than to start this journey with corey bradford straight from oxford alabama welcome corey well thank you ravi i appreciate that and you know when i discovered lost debate online it was really interesting because you guys were already doing something that that i had been doing because i have a background in politics as well but for the last couple of years i ve been entertaining generation z on tick tock that s what i do i m still my famous tick tocker you know i do these satirical videos about politics and history and i usually take stabs at like you know both sides i critique the right and the left call them out on their bs but also you know point out when they may be on to something and that s exactly what lost debate is doing so it s really you know a unique opportunity to do this at a more serious sort of kind of journalistic level and i couldn t be more excited to start this revolution in media with you well corey and i are both what we like to call political eclectics so although we ve worked in politics our views don t fit neatly in one side or the other and this is a home for people like that so whether you re an independent you re the dreaded moderate or you re even somebody who has strong political allegiances but you re sick of living in an echo chamber this is the place for you and as background i ve worked in politics so i was one of the first staffers for barack obama s campaign and i went on to start an organization that trained over 100 successful candidates and over a thousand staffers but i also was a principal and superintendent of a network of charter schools and in that role i worked alongside republicans to protect those schools and one thing i came away with is that our country we have to live alongside people with different political beliefs than we have and that means we have to learn how to talk to each other about our different beliefs and our values speaking of that corey what are we going to talk about today well we ve got a lot going on today ravi we re going to take a look at how the twitterverse is politicizing this horrible alec baldwin accident wuhan china revelations was the right actually right on this one and why are trump supporters chanting let s go brandon we ve got a fantastic interview with democratic congressman richie torres from the bronx we talked to him about a number of things including his support of charter schools and some of the ways that he differs from other progressives in the democratic party a yale law student is facing cancellation because of his trap house and finally we break down the topic that could literally decide the virginia governor s race critical race theory and just what the hell it even is it s a packed show but first we re going to get into our segment called lost and found where we take the stories that the mainstream media lost but we found and ravi our set of stories today is not necessarily stuff the mainstream media lost but they just sound lost when they talk about it for instance these vaccine mandates regarding police officers we know that s going to be something that s going to be affecting police departments all across the board over the next couple of weeks and governor desantis in florida is trying to take advantage of it in a really unique way let s take a look at that clip and florida governor ron desantis now said he wants to give unvaccinated cops a five thousand dollar bonus to move to his state nypd minneapolis seattle if you re not being treated well we ll treat you better here you can feel important needs for us and we ll compensate you as a result so cory governor desantis is essentially creating a hamster dam if you ve ever seen the wire for law enforcement in florida in kind of a safe zone um for the for the a coveted safe zone and is it really safe though it sounds like the opposite well that s what we need to discuss right and i think that there s this huge debate going on in this country or awareness of labor shortages across the country i think that the most significant labor shortage we may be facing is not at the docks which is important and maybe not with truck drivers but with police officers yes absolutely and what s driving this is a couple of things one is we ve had a a historic uh crisis of um understaffing of police departments um coming out of covid and june of 2020 and then on top of that you have these vaccine mandates which are hitting police departments uh that were already understaffed and most notably you have seattle where they have something on the order of almost 10 percent of their police force that are out of work right now in an already understaffed police department and then where we live in new york in a couple of days the mandate hits uh officers where they have they have to have gotten their first shot and last time i checked there were only 71 percent of officers who had gotten a shot which means there could be a huge shortage here in new york city as well a huge crisis cory yeah it s a huge crisis and it s a crisis that governor desantis is definitely taking political advantage of and i just think that there s no bottom to how low this governor will go to appeal to the far right i mean he s literally trying to poach cops from other states unvaccinated cops mind you and get them all to collect in one area i mean that s like a super spreader event waiting to happen it doesn t really make any sense when you really think about police officers they put themselves on the front lines they re some of the people that are most vulnerable to covet 19 and we ve already seen a lot of police officers over the course of the last year die from covet 19 in fact four times as many cops have died from covet 19 this year than from gun violence so this is already a very vulnerable group and desantis has really taken advantage of that and it seems like he s willing to put the health and safety of both those cops and just the citizens of florida in general at risk just to be the top conservative in the country yeah this seems like a big signaling moment uh and the politics of this are extremely dicey uh and it s not just on the right uh let s look at uh john oliver commenting on this just a few days ago constant refrain we hear from cops every time they kill an unarmed black person is they should have complied with commands because as long as you comply things will supposedly go well but that only seems to work one way because when officers are asked to follow simple rules or face consequences a not insignificant amount of them flip their __ so you know what if an officer wants to quit over this __ let them let the individuals who clearly don t care about public safety stop being in charge of public safety corey i hear what john oliver s saying there is a major contradiction here worth pointing out and i think it is really important for officers for example like in chicago to hand over their vaccination records when it s mandated they need to comply with the law to state the obvious but at the same time i think he s being a little flip about what it means to have these officers not show up for duty i m pretty sure john oliver is not uh carrying the weight of under policing on his shoulders yeah i mean this has been a significant problem with the left right you ve got extreme factions on the left that have been screaming defund the police and the reality is a lot of them that are saying that are these political elites who live in really good neighborhoods and they re not going to have to deal with the fallout of defunding the police and what that actually means it s the communities of color and these poor communities that are actually going to have to deal with these high crime rates as a result of defunding the police and there s a lot of polling data to suggest that most black and brown people i think like 81 of them don t support defunding the police they simply want police reform so this has been one of those talking points on the left that s very flawed if you ask me right and uh more data backs up your claims because axis came out with a poll over the weekend that reflects the fact that crime is going up in this country but the two different sides of america the political divide have very different views about what s driving those increases in crime so republicans believe that the increases in crime are because of the defund movement by a majority democrats don t believe that democrats believe that it s loose gun laws that are driving violent crime and a very small percentage of republicans believe that so you have two different stories cory about why we have rising crime in america well of course you know the right and the far right are going to take that defund the police and make that the focal point of their argument you know seattle s a good example of a city that did defund the police and now you re seeing the cop crisis there you re seeing higher crime rates there but also you got cities like nashville and houston that increased funding for police and they still saw significant increases in their crime rates so there is not necessarily a definite correlation between defunding the police and higher crime rates but to the left s point i mean gun sales did increase exponentially during the pandemic so it is very possible that that s contributed to the rising crime but really crime rates rise and fall in different cities for different reasons and i don t think either side really understands the nuances of what causes those increases and decreases to crime and so right now we re just playing this sort of kind of political back and forth instead of really taking a more focused look at what s really causing the crime rise that we ve seen in the last year or so in this country but getting back to the vaccine mandates i mean do you feel that that s something that s appropriate for police officers across the board is that something that more cities should go into even though we re seeing shortages in cops these days yeah i do i am a supporter of vaccine mandates i think that i would carve out certain places like seattle where if you re already facing a massive crisis in staffing for your police department i would be careful about these mandates but i think in the vast majorities of cities including new york we could we could bear the the cost of some police officers not showing up and i say this to somebody whose mom is a city health worker and i m i was really glad to see that vaccine mandate because she s of a series of risk factors i wouldn t say more my mom will get mad at me that makes me worry about her in covenant so i m glad that her the people around her are vaccinated absolutely and i mean i totally agree with vaccine mandates as well i do believe that when it comes to police officers and police departments it should be an individualized thing every office should operate based off of what they feel is best for them i think if you get to like you know 89 vaccinated and there s people who have legitimate religious exemptions or legitimate medical exemptions i don t see the need to push that last little bit especially if weekly testing or bi weekly testing is a part of the equation i think that that definitely needs to be balanced but it s just a story we re going to have to continue to watch i think the next story we re going to talk about is alec baldwin terrible tragedy that happened involving him everybody s talking about it but some people are really talking about it in the absolute wrong way the worst way possible yeah and uh as background uh there was this movie called rust being filmed and alec baldwin accidentally shot and killed a woman named helena hutchins who was a director of photography on the set the gun was supposed to be cold meaning it wasn t supposed to have a bullet in it but it was hot which means it did have a bullet in it and somebody else got shot as well director i believe um and it s a tragedy uh the reason why we re talking about it is not because you know gun violence on the set of hollywood is particularly interesting for us but uh the reaction to it was notable because it revealed the worst about us as a society you had total politicization where members of the right were gleeful including donald trump jr who was trying to sell a t shirt about guns don t kill people alec baldwin kills people jd vance was calling on twitter to reinstate donald trump s twitter account so that he can comment on baldwin and then you had some people who i don t know what their politics are but who were sharing old audio of baldwin fighting with his daughter suggesting that he s a hothead who probably deserved this there was uh there were also people who were talking about union organizing on the set and within an hour were claiming certain things about who was responsible and who wasn t and i just think that this was a really sad moment where we all just need to step back and instead of positing our theories about it just kind of let people deal with the tragedy yeah to me it was just absolutely disgusting the way so many people on the right handled this just because they disagree with alec baldwin s politics or because he played trump on snl to take the tragedy the the tragic death of this woman one of and and also one thing people got to understand is how few females there are that work as cinematographers in hollywood so to lose one in this way is tragic enough and then to take that and try to politicize it when this has absolutely nothing to do with politics it s just really disturbing and disgusting for so many reasons not to mention i mean they re really attacking alec baldwin because he s been an outspoken liberal he s been an outspoken critic of trump but isn t that free speech i mean these are the same people that try to defend free speech no matter what it is but the minute they hear free speech that they don t agree with they try to go against it and again it s just a really terrible tragedy that s just been politicized in all the worst ways by the right right and you know if you were to politicize it uh i think the fact that this shooting even happened shows that you know guns might be dangerous yeah should probably be careful about who gets them right it actually proves the left s point a little bit i mean their whole thing is they re going against alec baldwin because he s been a proponent of gun uh of gun control but at the same time the fact that he with a gun discharged it in an unsafe manner it actually proves that guns are dangerous in the hands of the wrong people which is the whole point that the left has been saying about gun control i mean i m a gun owner i m not necessarily for strict gun control but at the same time this is this is not like they re not proving the political point i think the right thinks they re proving right now right i think there are two things that happens when these times of tragedies happen on social media the first thing is uh that each side tries to fit the facts into their preconceived narrative and i think this happened in the boulder shooting yes uh with much different effect which uh the you know members of the left in that example uh rushed to call the shooter white when the shooter it turns out wasn t one because they just desperately wanted the facts to fit whatever argument they wanted to make instead of and just imagine being a victim or a victim s family and having to deal with all these people commenting who don t know what the after talking about this issue while you re dealing with such a big tragedy and then there s another phenomenon that happens when these shootings happen which is uh everybody becomes an expert you know i remember or any tragedy right when covert first happened everybody was an epidemiologist when they uh the election results were being contested in the days after the november election everybody was an election expert then just couple months ago everybody s an expert on afghanistan and refugees and now everybody s an expert on workplace safety in hollywood yeah we went from foreign policy experts in september to hollywood safety experts in october it doesn t make any sense and it just really points to just the toxic nature of social media just how toxic it s gotten and how we re just willing to take any little issue that has nothing to do with politics and then politicize it for our particular side well speaking of experts who don t know what they re talking about i m gonna try to make sense of this new revelation i think first reported in vanity fair that the national institute of health which is the organization that employs dr fauci recently admitted that they re funding risky virus research in wuhan province and why is this important because dr fauci went in front of congress earlier this year and gotten back and forth with rand paul in which rand paul was trying to press fauci to admit that there were funding research like this and fauci said that they didn t do you still support funding of the nih funding of the lab in wuhan senator paul with all due respect you are entitled entirely and completely incorrect that the nih has not ever and does not now fund gain of function research in the wuhan institute do they find doctors and so i want to pause here to say that there s a very complicated debate happening about whether fauci lied and what he knew and when he knew it and it all revolves around this terminology called gain of function meaning like there s a term to describe the exact kind of research that makes a virus more potent and this may or may not have technically been felt uh fell within that definition but i think the bigger point here is uh fauci when he was in front of congress knew what rand paul was getting at are we funding research to make viruses spread more fast and spread more fast to humans and fauci if he knew that this research was happening should have admitted it in that hearing because he knew what rand paul was getting at or if fausti didn t know that this research was happening why the hell does dr fauci not know that we re funding very dangerous research around the world so either we re incompetent or dishonest either way it doesn t look good no it doesn t look good at all this is a really complicated story uh it involved the nih and this other organization called eco health alliance and basically the research that they were doing and apparently there wasn t a there was a lack of communication with funding from the nih yes funding from the nih the nih didn t know precisely all the things that eco health was doing and apparently some of that research dealt with making viruses stronger and that s what this term gain of function deals with and really this points to in the larger context of everything we ve been hearing that that sort of kind of conspiracy theory that that covet 19 was man made that it was a result of a lab leak or possibly even something more sinister and that s something that we ve been hearing from the right especially the far right for more than a year now and originally that was like a theory that you couldn t touch everybody you said that oh no that s bonkers conspiracy theory and now it seems like there may be some evidence that there s no maybe not necessarily what the right is saying but there may be some truth to the lab leak theory yeah which is really concerning because facebook used to ban uh people even making that claim which should make us very concerned about restrictions on free speech in uh social media platforms and they had to they d walk that back the people who were talking about this a lot tend to be people who both believe not that the the wuhan theory is plausible but that it is a certainty which i think the evidence certainly doesn t support that yet i think it s just plausible and there s certainly a lot of murky stuff happening around sharing of data about what happened and all that that should concern us all but in contrast to a lot of those people i want dr fauci to be a credible figure i want our public health institutions to be credible and i think this is so frustrating because it just makes it really hard to build any trust that our public health institutions are doing the right thing well it s hard to have an honest conversation about it because so many on the left because fauci has become such a major figure with them they don t want to admit to the possibility of him lying or not knowing what he was talking about not to mention you compound that with the fact that there are people on the left that don t want to criticize anything to do with china right because if there s any criticism of china that starts to get linked to this anti asian sentiment which it s possible to criticize the government of china or possibly this wuhan laboratory without criticizing chinese people in general and i think that that s something the left has to understand is that you know we can have this conversation about this lab leak theory and what possibly happened without you know being racist towards asian people right and and it s also possible that there will be racists making some of the same arguments that you re making and that complicates things so you don t want to be like hey i m in with the racists yeah but you also don t want to let perhaps the most ill liberal country in the world uh a a country that s been stonewalling us in an investigation into the worst pandemic we ve seen in our lifetime we don t want to let them off the hook either so it s kind of a bind yeah it s a really complicated situation we re just gonna have to keep an eye on it coming up we have got a story that is going to astound you why are conservatives screaming let s go brandon at grocery stores and sporting events all across america we re gonna find out coming up next welcome to another edition of what does it mean where i decode the political memes that are making the rounds on facebook instagram or wherever you get your mass misinformation from what does it mean applause when you look at a meme is it truthful what does it mean today we take a look at a meme trend so powerful that it was recently mentioned by a congressman on the house floor more on that later but first let s take a look at this first meme so this masterpiece was recently shared by senator ted cruz in it we ve got three people playing will of fortune one with joe biden s face great photoshop skills by the way so the wheel of fortune board spells __ joe biden with a missing u and i and the caption reads i d like to solve the puzzle please let s go brandon hilarious ravi do you get this meme at all i get the __ joe biden part of it but who s brandon uh interesting question that s why i m here to make some sense of this because this really doesn t make any sense without the backstory so let s back up and talk about let s go brandon it s a trend taking over the conservative interwebs and it has its origins in something really strange and really stupid that took place a few weeks ago at the talladega super speedway in alabama a young racer named brandon brown won his first ever nascar race and in addition to the mass cases of people surviving alcohol poisoning something else happened there that would change the direction of political discourse in america for years to come oh my god this is a dream come true wow applause oh my god dad we did let s go applause oh my god it s just such an unbelievable moment brandon you also told me as you can hear the chance from the crowd music let s go brandon so if you couldn t hear it whale the rowdy crowd behind young brandon was chanting __ joe biden but the reporter either hard of hearing or trying to cover for the intoxicated bunch behind her decided to proclaim that the crowd was instead chanting let s go brandon now the right wing in their infinite wisdom has deemed this a key example of fake news a prime example of the mainstream media lying to our faces about something we can obviously hear and see and this event has inspired a host of new memes as conservatives across the land embraced the phrase let s go brandon as a new tongue in cheek way of saying __ joe biden while the maturity level of the right has sunk to a stunning almost prenatal new low at least their comedy skills are slightly improving right ravi i think so i left okay well that brings us back to senator ted cruz and this super professional meme this elected official shared on twitter so now we know let s go brandon really means __ joe biden and that pretty much explains why photoshop joe there is saying let s go brandon to solve this puzzle uh funny stuff right ravi i think so i mean yeah to me the only funny thing about this meme is the fact that biden has the lowest amount of money of the three contestants i mean that was a really nice touch at least whoever made this meme can you know they can math and this isn t the only let s go brandon meme out there this next gem taken from a parody of ryan reynolds new film free guy depicts biden saying let s go brandon while nothing but chaos ensues behind him it looks a little bit more like the summer of 2020 but you know it s open to interpretation who s the president then uh right and coming in with the classy touch we got the aoc met gala dress meme but oh wait look what someone did let s go brandon on the dress instead of tax the rich just so funny ravi isn t this just the best i think this is fair game corey unfortunately though let s go brandon has now left the world of the internet and is bleeding into real life there are let s go branding billboards amazon is selling let s go brandon flags and that s not all folks there s a song american screaming let s go brandon wow i haven t lost that many brain cells since the last time i walked past an outdoor wiz khalifa concert and if that wasn t bad enough a u s house representative bill posey of florida belted out let s go brandon at the end of his speech on the house floor they want you to help put america back where you found it and leave it to hell alone let s go brandon i yield back weak fist pump bro but it s nice to see that civil discourse is still alive and well in our nation s capital the washington post even had to print a retraction after it mistakenly reported that a georgia crowd during a donald trump junior rally burst into chance of let s go brandon when in fact the crowd was obviously screaming __ joe biden that s like the same thing that happened at the nascar race i mean the words __ and let s don t even rhyme how does this mistake keep happening so ravi is this meme tren funny or just plain sad i think in general this is fair game i think that this is america and saying __ the president is it s pretty american i think it s an american thing to do now i do think that if you re a member of congress i feel a little differently yeah and i also don t want to own whatever crazy __ goes along with this meme because i m sure there will be some racist things thrown alongside eventually right i think on the face of it some of this is really funny and it s kind of meta in a way that the left really isn t capable of right now yeah i mean but do you feel like this is just the downward spiral of civil discourse i mean um to to the right screen any where further left to go down though uh right is there any bottom i would say to the to the to the right s credit uh when donald trump first got in office uh there was a rapper late great nipsy hustle made a song called __ donald trump and so it was very similar to this trend except instead of like you know masking it they just actually say it __ donald trump but you didn t see politicians saying that you know democratic politicians saying that on the house floors well i remember when the representative said you lied to obama yeah and not too long ago that was the big scandal yeah whereas now they re essentially saying __ joe biden just like floyd the house on the floor yeah it just seems like they really can t handle uh losing that election yeah but on the face of all of this stuff i think it s okay and i think you could both laugh at it even if you re a biden supporter to say this is part of the political discourse that we have today and you could laugh and also still be a supporter of biden that s a valid point up next i sat down with congressman richie torres and he s going to talk about how he differs from progressives on key issues coming right up you told the new york times not too long ago that there s a sense that the media diminishes you do you mind just elaborating on that for us well there s a temptation to define me in relation to others and i feel like i have a compelling record of public service a compelling personal story and i have a right to be judged on my own merits on my own terms rather than in opposition to someone else yeah so i do resent the attempt to reduce me to a caricature or fit me into a larger political narrative um i insist on being my own person you know that article in many ways was juxtaposing you to the squad and i guess that s what you were saying was that that comparison is what you re just constantly getting one thing you said in that article was that you re practical and not ideological but i think based on what i know about you i wouldn t say you are without ideology but is it is it that your your ideology is the pragmatism i m not without ideology but i am without ideological purity test and for me the central value of progressivism ought to be progress and progress is measurable in the real world yeah so like one area where i am at odds with progressive orthodoxy is is my support for charter schools right if there is a charter school that enables students of color from places like the south bronx to academically outperform students from wealthier school districts i would see that as a manifestation of progress whereas there are others who would oppose it purely on ideological ground so i i m a progressive in the empirical sense of the word in the sense of valuing progress in the real world you know i would never let progressive purity be the enemy of real world progress why is it that white progressives have this disconnect from the rest of the party and why does it seem that that they re getting their way at a policy level you know for instance the house cutting federal funding for charters most recently like why are they winning that battle on the policy level there s a racial divide in attitudes towards charter schools right you know wealthier white progressives are much more skeptical ideologically skeptical about charter schools whereas people of color in places like the south bronx tend to be more supportive tend to be more willing to send their children to charter schools you know the reality of politics in america is that wealthier white progressive activists have more agenda setting power than black and brown people who represent the rank and file and core of the democratic party yeah and therein lies the disconnect and the vanguard is often unrepresentative of the masses and the vanguard is quick to speak for the masses without actually speaking to them you know if there are families in the south bronx who have determined that charter schools are the best option for their children who am i to tell them otherwise like who am i to tell them that i know what s best for your children i know better than you do yeah but that s not progressivism that s paternalism i m not indiscriminately supportive of charter schools but i care about well regulated charters i care about well whether a school is a traditional public school or charter school what i ultimately care about are results you know are we creating progress for students particularly students of color in places like the south bronx and there is a distinction between the michigan betsy devos model of charter schools which is for profit and deregulated and that to me is an utter debacle right and which is not what we have here exactly right whereas the new york city model is carefully regulated not for profit and is the gold standard uh that should be followed across the country yeah with strong results yes and strong quality control right you touch on this bigger set of themes where whether it s that david short interview with ezra klein or just tons of data coming out of the 2020 election there s this bigger conversation happening about a disconnect between the elites of the democratic party and the so called rank and file whether it s our rank and file or just working class voters generally and it seems like this question of charters and the disconnect between wealthy white progressives and black and brown families is part of a larger conversation we need to be having as a party about who s calling the shots here uh and you seem to be kind of at the tip of the spear here look a party whose members range from bernie sanders to joe manchin it lacks ideological coherence right it reminds me of the will rogers quote i m not a member of an organized political party i m a democrat um but like our greatest strength is diversity and our greatest weakness is diversity and managing that diversity has been a challenge as everyone is witnessing in real time in washington dc right but we have to address the divide that you re touching upon you know one more issue is defund police i think most rank and file democratic voters are practical and not ideological and would prefer to reform rather than defund police and here s what i resent if you re a white progressive activist from a wealthy neighborhood like park slope and you re advocating defunding police what happens if there s an outbreak of gun violence gang violence and youth violence right you live in a wealthy neighborhood so you re going to be comfortably ensconced right in an ivory tower right whereas it s people of color who will have to live with the consequences of your of your public policy choices and so that that s that s what i have a problem in fact what i would recommend is we should have neighborhood by neighborhood referenda and close the police precincts in those neighborhoods that that vote to defund police but yeah so if there are bastions of democratic socialism out there that wish to defund police let s close the police police out in those neighborhoods but i can assure you that no one wants to close the police precincts in mind and what s interesting about this is that if i were to be in most sort of progressive circles and i were to say i m pro charter and i m anti defunded police people would call that conservative whereas that those views seem to be largely held in the pockets that are some of the most democratic pockets uh in this country if you live on the echo chamber of twitter then yes right you would be correct in that characterization and so how do we break free of this echo chamber you know i think like obviously like people like you speaking out but what else because it feels to me like when these june 2020 moments happen the debate is immediately hijacked by a very small segment of the progressive coalition and there isn t like a consistent pushback that seems strong enough to give people cover or maybe not yet you know i think elected officials have to remind themselves that twitter is not the real world it s an alternate reality it s often a distortion of the real world a visible vocal minority of vanguard can be easily mistaken for the majority on twitter it can be a powerful platform for raising consciousness about progressive causes right you re one hashtag away from inspiring a social movement b2 i can t breathe black lives matters at the same time you know twitter can be a cesspool and the need for approval the need for retweets and likes can have a distorting effect on what you do as an elected official yeah that there s a sense in which instead of controlling twitter twitter can control you such an impressive guy right cory oh yeah absolutely she s definitely a rising star in the democratic party should definitely be getting a little bit more press because that s the type of candidate that could really get some votes outside of new york city right and uh we talk about so much more in our extended interview which is available on our youtube page uh he talks about affordable housing and he gets in greater depth on a number of issues including what s stopping democrats from attracting enough voters so you can check that out on our youtube page awesome looking forward to that coming up next a scandal at yale law school we ll be right back so ravi one thing that you didn t really mention in your opening when you were given your bio was that you actually went to law school didn t you yeah i went to yale law school but i don t really talk about it a lot i mean did you do anything yeah because i haven t practiced and my parents and you know my grandparents got on me about just never taking even the bar exam oh wow uh but you know interesting you should mention this because last night i had this weird dream where uh you know how like there are all these cancellations happening in the public uh i had this dream that i was a judge and i was adjudicating in like the public square like what should happen to these people who are so called cancelled and it was just really bizarre interesting you are about to enter judge ravi s cancellation courtroom the people are real the cases are real the rulings have no legal standing whatsoever order in the court all rise for judge robbie s cancellation court prosecution please state your case your honor today s case deals with something as old as time itself racism specifically racism in america we re dealing with a yale law school student a second year law school student who should know better by the way and he decided to throw a party for a constitution day nothing wrong with that right the only problem is his email that he sent out inviting people to this party he decided to frame this party as a trap house party he invited people to his trap house themed party where there would be popeye s chicken along with basic bitch themed american snacks counselor what s a trap house well your honor a trap house is a house in which people distribute and sell illegal narcotics but that s not the point the point is the term trap house has been closely associated with the african american community as a stereotypical term linking them to drugs and poverty essentially we believe this student was trying to invite people to a blackface party because the term trap house has been used as a code for blackface parties on college campuses for the past decade or so we believe that s also why he included the term basic __ themes tax implying that this would be a party for white people in which they would be in blackface and think about the compounded issue of offering popeye s chicken at a trap house thing party i mean papa s chicken the blackest of all the chicken restaurants clearly this was a racially insensitive email that was meant to trigger the black students of this university we believe this student should be punished for this your honor we believe he should first have to issue a formal apology to all of the black students on campus but we also believe that if he refuses to issue this apology that he should be removed from all of his leadership positions on any group on campus counselor what s the race of the student in question well your honor he s half cherokee half white fully racist counselor for the defense your turn your honor you know i might just be a small town lawyer from the sticks but when you grow up on a dairy farm you can smell the bull from a mile away and that s exactly what the prosecution is trying to push in this courtroom today bull your honor there was nothing inherently racist about my client s email he used the term trap house that is a commonly used term by his generation the the rappers of both the white and black persuasion use that term all the time think about the podcast chapel s trap house that s a left wing commie podcast that calls herself a trap house and nobody refers to it as racist i submit to you your honor exhibit a these lyrics i found on lyricgenius com went from sweating the blade now the stew is in the trap house yana those lyrics are from a rapper named g eazy who is as white as snow if a white rapper can say trap house and it s not racist then how come my student who is only half white can t say trap house in an email without being racist it is just a ludicrous claim we believe this is a witch hunt against my client because of his inclusion in the federalist society that s something the prosecution didn t mention did it he s in the federalist society this is a conservative organization and conservatism is under attack on college campuses all across america counselor one thing i can t get over is this reference to popeye s chicken next to the reference to basic __ snacks can you explain that popeyes is one of the closest restaurants to the place where the party was taking place nothing racist about it and as for the basic __ themed snacks this was a constitution day party he was simply just joking that the snacks were going to be american thing by saying they would be basic __ thing it was a joke your honor counselor why not just issue an apology it really doesn t cost that much if we start apologizing for every little term we use in the email what s next shawna we believe all the charges should be dropped from my client and we believe an apology is issued to him because this has been a very stressful time for him people calling them racist this man is not racist he just simply likes popeye s chicken okay thank you i ve heard enough i want to thank both counselors for the defense and the prosecution the function of this court is to solve problems that people in society aren t able to solve on their own and i just don t see a role of the court here i think i was persuaded by the defense uh especially in the evidence from is it g eazy uh and chapo trap house that the term trap house is widely used enough that i can t impute motive here and then we have this popeye s chicken situation and basic __ snacks and i would say this is the harder question um but i just don t know what the motive of the student was in question i certainly could be persuaded one way or another but i haven t heard anything definitive to say that this was out of malice and then we get to the remedy i just think that a insincere apology is worse than no apology at all and so i would hate for the court to force an apology in a situation like this and i would just encourage the students to talk this out wow ravi you got some really __ up dreams i mean what was that i mean yeah i got to stop taking cbd before i go to sleep man yeah i was like in it but it was like i was like two different people at once that s that s really weird you should stick to melatonin but uh coming up next the virginia s governor s race is coming up and how will critical race theory affect it music a strange thing is happening in virginia probably the key battleground in 2021 the percentage of voters in that state who rate education as their top issue has nearly tripled in just the past few weeks and as a former school principal and superintendent this initially got me really excited perhaps we re going to have the substantive discussion about how to improve kids lives and how to help our schools but that s not what s happening what s happening is a debate around this concept that you might have seen all around the news this concept of critical race theory the battle of a critical race theory in our public schools has become a major flash point in one place in particular ground zero the virginia governor s race that brings us to our segment what s actually happening with critical race theory what s actually happening what is this critical race theory or crt as they say well its origins go back 40 years to law schools around the country and it was really like a term only used in academic journals and it meant uh that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice but it s something embedded in our legal systems and in our policies and so an example of this is in the 1930s there was this concept of redlining when the government would draw lines around areas that they deemed poor financial risks and often they were drawing these lines based on race and then banks would refuse to offer loans to black people living in those neighborhoods and those patterns live on today even if today s policies are facially race blind and so the concept seems pretty cut and dry right no the problem is when people talk about critical race theory today they re grouping many things together new terms like white fragility and anti racism old terms like identity politics culturally relevant teaching diversity equity inclusion and they re also including a teaching of america s historic floods and you need a degree in sociology or history even to keep up with all of this and some of these concepts overlap and many reasonable people can disagree about each of these different things so for example i think it s really important to teach about america s complicated history and its dark history but i m also pretty skeptical of the book white fragility for instance and don t think that belongs anywhere near children the problem we have is that neither side of this debate is being particularly disciplined or precise when they talk about this concept so i m going to attempt to demystify this concept for you as the audience and i m going to start by talking about the critics of critical race theory it s mainly on the right and when i see the critics of critical race theory i mean the critics of all the things i just talked about and how they lump it together by and large their biggest criticism is that when people use all these terms they focus on group identity over universal universal shared traits and values meaning they focus on race and gender instead of what makes us american what makes us live in the same community what makes us have certain belief systems they also are worried that there s discrimination against white people embedded in some of these theories they also worry that there s a relativism about the way we use language and that all terms that we use are somehow instruments of power where the most extreme version of that that i ve seen is that some people are advocating that the teaching of for instance the scientific method is racist because white people came up with the term uh they also believe that uh some of these critics that teaching people some of these concepts means you re teaching them to hate america so those are just some of their criticisms and what an example of the the you know in in the minutia what they re worried about is in cupertino for example there was an elementary school where a third grade class was forced to quote deconstruct their racial identities and then rank themselves according to their power and privilege i mean what could go wrong here and to be clear that example i couldn t find too many examples of stuff like that i think what is uh i think a bigger issue when we look at that sort of ranking of all the different terms are theories about how we use standardized testing and data to drive instruction which are sometimes linked together with critical race theory and ben shapiro recently went on bill maher and talked about this let s roll that clip the fifth largest school district in america clark county just decided that they were going to lower standards with regard to testing because they wanted to alleviate disparities in outcomes that is an outgrowth of critical race theory can you draw a straight line to it yes 100 because when you say that the meritocracy is an outgrowth of white supremacy and then you suggest that i m somehow denying that slavery took place or that your great great grandfather was a hero because i m saying that i want people tested when they are in school to see if they are good at school there s a lot i disagree with ben shapiro on but actually he and i are probably in agreement on this particular criticism which is that there are ideas that are prominent on the left sometimes being grouped together with critical race theory as a terminology you know ibram candy for example who wrote how to be anti racist they re they re critics of standardized testing of the use of data to drive instruction or even acknowledging a so called achievement or opportunity gap who call all those ideas racist meaning acknowledging the realities of our schools and i m with the spurs of the world who think that we need that standardized testing we need that data we need to acknowledge the gaps in our schools in order to improve them that s an important debate but the problem for the shapiros of the world and the critics of critical race theory is that uh when people talk about doing something about it they go too far so young can for example who s the gop nominee for the virginia governor s seat says he wants to ban critical race theory and in his ads he has for instance one of his most recent ads he had a woman who has uh historically advocated for banning the toni morrison book beloved from schools and there are 27 states that have introduced legislation to quote ban critical race theory and eight states of past legislation to ban it and some of these laws are really crazy in wisconsin for example they passed a bill that prohibits the use of over 90 items and terms in schools you d need a phd to even interpret this law florida s school board issued guidelines saying that you quote may not define american history as something other than the creation of a new nation based on largely based on the universal principles stated in the declaration of independence translation uh you can t teach anything other than the aspirations of this country it s like saying if you re in a relationship with somebody that they can t acknowledge any of your actions they can only talk about your promises that s absurd and tennessee the state where i used to run schools had a terrible law as well they were banning teaching anything that could lead an individual to quote feel discomfort guilt anguish or any other form of psychological distress because of their race or sex so these are problematic laws and some people who are critical of some of the sub components of critical race theory so some people like me who ve been critical of white fragility and anti racism etc people like thomas chatterton williams and camilla foster took to the pages of the new york times to say look we have some problems with some of these other concepts but these laws are problematic because a fair reading of our history is going to make people uncomfortable and we need to preserve the ability to tell an accurate history of the united states and they talked about how if this law was on the books in germany they wouldn t be able to teach for instance about their terrible history with the holocaust and and have their students uh acknowledge that history and do something about it and so these laws go too far they are dangerously imprecise uh and it is much more common for states and districts to mandate what is taught that s what we call curriculum standards versus what isn t taught which is really unusual to to prohibit things within the classroom uh and this term critical race theory it s grown to include such a broad category of things that it s basically meaningless so when people use the terms you really need to drill them down as to what they actually mean by it and the tragic thing here is that somewhere in this debate there s an important discussion about how we discuss privilege how we group students together how we think of diversity but the laws being proposed here go way beyond any of that to mandate an inaccurate reading of american history and to sidestep the important conversations we should be having as a society yeah i just learned a lot i mean i don t i didn t know what critical race theory was uh but some of this just seems really extreme from both sides i mean when you ve got the left trying to teach third graders to rank themselves based off their power and privilege that sounds ridiculous but it also sounds ridiculous for tennessee to pass a law saying that you can t talk about anything that makes you uncomfortable uh about race or gender i mean that means you can t talk about women s suffrage that means you can t talk about slavery or anything like that it just doesn t make any sense i think both sides are just taking this way too extreme and they re just using our schools as a battlefield for their culture war right and i think in this case i was not able to find enough examples to merit i think a hysteria around this like although there are examples of pedagogy like that third grade class that i didn t like um it doesn t seem like there s this epidemic that s being described and i think what s really going on here is that the suburbs are these battlegrounds so there s this county i didn t mention called loudoun county in virginia which is the critical battleground in virginia and it s one of the most affluent counties in america but it also happens to be the county in virginia that was the last to integrate and it s the site of all this stuff and i don t have enough time to go into it but essentially i think the gop strategists view an opportunity in the suburbs to push on this issue and i think that s what s going on and i think if they re successful on tuesday you will see this as a playbook around the country absolutely well i think that brings us to the end of our first episode thank you all for sticking around with us for so long uh make sure to subscribe to our youtube channel check out our podcast on spotify apple music wherever you get your podcast from we re going to be doing this every

debate a show for political eclectics i m robbie gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlotz well cory what do we have today well coming up biden celebrates one year in office with near record low approval ratings we dive into our theories as to why biden isn t resonating with voters then people are outraged after warriors part owner said that nobody cares about china s repression of uyghurs was he out of line or just telling the truth then ravi gives us his take on why the new york attorney general s investigation into the trump organization is compromised and finally ricky brings us the latest on road back covet 19 restrictions in england but first things first let s talk a little bit about what s going on in florida lawmakers there are continuing their battle against critical race theory republicans advance the individual freedom bill this week it aims to prevent private businesses and schools from compelling anyone to believe they are responsible for the past actions of their race or should be forced to feel discomfort or guilt on account of their race or sex critics of the bill say it amounts to censorship and could lead to frivolous lawsuits i am telling you this is going to open up the floodgates to frivolous lawsuits you re convoluting the what discrimination is you can t say someone feels guilty about other people s discrimination and now they can sue under discrimination his supporters however say the bill would make sure students aren t being indoctrinated i think the most important thing is to make sure that we have accurate history that we teach the dark periods of our history just like we teach the the good periods of our history and at the same time we assure that we re not indoctrinating our students to start off with the premise that we are a racist country now the associated press ran an article on the bill that read florida could shield whites from discomfort of racist past news outlets picked it up across the country though the bill never explicitly mentions white people or even race in that manner so um robin ricky i mean the florida gop is pushing this bill and as far as i know republican party has always been about free speech local control small government i don t see any of that going on with this bill so what is what is going on here you know what s interesting in this discussion is we ve each played a critical role in education system very recently and i was the school principal and superintendent you re a parent ricky you re probably most recently in school um i think just coming out of the university last month so i think we all have experience with the school system i think we bring that lens here and i think as a school principal whose kids were 90 plus percent african american kids in the south i think of this both from the perspective of the kind of discussions you want kids to have within school buildings but also just how easy or hard it is to run a school and i have a few problems with this piece of legislation with that lens in mind number one is that in the legislation it says an individual by virtue of his or her race or sex does not bear responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex and i think what i take issue with here is the word responsibility because if they had replaced it with fault i would have been this this legislation would have resonated with me more meaning people aren t at fault for things that people have done in the past but i think we re all responsible for them in the sense that you know the fault is about things that maybe we didn t have any control about so it s not your fault but we re all citizens of this country and we should want uh to rectify those things because we and and i think that we should in our schools we should be uh that should be like a central point of focus in our civics lesson it s like how do we actually wrap our arms around this difficult past that we ve had and actually make it better leading into the future i agree with that and i also think you know i m i m a little sympathetic to the idea behind the bill because i do i mean i saw myself i was in school being segregated out into affinity groups and sent to different buildings to talk to people of different races about racial issues on mlk day of all days in my high school which felt a little ironic so i ve seen how there are problematic things that are happening in schools but i as especially as a libertarian i don t like this bill specifically um because it s i do think that it s probably constitutional for k 12 teachers because they don t really have a lot of first amendment rights when they re in their duties but i don t like that it s applying to private businesses as well and i especially don t like that it s about how someone feels rather than the intent i think that intent is a pretty clear kind of metric of if i intend to intimidate you based on an immutable characteristic that could be potentially problematic versus if you feel that way and you know i do agree with the idea that this could lead to frivolous lawsuits that are completely subjective um so i don t like the i think there s there s some merit to what they re trying to go after but i don t like the mechanism that they re doing it and i also think that you know school birds and smaller scale solutions are always better in a more decentralized kind of way it seems as though when you look at the language of this build it doesn t mention critical race theory but when it talks about things like making sure people don t feel guilt and that kind of brings up this idea of white guilt and it talks about things about making sure we re not teaching that one side is more privileged than another just because of their race or sex so it seems like they re definitely targeting what the conversation about critical race theory has been about over these last few months i think this question of white privilege is so tricky because any one individual could be more or less privileged than another be you know like there s a low income white for example who s less privileged than me as a brown person in this country uh undoubtedly i ve met many of those people and so it would be insulting to that person for me to tell them that they re you know they ve got some privilege that i don t have like i m sure that there are certain rooms that they can walk into where they re accepted more than i am but i feel like it s often a very sloppy conversation uh and so i don t want that world where we re just telling people in these very large uh you know sort of sloppy and um kind of uh general ways who they are and who they aren t and we re not trying to be more precise but at the same time i also wouldn t want a classroom to be barred from talking about systemic issues that people face or trends or wealth gaps and you know the tie between slavery and the economic conditions that we have today i think that s a part of the country that we live in and i think students can handle that teachers can handle that and i think any effort to shield people from those discussions makes them worse citizens and it makes it harder for us to solve some of these problems and i totally agree with ricky that you know this thing is so vague and subjective you know i was i was thinking about ben shapiro last time i checked his twitter feed it says facts don t care about your feelings and what i m wondering is like what what does he have to say about this law because this is all about feelings and not about facts like as ricky said like it s all has to do with like if if whether or not the intent or even what s in the lesson if you feel for instance anguish and guilt over a lesson over our failures and reconstruction or our dark history with slavery then there s a cause of action here like is that that s kind of what this law seems to imply well manny diaz jr the florida lawmaker who s basically pushed this bill basically was saying that the bill aims to prevent teachers from forcing people to feel a certain way based off of history but doesn t prevent them from teaching these things in history and i just think back to like when i was in the sixth grade i had a teacher who was big on teaching about the civil war because i was in fifth grade or sixth grade in alabama so we learned a lot about the civil war and i remember them asking the question the war of northern aggression uh yes something like that the war between the states and i remember him asking a question to these kids who did not was our first you know lesson into the civil war and he was like what is the civil war battle that marked the turning point for the union and all the kids raised their hand said gettysburg gettysburg editor you re all wrong and i raised my hand and said oh no it s vicksburg and he s like how did you know that and i was like this is the third time i ve had to learn about civil war and i had to learn about it like 4 out of 12 grades in alabama and yet we re trying to make it where oh we can t make people feel uncomfortable because we don t want to talk about slavery we don t want to talk about the 1619 project but it s like you re not supposed to feel comfortable when you learn about history you re supposed to learn it and learn from it and i feel like this bill is aimed at it could be aimed at really removing any teachings about slavery any teachings about jim crow laws any teachings about reconstruction because any of that can make you feel uncomfortable and it can also be used in the other direction i mean an african american or someone who s hispanic could say well this conversation makes me feel uncomfortable so they could use this legislation to say well then you know i m going to sue this school because they taught a certain lesson that made me feel uncomfortable so this is going on a really simply soap in my opinion i want to agree with one thing that that ricky said you know based on her experience just being in the school system and i left being a superintendent in 2016 and uh and i totally agree with what you re saying and i think this goes too far uh there is a problem out there to be solved i think it s being there s so many things lumped together with critical race theory right it s you know there s legitimate lessons of history which you re talking about there are diversity equity inclusion trainings there are things like inherent bias training intersectionality like and these concepts keep changing and it s often hard to pin people down and what they mean as a an educator i saw some of the earlier versions of this before we called it crt in these public debates and i think there s a lot of bad uh pedagogy going on out there like i remember like i would fight with tfa for example which went from an reform oriented organization to an organization that was training like what they saw as activists and what they and what they were interpreting as activism within the classroom was teaching uh their teachers and you know like uh creating a sort of perception that skills like math reading emphasis um high behavioral expectations extended school days even standardized testing are all racist tools of oppression and they re and they re basically taking a lot of privileged white kids and you know largely liberal kids putting them into largely uh classrooms uh you know where there s mostly people of color in the south teaching them to feel guilty about it and manifest that guilt by questioning whether we should be teaching people skills or not or having high expectations of everybody in the classroom and to me that s pernicious should it be outlawed no like we should debate it we should discuss it we should confront it uh i think outlying it does nearly nothing because then you re gonna have your blue states doubled down on it the red states won t have it um private schools like you know who knows in this bill i guess they wouldn t be able to do it either and i think we should just put the stuff surface it i think people on the left should acknowledge this stuff exists i ve spent a lifetime on the left i mean i ve been in so many rooms where versions of these theories have dominated and you cannot question them lest you be accused of racism so they are real but are they as real to the extent that people are describing i looked really hard to find too many examples in florida i couldn t i mean there were a couple of examples that came to the surface but this doesn t seem to be an epidemic in florida yeah i mean i think that the most important thing to remember in k to 12 is that like the courts have helped that students have freedom of conscience and as soon as a teacher is taking sort of an activist indoctrination stance rather than just presenting facts that could potentially be violating their rights because at a public school they are a captive audience the it s a compulsory attendance sort of situation um but at the same time you know i think you know academic freedom doesn t apply to k 12 in the same way that it does with higher education but especially this conversation about rooting out specific conversations in higher ed that s super concerning to me and and dancing around history or re orienting it now because there s a potential that you d be held liable for making people uncomfortable is really um concerning and i think that a potential solution is for a bill like this to say you know you can t do affinity groups in public schools like that would be a specific targeted issue that is divisive and that could be clearly proven if someone did it or i mean i guess that could be debated but you know you need to have more specific depth to bills like this so you don t end up chilling speech because that s the worst thing you can possibly do you re a fellow at fire right the foundation for individual rights and education and correct me if i m wrong fire came out against a different bill in florida that uh i think it required professors to or like it it protected the right of students to to uh record their professors what was that all about i m not sure yeah to be honest but i do actually i pulled a i do know that they came against a florida bill but i did pull a quote from greg luciano who s the president of fire responding to bills that are worded exactly like this one and he said frivolous lawsuits are always an issue when speech restrictions focus on concepts characterized by subjective reaction like discomfort or guilt without making absolutely clear that the regulation is targeting behavior intended to create that response in students so he s the organization under the president has explicitly come down against uh bills that are just subjectively um coming against speech that makes people feel uncomfortable so but i m not i m sorry i can t speak to that specific yep uh bill well now on to our next story joe biden marks one year in office today but nobody seems to be celebrating his approval ratings are in the tank just under 42 percent despite overseeing a rebound in the job market passing a cove 19 relief bill and a landmark infrastructure package and getting nearly two thirds of americans fully vaccinated the country is struggling with decades high inflation and a never ending pandemic so let s just open up this to a conversation why do people hate joe biden so much well i think they hate him well i think that biden is not in as bad shape as we think and i m going to play my role here as a former democratic staffer and i m an emphasis on former because we re a c3 but 538 puts biden s approval rating today uh at 41 9 percent trump interestingly was at 39 5 at the same time but pretty much historically biden is in pretty bad shape you know obama was 49 8 at this period w was 81 2 you know this is post 911 clinton was 56 5 reagan was 48 9 so uh biden is definitely in bad shape but i do want to point out that the last president was even worse and came rather close to winning re election and so this is by no means dispositive for biden but i think if for thinking about democrats they ve got very little time between now and the midterms to change perceptions uh and we ll talk about what s driving those perceptions in a second but uh and second though but by the time he biden gets to re election there is historical precedence for major swings between the end of your first year in office uh and the uh the re elect like i looked at a couple of examples you know so george w went from above 80 to about 50 on election day so this was a negative swing his father had a very similar swing post iraq war uh reagan on the other hand is an example of how you go up so reagan was about 50 and then was above 60 by election day and obviously he won his re election and so there is precedent for major swings one way or the other and so uh if i were in the sort of metaphorical locker room with democrats i would say you know put your chin up and get focused on um you know just continue the work uh but if i were in the republican locker room i d probably be feeling pretty good at halftime here what are some of the major criticisms as far as just job performance i mean as far as what biden promised he promised to obviously get covet 19 under control which hasn t done that but he also promised a return to normalcy uh kind of mirrors like 1920 that same election there was a guy who promised to return to normalcy not a word by the way um but i mean has he done that is is this normal i mean i think it s a little strange to a lot of voters that he campaigned as sort of a moderate back to the old school way kind of candidate but then he has rolled out the most progressive agenda in presidential history so that s an inconsistency and i think that there were a lot of people that voted for him hoping that it would feel like a cohesive united nation again going back to a guy who s been around the block since like he was a baby basically in politics and i i mean i don t think that s what we ve gotten i think we ve gotten some some very progressive uh bills passed and some also i mean we also at the same time haven t gotten bill back better or the voting rights bill which was promised to people on the left but then we have the immigration crisis there is the issue in afghanistan every single day people are paying way more for their groceries and we re printing money kind of endlessly and looking to print more which could exacerbate inflation even further there s supply chain issues there s the issue of covid and how you know we were promised tests from essentially day one that biden got in office and now we only just got around to that and it takes seven to twelve days to actually get the test to you which feels a little counterproductive so i think that there s a lot of promises made and not kept i mean for me personally as a libertarian the biggest one was saying there won t be a vaccine mandate and then there was a vaccine mandate and then our supreme court had to go through the whole process of shooting that down like that sort of thing is pretty disappointing one thing i hear in in what you re saying ricky s a little bit of a catch 22 which is like he he wants to do all these progressive things but one of the reason why we re scoring him is not successful is because he didn t pass all those oh yeah i think it s different factions like from the left he s his approval rating is low across the board right from my vantage point as a libertarian like i don t i want like almost no government spending i don t want the the federal government to grow in size and that s i mean that s just those are my personal qualms but from the people on the left that s a pretty big uh loss and for the people on the right there are a whole other swath of issues and then for the people in the middle who just kind of wanted like a steady middle of the road guy in some ways that s not what we re getting let me defend biden a little bit here so uh you know carville famously said it s the economy stupid and i actually think that uh as we sit right now especially if if you think about like if the key drivers of inflation in the supply chain like this is the big if if those mitigate over the course of the next year and biden maintains uh the economic recovery uh you know and thinking about unemployment for example is that 3 9 percent right now from 6 7 percent a year before that uh real wages even after taking into account inflation are actually up for the lowest third of americans uh it s the the upper two thirds that are actually struggling more uh in terms of wage plus inflation which is counterintuitive to even some of the reporting that we ve done recently um so let s say that the economic recovery continues but the supply chain and inflation issues mitigate that to me is this the key to biden getting out of this mess because the economy is drives uh you know voter perception so much but then he s gotten the infrastructure bill passed he s gotten more judges confirmed than any president since reagan in his first year um he promised 100 million vaccine doses in the first hundred days and he exceeded that so if you look at his record you com you put that all on one side and that s super positive and obviously there are a lot of shortcomings there s afghanistan um there s been the herky jerky cdc uh you know almost erratic communication and policy changes there s the obviously major rises inflation and then the simple fact that biden can t complete a sentence in any way that s lucid and compelling to the american voters and so i think this is an even fight right now between biden and himself yeah since about 2017 we ve had to struggle with a president being able to complete sentences but i just want to i just want to pull this back all of the stuff you just said is great but inflation being as high as it is it s higher now than it has been since like the 70s or at least the early 80s and all the gains we ve made whether it s the stimulus checks that were passed whether it was higher wages whether it s lower unemployment none of that matters if our dollar isn t stretching more like if we re having to pay more then all of that is pretty much it s pretty much a zero sum like it s just it doesn t it doesn t matter but also when it comes to the presidency a lot of it is about image and right now joe biden s image is corrupted one by a lot of things that ricky was saying that he promised to be this middle of the road guy and yet we hear a lot of divisive language from him i mean the voting rights thing i agree with the voting rights bill but to say that if you don t agree with it you re jefferson davis i mean that s a very extreme statement and that s not going to bring anybody together that s not going to convince anybody on the other side or in the middle to then support voting rights because you re just going to push them further away so him doing things like that is very problematic but also just like i said there s just an image problem with joe biden and he can t combat this because the left wants him the left you know the democrat party is controlled by sort of moderate left but the left left like the loony left they control social media and that controls the perception of things and they don t like joe biden they don t like uh kamala harris they think that they re just you know these corporate democrats and they don t think that they re true progressives and the right literally wants him to fail because that ll make them you know look better when it comes to elections so there s really no there s like he s damned if he do damned if he doesn t in this particular case especially when you look back at biden s record i think that s an issue with the left particularly because he he was one of the architects of the crime bills in the 90s he was one of the architects of the student loan debt that now he s campaigning to forgive and so there s a long track record kind of discrepancy with him but um one thing that i really feel like ends up getting missed in these conversations about kind of like dunking on presidents or uh promoting your own side is that ultimately as americans in the end like even if it s not your party even if even if you re dissatisfied with biden this far like we should all be rooting for his approval rating to improve for this country to get better and not like worrying about anything other than just america succeeding in our president who s at the helm that the people elected succeeding ultimately yeah i think on the biden stuff about his record like he part of it is he s been in the senate i think since before i was born certainly before you two were born yeah he had to wait until his birthday to get sworn in because he was that young when he got elected third he s so old yeah now he s a little bit but part of that and this is it and i feel like i m the press secretary for biden here and so i m it s almost embarrassing but the he i would want him to evolve you know that s part of it is like i i would want him to grow and change his positions over that period of time and in many ways to me that would be his litmus test to stay in office now that being said everything positive i ve said about biden i think it would be really smart for biden for the country uh to not run again i think it would be a shame if we had a replay of the you know that you know 70 80 year old versus the 78 year old again i think if if biden didn t run and trump didn t run and we made room for new blood within these elections i i think most americans would be happy with that experience and you know maybe some new ideas some new energy you know shave a couple decades off of the you know the the average age of the people running this country like i think that would be welcome because i think as much as i m i m straining to talk about the positives of his first hundred or his first year um nobody who s honest can look at him and say this is the best that we ve got in this country right now and i m sure like if you pressed him he d probably admit that too well as long as we just don t say let s go brandon i think we had a really constructive conversation about this particular issue now on to a video that is causing backlash across twitter the nba s golden state warriors are distancing themselves from part owner chamaf paliapattia this week after the billionaire said this nobody cares nobody cares about what s happening to the weakers okay you you bring it up because you really care and i think what do you mean the rest of us don t care i m just telling you very hard you re saying you personally don t care i m telling you a very hard ugly truth okay of all the things that i care about yes it is below my line okay of all the things that i care about it is below my line if you re not familiar the uyghurs are a muslim ethnic minority group that has faced serious repression from the chinese government for years now well over a million uyghurs have been imprisoned in re education camps they re subject to rape sterilization and forced labor much of the world including the u s has condemned china s campaign as outright genocide but the nba notably has not the organization rakes in 5 billion a year from their partnerships in china and because of that the nba like most american businesses does everything in its power to steer clear of having a stance on the uyghur crisis now the warriors say polyapothea s views certainly don t reflect those of their organization but make no statement of their own on the situation in xinjiang the province in china where this is taking place so was the billionaire s comments reprehensible or a tough to swallow truth on how americans view this situation what do we what do we think about this well i think obviously we should all care about what s happening and uh whether we call it a genocide or just a like a incredibly nasty and evil crackdown on a group of people because of their ethnicity and their religion whatever you define it as in the u s has called it a genocide uh it s horrible and we should care and so he s wrong to not care but he is not alone um he goes at the end of this he said uh he goes i stand for me at the end of this uh interview and the one thing i want to give him credit for is that he s one of the only honest people i ve heard about this because i think so many people were clutching their pearls on the internet saying i can t believe you said this i can t believe you said this and what i would want to know from those people is do you buy goods from nike apple coca cola adidas calvin klein campbell soup costco you know you can go down the list and say like there s so many corporations in this country that we all depend upon that have problematic ties to that region and haven t cleansed themselves of their connection to that regime the perpetrators of this violence and we re all complicit in it and i i what i want to know from the people who get upset at him is like what are you going to do like what are you going to do to help solve this problem and if you do nothing it s functionally the same as not caring i think there s there s a difference in saying i don t care and saying i can t fix this though and i think that there would have been there are a lot of different ways that he could have taken this and said you know listen you re asking me about this because i m a minority owner of one mba team i can t fix the world s problems i m donating to xyz cause i m i have charitable uh things that i do in my life and i i can t fix the weaker problem that would have been totally fine with me but he s also wrong in saying that nobody cares 70 of americans say that they d rather take some financial losses and pay more for goods in order to stand up to the human rights abuses in china so people do care and you know the people who can actually make a difference are people in c suites that are in these corporations that could swallow a little bit of a shaving off of their margin and it s not you and i and so to hear somebody with financial power say something like that is pretty disturbing although i would say one small wrinkle is that with the nba they re china s consuming their product versus with a company like nike like we re really talking about like a profit margin which is really disturbing in the end yeah and with nike you know there was this uyghur uh forced labor protection act which passed congress and i want to be careful with my words here it s nike apple coca cola lobbied the bill i don t want to say lobbied against the bill because who the heck knows what happens behind the scenes here but it seems a little bit shady and basically what was happening was you know bipartisan bill passed essentially to force companies to break ties with this region uh it seems like what happens in china is like the supply chain is really murky and so these companies didn t want too stringent of rules applied to them but what s clear to me is that these companies fight this stuff all the way to the bitter end and there s some really depressing examples like intel for example issued a letter to its supplier saying that it was going to stop sourcing in the region but then people in china started protesting them and they rescinded they issued an apology for their previous statement and there s another company the parent company is our there was a very similar incident there where basically they find a backbone for a second and then they quickly recede into the background and the nba is particularly bad here because he s a minority owner of the golden state warriors they issued a kind of general statement saying that that uh he doesn t speak for them but what they didn t say is what their actual position is on this and that s not an accident yeah because they ve got billions of dollars at stake here and this reminds me of the lebron situation with you know daryl mori the gm of the rockets who called out uh china over the human rights in in hong kong said he stood with the protesters and all these people in the nba from steve kerr to pop this lebron james who have so much to say about so many things both domestically and around the world couldn t find their words on uh hong kong and china uh why because it s in their financial interests to be quiet in this and that s depressing yeah i think that s even worse than what shemoth did like i d rather someone just be like honestly i don t care than to care and then say oh wait i uncare now that it matters financially to me like i actually think that s worse lebron criticized mori yeah he was the one who was ignorant on hong kong gross that pisses me off look polly apatia is wrong to say nobody cares i mean ricky just gave us a stat that clearly people in this country do care about this and he was also wrong if he doesn t care he s just morally wrong however i think there is a ton of hypocrisy going on here i saw people like tucker carlson and senator tom cotton out of arkansas really doubling down throwing this guy under the bus and the reality is what china is doing to the uyghurs is disgusting it is abhorrent but it mirrors what the united states did to the indigenous population in this continent period and we got people in florida that are trying to wipe that from the history books so if we re going to stand up for human rights then let s be consistent about it i d like to hear what tucker carlson has to say about what s going on in burma or what s going on in on in congo or in south sudan or in ethiopia or in all these other countries where there are genocides taking place there are human rights abuses taking place and there are human rights abuses taking place right here in the united states of america i mean we had a interview about what s going on in alabama s prison system it s about to get taken over by the federal government because people are literally dying in there because of the type of human rights abuses that are happening their eighth amendment abuses as well and so if you re going to be you know stand up and speak out against a guy like this because he said something ignorant regarding china s human rights abuses i m all for it but then be consistent i don t like the selective outrage because they re really just doing that for political reasons in my opinion right yeah and following up to what ricky said too how much do we credit people for acknowledging something versus doing something about it right so like i m trying to think of like what how do we treat the 70 plus of people who say they would make a trade off you can make a trade off like there are websites you can go to where you can find out where materials are there are human rights groups that make recommendations on on products you could purchase you could just wear all h m all the time do people do that they don t i don t do that so i m an effing hypocrite and uh on this issue and that s what i m trying to say is like when i look at him my instinct is to be like __ this guy and then i m like well what functionally is different about the way i live my life than the way this guy lives life other than he has billions of dollars and i don t i still have a lot more money than most people on this planet and i don t make the right choice but i want to like and the question is like is the energy well spent going after this guy and dunking on him or is it well spent looking inward and saying how do i actually figure out where my money is going and is it going to the right place absolutely the man in the mirror that s where that s where it has to start yeah i m asking him to make a change yes yes take a look at yourself and make a change now on to our next story tisch james and trump so ravi what is going on here with her investigation uh into the trump organization well listeners uh and youtube watchers if you hated what i had to say about biden you might love this particular segment uh so here s what s going on here so the new york attorney general s tish james she has responsibility over the civil case against the trump organization and the manhattan district attorney alvin bragg who s appeared on the show has responsibility over the criminal case and as full disclosure i helped elect alvin bragg and when he was on the show i pushed him um on what i saw as a conflict of interest in that case or at least some bias that was present in the election and my issue here is tish james just announced that there s been significant progress in this case uh i m not going to go into too much detail about what this case is about it basically has to do with trump inflating his assets in order to get favorable loans and she seems to be signaling that she thinks she has him on a civil case on this and is going to be calling him uh to testify uh all of this to me is secondary to the fact that tish james herself has a major problem in overseeing this case because when she ran for office for this attorney general position in 2018 and multiple occasions she signaled that she was going to go after trump she used general language about how like trump needed to worry about her and that she was going to shine a light on like you know all of his books essentially and find his wrongdoing and they weren t specific claims she wasn t like there s this one like piece of evidence that people are ignoring this one crime that he did she was basically i m going to examine his history of criminal practice and get to the bottom of it this is a problem because generally speaking when you run for a position a legal position a political legal position you should not make general claims about individuals and that you want to go after them right that s like if i were uh running for you know prosecutor in staten island and i said you know what you know vito facilla who s like a republican standout i think he s a criminal and i m gonna make sure that we hold him accountable and then i get into office and i basically have a traffic cop follow him everywhere you go so i can get him you know catch him doing something wrong so there s precedence for this and when the shoe is on the other foot democrats during the trump administration matthew whitaker became the acting attorney general and he had previously made prejudicial statements about the mueller investigation and one democrat after another whether it s nancy pelosi chuck schumer jerry nadler attorneys general around the country wrote letters saying this guy needs to recuse himself and they were applying a principle to whitaker that they refused to apply in this situation and so do i think trump has broken some law it would not surprise me but it in the end when you re talking about prosecuting anybody especially the former president united states everything needs to be clean this is not a clean investigation she needs to recuse herself and i think the fact that she has gone this far without recusing herself means to me that this entire investigation is suspect uh and it really worries me very sus very such indeed it just reminds me of the democrats have done this before with trump they did this with the mueller investigation this thing of oh we re gonna find this smoking gun we re gonna find this thing against trump and then when that fizzled out it was like oh never mind and then you know the whole ukraine thing happened and that was a much more serious accusation a much more serious possible crime that trump committed but then it didn t have as much of an effect because people were like well you ve done this before you ve said this before with the mueller investigation and then the same thing with the gen 6 stuff it doesn t have as much effect when you constantly go into office i mean there were people there was a senator um i think he was a congressman out of texas uh his name was al greene not singer and he was like i m we re gonna impeach trump like he came in like in 2017 saying we re going to impeach trump for no reason and so it s like when you keep saying that over and over and over again then when there s actual you know it s like crying wolf when there s actually something there people don t believe it because you ve just spent your whole time saying you re gonna do this against this person just because they re politically different from you yeah and a lot of my friends on the left will say well he he needs to you know he needs to abide by the law like anybody else but the the very fact of some some of these accusations uh to me like she said during i think this was during her acceptance she said i will shine a light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings every dealing so yeah like everybody needs to abide by the law but like are you are you actually like like are you examining every aspect of this person s life to find the wrong doing or is the wrong doing brought to you and you re just following up on it these are the questions i would want to ask yeah definitely i mean from my vantage point it does sound a bit like a witch hunt and i would say that on either side whether or not i like trump or whatever candidate it is that that should never be a motivated sort of way of going after someone but i m curious is there like any way that you think we can prevent people from campaigning on promises like this going forward yeah well one thing i told a left leaning audience uh about you know earlier this year or last year was imagine a situation where somebody runs for attorney general of arkansas a republican on the promise to go after the clintons and in that situation let s say they won and then they then open a civil and then criminal investigation of hillary clinton bill clinton the clinton foundation etc how would you feel so i think this is important as people to have the shoe on the other foot now you re supposed to have like you know bar associations etc that hold people accountable to this kind of stuff but they re so politicized and i think it s safe to say that the new york bar is not filled with a lot of trump fans and so i m not sure what they ve had to say about this but i would be surprised if they had too much to say about this and you know when we had alvin bragg on the show that man d a i pushed him on this too it s just you know i supported him in that campaign and i think that you know i continue to think and his office is not too far from here that he needs to recuse himself from that too because that s even more serious that s the criminal investigation and so uh and honestly i love alvin but his answer was not very satisfactory i ve been thinking about it a lot since you know he said i promised i would go after him so basically he s saying i promise i d go after her but i need to keep my campaign promise and i m just like this is the opposite of how this is supposed to work and it s not legitimate and i would say that as much as inflating your real estate assets in order to get a favorable loan uh sounds like the kind of thing that s wrong i m not sure it rises to the level of the kind of thing that we should be locking up a form of prizes in the united states in such a highly politicized environment for like i just even even if you put aside how this even came about in front of us it just doesn t feel right to me so let s move on to a story that ricky is going to tell us about what is going on in england so yesterday bars johnson announced that for england and not the entirety of the uk they are going to roll back pretty much all major uh covid lockdown measures that they have in place mass mandates are going away vaccine passports are going away and there s no more recommendation to work from home and so he also said to parliament yesterday that this is essentially a concession that we re going to have to learn to live with covet like it s the flu because omicron is sort of past its peak in england now and so i m really excited about this because i i was worried that now that we have a kind of shifting um danger that s facing us with kovid that leaders might not respond to the most pragmatic way and might still be holding on to some of the restrictions and the power with that but this is kind of evidence that we re actually responding to an evolving threat and so i m curious to hear what you guys have to say well it was funny just trying to follow this story because i m reading uh bbc trying to get to the bottom you know what s going on and they have they ve reports of you know northern ireland may follow and whales may follow i m like wait a minute what like it reminded me of ted lasso there s a part where he goes how many countries are in this country i m like what s going on here so um i m still confused as to what the united kingdom in england is and it s been explained to me a hundred times but um i ll put that aside because he s the uk prime minister so i don t know but i ll put that aside and admit to one embarrassing fact which is my in reaction to this just trying to marshal evidence for my pre existing biases i was looking up hospital bed capacity in the uk versus the united states just getting ready to be like well the difference is they have a better hospital bed capacity but which is not true turns out us and uk have about the same hospital capacity and about the same amount of physicians and nurses and things like that so uh less guns over there though so i don t have as much to marshal from this other than to say i i stand by to see how this goes yeah so there s england there s wales and there s scotland now but um northern ireland yeah and there s northern ireland and yeah it s all one thing but it s all different too at the same time but um i think this could be a model for for united states as well as just other countries to figure out a way to still take covet 19 serious but also get back to normal because we just can t i mean this is like the third year of this now like we just can t keep you know but but like we ve talked about it before there is this like pandemic class that enjoys these restrictions like people who are people somebody calls the pajama class yeah they love the work from home they love to stay away from crowds they love to wear the mask they ve just created into a whole political identity so i felt like it would be more difficult here in the united states for us to do stuff like england and i feel like there would be like a left wing political pushback to it well ricky i had a question for you on this because part of that what was surprising to me is you know it s a different type of system it s parliamentary system so it s not federalists like us so when the government says it essentially happens across the country and what he was rolling back is such an interesting combination of policies because a lot of them will seem familiar to us but one of them stood out to me which was this work from home guidance which essentially it seems to me like england had been under a an advisory to work from home and i guess people followed that there like essentially people even more than in the united states weren t going into the office like here at las vegas everybody s here we re all in person i don t even know what the guidance is from the cdc is anymore on whether you should go to the office but i know a lot of people are aren t following that yeah i mean one of the things that johnson said was one of the reasons that they were rolling it back was because people complied so much which i mean i think some of those restrictions were probably a bit unreasonable but um yeah i mean it s a different situation here because we re a little bit behind in terms of omicron england and especially london peaked before us and we also have a much bigger country so different waves are happening in different places and i think you know there s still little pockets where delta is still kind of at play but um yeah i mean we definitely have a different system and if we want to roll back mandates that does have to happen on a more local level but this is a great model and this follows spain and even australia now is kind of saying we re going to live with this in an endemic way and i think that we d all probably benefit in doing that and then saying okay here s our very specific at risk demographics and population that we need to continue to make sure that there s a space for them in society to live healthy and safe lives and everyone else can kind of continue which i m i m all here for when am i going to be able to go to a bar in new york without having to show my vax car that s what i want i think it s hard to say and that s why i think people need to learn from this kind of stuff like you know joking aside about the kind of evidence i wanted marshall i do think that there is a problem in this country of learning from available evidence right like sweden for example like there was this this massive rejection of sweden as an idea early on in this pandemic when they were more permissive and were less restrictive than other countries and because people on the left saw people on the right using sweden as evidence of uh of a different better kind of covert policy people immediately rejected it because they rejected the people sharing the anecdote but i think if you look back on it uh at least from what i ve seen sweden is a really interesting case study because the economist was ranking how different countries have fared during the pandemic and sweden did pretty well and so if that s true and if the uk or england in coming out of these restrictions fares better than other more restrictive places we need to learn from that and um there s so it s a controlled experiment right now you can compare it to places like hong kong for example which is going in the opposite direction where they canceled classes for secondary school and but i worry about our ability to do this like i was doing an interview yesterday in different contexts where this pollster this democratic pollster was making one claim after another that to me didn t seem accurate like we were talking about um like we still need to keep people home and school closures worked and all this and then i went to go look up the data after the interview it s hard to fact check people in real time i looked at the data and there s very little evidence that uh sustained school closures actually helped prevent human community spread over time yeah absolutely yeah well hopefully we can get back to some sense of uh normalcy here in new york city but i think that is going to be the end of our

debate a show for political eclectics i m robbie gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlot well corey where are we going to start today we got a big show today we re going to be talking about a lot of interesting things coming up supreme court justice stephen breyer is stepping down leaving biden to choose his replacement so far there s a short list and a campaign promise from biden to nominate a black woman we discussed the implications of all of that after a record setting year the stock market is flirting with a correction ravi takes us through what to watch and this is not financial advice should we all panic sale libel laws are under the microscope because of an unlikely duo between sarah palin and cardi b we ll take you through the significance of those cases and the old adage everything that s old is new again we explore the emerging trend that old music is more popular on streaming platforms than newer music but first things first joe rogan had psychologist and author jordan peterson on his podcast for a four hour very long conversation this week they touched on topics ranging from race to climate change and while you may not have thought of jordan peterson as an expert in those areas because well he s not he sure had a lot to say about them on climate in particular peterson has provoked backlash for questioning the validity of climate change let s check out this clip climate change one is a weird one so that one that s because there s no such thing as climate right climate and everything are the same word and i that s what bothers me about the climate change types it s like this is something that bothers me about it technically it s like climate is about everything it s okay but your models aren t based on everything your models are based on a set number of variables yeah so that means you ve reduced the variables which are everything to that set well how did you decide which set of variables to include in the equation if it s about everything and that s not just a criticism that s like if it s about everything your models aren t right because your models do not and cannot model everything i m confused uh what i know i know both you ravi and ricky you both watched this entire interview i got through a little bit of it um what is the takeaway here what does he mean by climbing is everything yeah i think this reminds me a lot of people when i was running schools there were these people who were proponents of this idea of the whole child approach to education and they would say you know we can t be measuring and testing reading or writing or math because it s the whole child and you can t isolate any one variable and what i would say to them is what i would say to peterson which is like if you go to the doctor and your doctor says that you have high ldl uh or you know your bmi is increasing dramatically that doesn t tell you everything about your life and and your health but it certainly should be alarming right and that s how i think about climate change the fact that we re dramatically increasing co2 into the atmosphere and the earth is warming and that if it continues to warm at the rate that it that it is we re in for some very reliably catastrophic scenarios uh is important and i think this is just like sophistry to say all right well because you can t include every possible variable doesn t mean that the variables that you are paying attention to uh aren t really important absolutely what do w what do we think about here when he says the models for climate change aren t accurate because they don t include enough variables well he s wrong about that so zeke house father which is quite a name from the university of cal berkeley looked at 17 of the most sophisticated and most used models for climate that were developed between 1970 and 2007 and found that 10 depending on your account 10 to 14 of those models were accurate meaning and predicting the future meaning most of them were accurate and predicting the future but the whole point is we know the characteristics of co2 we know the kind of impact it has on a warming climate we know that we re increasing it and so even if there are other things that could happen like you know are there things that could happen to mitigate climate change that we can t predict today sure just like i could step out tomorrow and get hit by a car that doesn t mean i shouldn t take my ldl serious uh today so uh this is what i m saying is like he s he s basically saying we can t take seriously anything unless we can evaluate all things all the time and then i would wonder like then are we just like relativists like we just walk around and care about nothing at this point yeah this as a peterson fan this interview kind of made me cringe a little bit because now like i was ready to come in and defend him but like i think that s something that we do here well is like full disclosure next segments about the stock market and i don t really know what s going on and like i m gonna admit that and i feel like there s this this feeling that everybody in the media needs to know everything about every single issue and this conversation just happened because rogan brought up that he was reading a book about climate change and then it just went off into this long rant from from peterson he couldn t help himself i think that you know there s a lot of things that i think that peterson s really compelling on like like issues of personality a personal responsibility um his biblical series he s i think he s an agnostic and i ve found as somebody who s kind of identifies as a deist like he s made me way more christian than going to church has somehow which is he s got a really interesting like i m not preaching to you kind of vantage point and there s a lot of really compelling stuff in my opinion that peterson does this is not it and i wish that people could just be like i don t really know that much about this thing right and i think that s that s a great trait because that s why we don t have faith in media figures and you know i don t want to hear about what peterson has to say about climate or the carnivore diet like i don t i m okay well i agree with you i like there are certain parts of peterson s you know what made him famous in the first place in his his book that just kind of pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind of preaching to young men in particular i think there s a lot of good there and it s amazing because i think you could immediately see in this interview that he s high in his own supply he gets in there and he s like he cannot let the pitch go by of rogan saying he was reading a book on climate change and has to make the whole beginning of the interview about that and i think you know rogan s in the news right now because there s you know a lot of scrutiny of of how whether he s promoting misinformation or disinformation on his show i would say that he acquits himself quite well in this not just because i m somebody using climate change but because i m not sure and rogan says he basically says he s not sure where he comes out yet but i think he did a really good job in this interview of asking simple questions of peterson repeatedly to justify certain claims he was making and at times they would look certain things up that peterson was describing and i think in many ways it it shows either an evolution of rogan i m not as much of a connoisseur of rogan but like either an evolution in his approach or you know maybe that he s he s better at you know fact checking than people give him credit for but there was another part of this interview that i want to highlight which is uh the peterson goes on to say that uh liberals and people who believe in climate change want to you know our main solution is to lower economic development especially for the less well off and and peterson says that the solution of climate change is actually economic development and to make the poor richer the fastest way to make the planet sustainably green and ecologically viable is to make poor people as rich as possible as fast as we possibly can and so there s sort of two main claims here one is that the main solution to climate change being pushed is to actually harm economic development and so we should examine that and then the second is this idea that the solution is to make poor people richer and i looked at both of these i think there s definitely some truth to some people who are you know who are learned about climate change who want to do things like tax carbon and make energy uh more expensive but i don t think that that s the majority of people and in part i want to read you know bill gates probably the biggest investor in the climate change world and certainly on the philanthropic side this is from his book he said um his book that uh how to avoid a climate disaster he goes i kept thinking about what i d witness in my travels india for example has a population of 1 4 billion people many of them among the poorest in the world and i didn t think it was fair for anyone to tell indians that their children couldn t have lights to study by or that thousands of indians should die in heatwaves because installing air conditioners is bad for the environment the only solution i could imagine was to make clean energy so cheap that every country would choose it over fossil fuels so i think gates is is i think reflective of most people who care about this issue it just say we don t want to make energy more expensive for indians we want to actually invest in r d uh and deployment of technology to make it cheaper uh for them so that the trade off makes sense uh so that s where i m coming from on this is like i think he presents a false choice in this interview so i think what i m gathering from this is that jordan peters is not really an expert on the climate yeah ricky as somebody who is familiar with a lot of jordan peterson s work i m someone who s not that familiar with his work what about him has this appeal that the fact that we re even talking about this interview this was supposed to be a big deal so what is it about that appeal that even allows him to be able to have a four hour interview with joe rogan yeah um i think that he is definitely a thought leader in a way that um you know i hear all the time that young men are empowered by him i found him empowering i never heard any message of his that i felt was particularly directed towards men but i think that he brings this message especially to younger people that are like my generation s very nihilistic and that s just obvious it s in our music and our culture and how that we think about the world and having somebody who kind of teaches you to take personal personal initiative to kind of pull yourself up by the bootstraps to make a difference in your life and find meaning through just kind of in like kind of more traditional ways how it used to be while everyone else is kind of nihilistic i mean that s just i think that s kind of the common thread of it and even just his older work i think on youtube that s that s really where where a lot of his inspiring stuff is maybe not everyone will find it that way but um i think there s definitely some stuff that s worth checking out of his and um i just i think he he teaches a a way to find meaning in a way that a lot of people aren t able to today yeah i would encourage people who i get the question often from left leaning people who are like explain to me this jordan peterson phenomenon and i think reading his book i think is like his book and some of those early youtube videos because i think uh correctly from wrong he came to prominence because he was doing uh videos online challenging candidates hate speech laws there s actually a really interesting documentary about his rise and it shows basically how he was challenging these laws in in canada about i think things like gender pronouns and how you refer to people and all that and he kind of expanded it out and i think even if you re not with him on the underlying issue um the kinds of battles he was having in canada explain a lot about why i think he appeals more to the right and the left and i think it s a shame in in many ways because his book is not necessarily a right wing book like you read that book and it it really is like a self help book yeah and i think that even if i disagree with maybe half of the stuff in there the other half that that i think is valuable is really unique and and i think speaks to why the book is so popular definitely and i think as bill s c16 stuff from canada sometimes ends up giving it more of a right wing reputation just because it does deal with gender but i think it s important to remember that his argument about it was about compelled speech and not whether or not he would respect someone s pronouns just by choice and so i think that because it fell on that fault line of a really delicate social issue he automatically kind of became a figurehead of the right whereas i think that argument is really just a free speech argument in the end but then again he does have other right wing values yeah he you know as much it makes it hard for me to advocate for him with left leaning audiences where he does stuff in this interview which is repeatedly come back to this is the problem the left this is the problem on the left yeah and it s you know our whole operation here is about trying to critique the left the right to center anybody and i find him routinely doing things that we try to avoid here which is create the most uncharitable version of the other side and knock it down which is what he did here on climate change like he did no work whatsoever to say well actually there are a lot of people who uh you know are advocating for solutions to climate change that don t make the poor worse off and so i only want to critique a small part of them he could have easily said that but he didn t yeah i think part of that also comes there s a pattern of people from academia who become thought leaders in like the kind of right wing where they are in these academic circles where the most political extreme stuff can thrive because it s not really real world applications and so even coming from a university a few months ago like there s some crazy stuff and if i spend enough time there i might be kind of caricaturing the left in my mind in the way that i think that sometimes he tends to so i feel like there s an interesting kind of common thread of the people who do that often come from academia right right i think it s just one of those examples of kind of like staying in your league when it comes to expressing your thoughts about certain subjects i think if peterson had stayed into the realm of what he knows more about this probably would have been a moral i think we should add that to the rules for life then maybe that ll be what is it 12 rules for life so we ll make that the 13th yeah stay in your league guys all right so the supreme court s oldest liberal justice stephen breyer is stepping down at the age of 83 his retirement opens the way for president biden to nominate a liberal justice while democrats still control the senate now biden s nominee won t change the political makeup of the court which will still have six conservative justices and three liberals but it will change the bench s makeup in one significant way because brighton during the campaign promised he would nominate a black woman so let s just start with that uh is it ever a good idea to if whether it s you know supreme court or vice president pick is it ever a good idea for somebody to say you know i m going to nominate this person they have to be this gender they have to be this race is that ever a good way to start the conversation i think this is the challenge of this country really because there have been 115 justices who ve served on the supreme court all but seven have been white men so uh that s obviously alarming and it s not accidental at the same time i think announcing ahead of time that this is your litmus test undermines whoever you re gonna pick because then it makes it seem like that was the qualification not how smart you are how great of a jurist you are and so i know this seems like i m kind of hedging here i understand why people were demanding of biden such a promise because there s frustration out there with the fact that there hasn t been great representation but at the same time if he could have gotten away with not making that promise i think everybody would be better off including whoever he picks because it just it delegitimizes that person before they even enter the seat 100 i think um you know as a woman all the time i feel like there s these women in journalism events and awards for women specifically and like i i appreciate that in a sense but at the same time i want to be recognized for me and i think that s um i agree with you that that there s a necessity to have people that fit those demographics ultimately coming to the court and even if he did pick that behind the scenes i i wouldn t really have an issue with it but i think the optics of announcing that and promising it you always end up undermining people when when you pick them or you say you re going to pick them for an immutable characteristic then that ends up kind of holding the weight and giving fuel to the people that oppose them in my opinion yeah what i will say here is that there is a precedent for this um ronald reagan in 1980 when he was running for president he vowed that he was going to put a woman on the supreme court and he did george h w bush the supreme court justice thurgood marshall died when george w bush was president and he felt compelled to replace a black justice with another black justice so that s how we got stuck with clarence thomas um and so it was ideologically very different from marshall but but fit the graph and that s actually a good point the fact that george w bush put another black man on the court but he was so ideologically different from the one he replaced that it seems to me that ideology would be the more important characteristic that a president would look for rather than just blank and blanketly saying oh it has to be a person that fits this demographic right and i think this this relates to the problem kamala harris is having because obviously there s a lot of speculation that i think wrong speculation i think it s stupid that that biden would nominate her that she would she wouldn t serve i think if she was nominated but that wouldn t make any sense because if it s a 50 50 tie in the senate then who would break the tie yeah no you would replace her but i think like the but i do think that her challenges in many ways come back to the promised by made there which is i think people look at her and don t see somebody who is picked for her qualifications but because of her identity whether it s right or wrong we ve we ve spoken on this issue before i m not gonna i don t feel like we need to go back into it but i do think like the american public looks at her and says this is not somebody who was chosen for any other reason than her identity that she was the best person of this narrow group of people that we could have picked and i think that s the challenge that she faces i think there s gonna be a challenge that the next supreme court justice faced now in the end the supreme court justices who sit for life so i think really in the end it s not as consequential because their main audience is the other eight justices so i wouldn t say it s anywhere near the the size of the issue that um that harris faces yeah but i think the politics of this are interesting because you ve got uh two names that are consistently coming up one is uh katanji brown jackson who s on the dc circuit i think that s the most likely name to make it through here because she made it uh out of confirmation just recently to get that seat in the dc circuit and she got three republican votes she got lisa murkowski susan collins and lindsey graham so there s lizzy graham yeah and so there s some sense that she already has been tested through the senate now obviously this is a higher seat so there could be a whole different debate and i wouldn t count on anybody in the us senate to be consistent yeah not these days um and like they you could you could see them making an argument like different tests for the supreme court but i think she s gonna be the most likely i think she would make it through but correct me if i m wrong you used to have to have 60 votes to support somebody else s supreme yeah they changed mcconnell changed the filibuster but carmel changed it so it s kind of a backfire onto mcconnell here because he could have had more control the republicans could have had more control over this pick he ll come out ahead trust me on this one he always takes that away doesn t he he may even block this too so get the best of both worlds oh he ll absolutely figure out a way i m absolutely and you know we were doing some research about like the qualifications to be on the supreme court and there really are none i mean you ve got to be confirmed by the senate but you don t have to even go on the law school yeah on the supreme court and there s no age requirements either because there s an age requirement on the presidency requirement to go in the center of the house there s no age requirements on the supreme court so i say let s get a teenager on something a lot of the trump confirmations like i m not blaming this on any one party but i think each each administration gets a little bit more brazen and he was he was nominating people that are super young on to the circuits and district courts and you know these people will be with us forever for a long time yeah absolutely well we ll see who he ends up nominating um it s been a year since robin hood reddit and gamestop came together to shake up the stock market this time last year retail investors were pouring money into meme stocks like game stock and amc sending share prices well past any rational level to the moon as the reddit crowd likes to say fast forward to now and the u s markets are in a correction territory with the fed widely expected to raise interest rates stocks have surged pretty much non stop since the first months of the pandemic driving a lot of valuations to absurdly high levels but now a lot of people are looking around and asking is the party over ravi um take me through this like what should i be doing right now yeah well okay this is not investment advice to any of you or to any of our listeners but i think we should start with jeremy grantham who is uh the founder of gmo which is a firm out of boston and grantham i want to start with grantham because he has been really credible on the question of bubbles and he s a proponent of what this theory of like reversion to the mean meaning that there are certain trends in american society uh economically and the market always reverts back to the mean and he s been tested so this guy uh avoided the japan disaster in 89 he voted the dot com bubble he seriously mitigated his downside in the housing bubble so he s been right a lot now he s been talking for years uh about the fact that uh we re headed for an iceberg in our current climate uh and he did an interview a couple days ago to describe this let s look at a couple clips from that interview super bubbles can really wipe you out like 1929 did so we re talking about a decline of certainly from the peak of almost 50 percent and of course it declined very quickly 50 in 1929 it declined 50 in three years in 2000 and the housing market which was another great american super bubble went all the way back to trend uh in three years so basically what he s saying he s calling this a super bubble and he says there were only three other super bubbles in the past 100 years 1929 2000 in japan and 89 and this is the first time ever he claims that we have simultaneous bubbles across all asset classes uh or and you know i m i m going to walk you through a little bit of this so housing uh houses in the us are at the highest multiple of family income ever including leading up to the housing crisis uh and he this is not just a u s problem there s it s actually more pronounced in countries around the world so this could be a global problem canada australia uk china all have actually worse problems here wow uh equities and stocks so there s this thing called the shiller price earnings ratio essentially saying like how is your stock trading relative to how much uh revenue you re bringing in how much earnings you re bringing in over like a 10 year average and those ratios are typically somewhere between 17 and 20 and in december they touched 39 so basically double what they have been historically and if you look into the details there s so many absurd examples in the equities market like rivian is a good example this car company yeah um was trading um at a higher rate uh it had a higher market valuation than ford uh even though rivien had not sold a single car at that point and ford was selling something like 1 8 million cars uh and so there s all this crazy absurd behavior and then there s the bond market which we saw the period of the highest price bonds ever which means the lowest yields which means that it is more um like you getting anything out of your savings is harder than ever which means that everybody s forced into the market to play this game and actually putting money into savings you lose money in real terms so everybody s being forced out into this uh and which means drives up all the prices of the equities so it s kind of a circular problem and then you have commodities where you have oil and important metals all trending above the average the un uh global index for food prices is at an all time high or around an all time high so you put those four categories together and grantham is saying this is a perfect storm and this is worse than anything we ve ever seen in our lifetime we ve never seen all these forces come together and when we think about the dot com bubble is mainly an equities problem we think about the the housing bubble it was mainly a housing issue right it was japan where there were two separate things happening at once where there was the real estate market and equities at the same time but you didn t see all this other stuff like the commodities and the bonds etc and he says um and this is where i ll kick it to you guys to think about what this means he says we face the greatest potential markdown of wealth in u s history if valuations across all these asset classes return even to two thirds of the way back to historical norms total wealth losses will be on the order of 35 trillion dollars felt like i m on cnbc right now so what s driving this this over evaluation of all these stocks yeah i i think like for him there are multiple explanations and i think one thing that i would caution our listeners to do is avoid the one uh simple explanation right and that s why i like grantham is like he is bringing together a lot of different explanations to say that when you have this super bubble and you have multiple asset classes all having similar problems but there there isn t just one explanation for it right i think a lot of attention is being paid to the fed and they deserve a lot of the blame and this has been going on for a long time greenspan juiced the uh equities market leading up to the dot com bubble even though he said it was a irrational exuberance he played a huge part in that and then sowed the seeds for the housing bubble by basically going after the head of the cftc at the time who wanted to police the derivatives market which was the ticking time bomb that got us into housing bubble bernanke when he was at the fed uh famously underplayed the housing bubble basically said there wasn t a housing bubble and said that in our history of our country we ve never seen housing prices go down well surprised they did go down right after that um and you ve been seeing similar problems where the fed and some of these aren t like and this is where like i m not saying that that these are just evil people i just think they have a bad theory about how to manage the economy so you know over the past you know whether it s powell uh and um uh what you know whether it s power or even like uh you know yelling at the treasury and when she was at the fed uh they have this theory that we need to pump as much money into the economy as possible and they have not they have no sense about the unintended consequences of what that means and basically what s happened is interest rates have mainta have stayed low uh basically they re at record lows uh which everybody thinks of as a good thing because people could buy houses and all that kind of stuff but that also means that if you re the the kind of person who s conservative you just want to put money in a savings account you re losing money over time which means that everything gets more expensive because it makes no sense to keep money in savings uh and then at the same time uh through this this policy of quantitative easing they re pumping money into the private sector money is cheap for corporations which drives these valuations right like one of the reasons why a lot of these companies don t go out of business uh or they re the the price of the stock isn t reflective of their actual unit economics is because the fed is making it so easy to just pull money out uh and so what you re going to see now as rates go up as quantitative easing uh gets pulled back which the fed is signaled they re likely to be heading towards then you re going to see prices of equities go down you re going to see potentially inflation go down and all this and once you see the drop in all these assets you re going to see wealth disintegrate in this country and that is going to be frightening well i ve already kind of surrendered my credibility on this person in the beginning of the podcast but yeah i mean i have to say from during the pandemic during lockdown i was living with my mom in la she was a former financial advisor and so she trades stocks now kind of full time and i remember sitting through the pandemic and thinking like okay like everyone s losing their jobs like small businesses are crippled and what the heck is happening in the stock market like she d be like oh i had a great day today and i m like none of this makes sense and so and just intuitive intuitively to me the whole time like it just has felt completely off with what our culture and what like the real economic ground level experiences for everyday americans has just not been reflected in the stock market which to me just just felt wrong the entire time and i think in part that s probably because of the way that the interest rates have gone down and how you know rich people have more money to just kind of play with in the stock market and yeah i m i m a little concerned well he makes it he makes a scary prediction which essentially he says that the speculative stocks fall first but he says it starts with the speculative stocks and then it moves to the blue chip stocks and so that the question then becomes and this is where we truly become cnbc is where do you put your money yeah is a big question and i think here s my sense and i m talking i ll talk about what i would i how i m thinking about this um not not this is not advice uh is uh there are two different theories uh of of where you should go from here there s one theory which is all right the s p 500 every uh every 11 months goes down about 10 on average right historically so maybe you know there are the pelotons and these other companies are losing 50 plus percent of their valuations but their most other stocks are somewhere in that 10 range you know and who knows by the end of this stocks could be up or down it s such a volatile market right now uh so there s a theory that says not much different is happening and at that point uh just invest in those blue chip stocks because this is not going to reach them so look at the companies that actually have earnings have good union economics like an apple or something right like a company and you know apple has you know 190 billion dollars of cash on its books so that s a company that s probably going to weather the storm yeah that s one group of people that advocate for that i m sympathetic to that and i don t know enough to say whether that s wrong or not grantham goes further and says get out of us equities all together he has a few theories you could watch this interview uh about where you can go from here uh and he i think he s basically advising for people to keep an eye on the bond market and your savings accounts and see if the high yield savings accounts come back to the point where you can move money into something that s going to predictively give you a few percentage points either match or outpace inflation and that would be like a conservative approach to this i don t really know the answer that but i would not be investing in speculative stocks right now you could get lucky you could catch peloton or zoom on on the on the bounce but if you can t afford to lose that money then you shouldn t be playing in the market in that way i blame tick tock to be totally honest with you because of gamestop yeah handstop stuff i felt like that had a lot to do with like over evaluating uh companies and things like that and it kind of goes back to i mean this is all sounding real 1929 ish to me yeah and it goes back to i think it s a quote that s attributed to joseph kennedy jfk s father who said something to the effect of when the shoeshine boys are giving you stock tips it s time to take your money out of the market well that s my thing right now i i personally feel like you know when the tick tock boys and the redditors are giving you stock tips it s time to take your money out of the market well let me let me get to one piece on that before we move on which is uh i was looking into this and i thought to myself hey is the retail investing driving part of this but interestingly 50 56 of american adults own stock right now which is about the same that it s been for the past 20 years so even though that some of these new tools like robin hood have changed maybe the way people interact with the market uh the average american is not any more exposed it seems to the market than they were before and i think in in large part like these new tools are democratizing in many ways like it s good for me that robin hood doesn t charge fees now yeah what they do with your data and all that is a whole separate question that we should be challenging uh and i think that you know there s all this brouhaha over the gamestop stuff and i think there was like a you know the elites that were getting challenged because they were saying all right uh don t you know you re able to invest whichever way you want you could invest in sophisticated options or whatever but the minute the average person does that you get mad at them uh and then they re but then the elites were saying look i m just saying i don t want you to lose your life savings in in a stock that has no uh you know historic earnings and like a lot of these are industries that are that are on the downwards in fact like a movie theater chain you know like these are things that that there s not a strong story as to why it should be you know 100 times its value from one week to the next and i think in the end you re a libertarian i i imagine this is your case like let people make their mistakes is how people learn like if people go in there and lose money on like we can t like we can t be so paternalistic as to say i m gonna tie your hands for you people need to go in lose some money learn from it and then maybe make wiser investment decisions into the future yeah for sure i mean i think also with the um with the gamestop thing a lot of the tactics that were used are kind of similar to what hedge funds have done historically and there was a lot of freaking out as soon as the little guy did it and coordinated and you know i i realized that kind of shakes things up but at the same time you know i think as many people who are being informed in going into the market the better because especially with lockdown and stuff like if if you re getting stimulus checks that you want to put into something that you re speculating like i don t i don t know i don t see i don t see any issue with it as long as you re doing it responsibly and realizing that there is a risk and not just going off of reddit in time yeah and i would go even further and say you have a right to do it irresponsibly you know just don t come crying to anybody but yeah totally you know if you want to and this is the true of doge like there s some things that became jokes that people made a lot of money people lost a lot of money and in the end people need to assume that risk this is my action park libertarianism yeah well i gotta call my broker um so cardi b and sarah palin two rappers you may not have associated with each other and i wouldn t recommend watching the former alaska governor wrap baby got back on fox s show the match singer applause um so yeah we just watched um the former governor of alaska as well as the former vice presidential nominee from 2008 sarah palin rap baby got back had some bars there although polar opposites both of these public figures have been in the courts recently fighting libel laws this past week rapper cardi b was awarded four million dollars after suing popular youtube gossip blocker tasha k for defamation invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress tasha k admitted to spreading lies about uh cardi b saying things like she was a prostitute and used cocaine and had herpes some crazy stuff with beer bottles whereas cardi successfully won her suit palin has been fighting the new york times in court for four and a half years the media giant admitted one of its editorials and accurately linked the former vice presidential candidate to a 2011 shooting in tucson arizona which severely injured congresswoman gabby giffords as public figures palin will have to prove as cardi successfully did in her case that the times acted with genuine malice but will palin be able to prove it and are libel laws set out of the new york times versus sullivan too protective to the media uh this is a really crazy case because it s really hard to win a libel case and somehow uh cardi b did it yeah yeah i think like i think for people listening at home it s confusing because there are two different standards if you re a famous person or if you re a regular person it s very different if you re just a regular person you have to just show that somebody was negligent like meaning like like they didn t whether they intended to or not if they said something false about you that they could have reasonably avoided saying um with some effort uh then they could be held liable that whereas if you re a famous person there s a standard from new york times sullivan that says you have to show actual malice and the test there is essentially um was there some kind of intent uh or like serious subjective doubt uh about the facts that you had but you still moved ahead anyway and that s why the new york times finds itself where it is because if in this case of sarah palin these cases almost never make it to court and even though a lot of legal experts think she s gonna fail uh ultimately in the in the verdict um the reason why the new york times is even here in the first place is because there s a record of a new york times reporter uh drafting a story there was this map at issue with gun sights over it that palin put out and arizona was one of the states and and eventually gabby giffords got shot and there was this question of like did palin incite that or not but uh the original draft of this article there was no uh you know evidence of a direct link between that map and uh giffords getting shot uh and also uh there were just miscalculations of the way that the map looked and all that and then the editor came in and basically edited it to say the exact opposite and that is the paper trail that i think gets us to where we are today so whether or not the new york times loses they don t look great because it seems like they really really wanted to believe this about palin and printed it behind the scenes i think in a lot of newsrooms editors always want to ham it up and make it more sensational and this is a really good example of how much that can go awry especially putting a politician on the line for a shooting that they had nothing to do with um so i do respect that palin was definitely defamed by this but i think cardi had it so lobbed up to her in court with um with the defendant going on the stand and admitting that she knew that they were false and making videos from a couple years ago saying like oh i know this isn t true but quote i want the money like that s that s pretty bad and i also don t want to know what happened with those beer bottles supposedly laughter they need to know that yeah but that s the key what you re saying is the key like these cases are so hard to win with a famous person that you have to basically show like they have to say it out loud because that s how hard these cases are and what is like parody plays a big part in this too because i know like with a lot of excuse me i know like with a lot of celebrities if you use like parody law you can just get away with saying anything like the national choir and things like that yeah and parody and opinion right so you could say i believe that uh sarah palin incited violence uh and you know as long as you couch in those terms you re pretty much protected but i think that when you state it as a fact that s where you get yourself into trouble and so you know a lot of people are pushing for reforms these laws but the us is actually unique in having laws like this and gorsuch and thomas there s a lot of movement from the right to actually water down some of these standards which is i think the other significance of the palin case is that she s already signaled that she would appeal if she made it if they ruled against her which they likely will and it s possible this could make its way back up to the supreme court where they reevaluate new york times versus sullivan i doubt they ll have the votes yet we don t know what coney barrett s going to say but it s hard to imagine that they have the rest of the court they can get to five on this yeah to change the standard uh but i think it will be significant if it gets up there because it might make it closer and closer to a change in this law i don t love the concept of weakening the the protections that people have with us i think that especially as someone who comes from a newsroom and all the all the people that are whistleblowers and you want to you want to publish something on on rumor and expressly say that like i think that there could be damage done to journalism and people coming forward and actually exposing something or or nerves that are coming out of the newsroom that don t need to be there whereas i think having the the ex when i mean i think it s totally appropriate that if a newsroom purposefully is saying something false that s that s a different thing from from reporting something and i think that there s there s definitely could be a chilling effect of rolling that back but at the same time even with the cardi b situation i think now like a lot of youtubers and bloggers are going to be more careful when they know that something s not true and that s not necessarily a bad thing either yeah so i think i think like promoting caution is great but stifling the conversation is where i think some of these laws could end up going if they end up being amended and so i hope that we are as conservative as possible and tweaking them yeah absolutely did cardi b really need four million extra dollars from a youtuber i m not really sure i mean i definitely think that the youtuber was very malicious in what she did and it was not right at all but it reminds me a little bit about what teeter peter thiel did when he backed hulk hogan right against i think it was gawker oh yeah yeah yeah he didn t need the money it was more about the statement it was the page to say you know he i think he wanted to create a chilling effect uh for anybody in the future who came after and there s a little bit of vengeance in it too yeah i think whether she needs that money or not i think this was this is a cold move yeah it s pretty cool she s used to that but um yeah so we re talking about carter let s talk about music a little bit more here a trend in the music industry old music is out streaming new music like never before according to an article in the atlantic old songs now represent 70 of the us music market even worse the new music market is actually shrinking the 200 most popular new tracks now regularly account for less than five percent of total streams that rate was twice as high just three years ago so um this is really interesting now it is important to make the distinction that when this article talks about new music they re talking about music that s released in the last 18 months so literally anything outside of that window is considered old so this could be people just listening to songs for like three years ago four years ago but a lot of data suggests that a lot of young people and these people in general are listening to music you know from decades ago so what do we think about this trend well i m going to be the old man here and say that music today sucks uh that s that s what s driving that yeah i have no idea who s popular right now i don t know what s happening and i m just supposed to be a youngin i m not sure either olivia rodrigo yeah that s all i know um but but yeah so i i wanted to bring this up because i wanted to ask this question because i wanted to apply this to us is or do we fit this characteristic what was the last three songs you listened to for me oh you know this is embarrassing uh i i just went down a mariah carey thing as well i did not expect that yeah i was just i went back to her i don t know where she came up but i was just went through her back catalog uh i think it was like because of all the weird research i do for this show i have like a my youtube algorithm is also sounds like an excuse to me yeah it dished up a mariah carey tour of her house uh and so i was like oh mariah carey i haven t thought about her in a while and so then i went down the the rabbit hole of mariah carey so we re talking like earlier the odp i think it was the od i started with the odb i think it was fantasy yeah fantasy because i m from staten island so i like that but it s like and then it s kind of a gateway drug so i do the odb one i think there s one with jay z and then i m and then i m like full on in like ballad mode at a certain point like hero and all these other songs so yeah that s my yeah oh i fit this trend though that was like that was that s that s from the 90s that s from this older music what about you ricky i think i ve hit the trend as well but like in a more modern old music sense i ve i think during the pandemic for me especially with everything being kind of so out of control i ve enjoyed listening to music from my childhood like i don t know if it s a nostalgia thing for other people but i think there s something kind of comforting about it so i ve got some like early 2000s pops that i m embarrassingly still listening oh um last three songs i listened to was probably my life from billy joel and then i listened to this charming man by the smiths and then i listened to throw some d s by rich boy featuring polo to don so that was the last reason you know it s funny when i was over the winter break i i redownloaded billy joel s greatest hits oh yeah absolutely incredible no one s really making music like that anymore maybe that s what s driving this like there s just like maybe maybe music does kind of kind of suck these days yeah except for nostalgia some good old nostalgia i think did you just say country is really good right now yeah like who are you listening to in the country world i mean zach brown you know i saw their concert over the summer they had a new album that came out was pretty good uh i think that country to me it has like over the past like 10 to 20 years has like gotten better whereas almost every other kind of music has gotten worse really so you think about like jason isabel zack brown band um you know kenny chesney even like there s uh like i think like country is is getting less twangy and poppy and more sort of folky um so if you don t like country maybe it s time to get into it that s just nashville self coming out yeah i used to before i moved to nashville i used to say i like all music except for country music and then when i left nashville country s up there for me it s right there wow that s awesome well
