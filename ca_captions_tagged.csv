welcome again to another episode of sac town talks today we have senator sidney come lager joining us on a what s happening wednesday sydney how s it going it s going well yeah thank you so much for having me um it s really windy out there so i m excited that i m inside talking to you yeah today uh another successful groundhog day the groundhog sized shadow for six more weeks of winter kind of how are you taking the news and and what are your thoughts well i don t mind layering i am a chicago girl at heart so i don t mind if it s uh windy and a little chilly and but i will say now that we re in the swing space having to you know layer up to cross the street to go over to the capitol and then come back and then go back we re gonna see how many assembly members and senators make it uh through february and march that s funny you know there s been all these talks about you know redistricting and they re calling the great resignation members are moving everywhere running differently do you attribute contribute the swing space walk to uh some of their decisions here oh my god yes i think people were like i m so upset that i don t have any more parquet in my office that i am retiring today oh yeah that s amazing jokes jokes jokes jokes but i do think it s it s um i do think for folks there s been a shift in the kind of work um in the joy that comes from it and um i do think that that s played a large role in people s decisions to retire or to not seek re election you know having a year and a half to be closer to home i do think resets people s priorities yeah you know you have an interesting background you know my producer really wants me to ask you about this uh before you got into politics can you kind of tell us kind of what what you were doing oh my goodness um i was a wild child before i got into politics i m a girl from chicago i spent my um you know i got my first taste of politics by helping my grandmother get harold washington elected as the first black mayor of chicago which is really important for folks from chicago i came out here to go um to usc i was here during the earthquake and the riots both really pivotal um moments for me and experiences as a result of the earthquake i went to graduate school back on the east coast because i do not like shaky earth but because of the riots and the um sort of relationships that i built and the interest that was peaked in my heart about the city i came back and i ve been in la ever since i ve worked in the nonprofit world i ve worked in the arts world i ve worked in the entertainment industry i eventually ended up at crystal stairs where that s where i met holly mitchell and then we kind of went on the road you know working to help families find and pay for child care and then getting her in the assembly in the senate so i have had a very interesting journey that has married activism and the arts and politics and i have to say i find great joy um in each of those things yeah i guess kind of during your your arts period you were an assistant to delroy lindo can you kind of tell us about that experience yes so you know delroy is uh you know crooklyn and gets shorty and ransom and he was in the five bloods and uh this new one with um regina king and ill just elba uh with the it was the western so um i family friend known him for a really long time i was his uh assistant and i ran his production company uh sia luna development uh we produced a number of you know one hour interviews with uh folks like joan chen the really um acclaimed director and um charles burnett and um spike lee and you know delroy is family to me i think he is beautiful and amazing and brilliant and funny um and he s in california with his family so he checks in on me from time to time but it was a great experience i mean that s where i learned kind of you know behind the scenes about the movie industry that s where i came to learn a lot about you know the trades and what goes into it and the hours that people work and uh then you get to meet you know celebrities and you realize that they are real people too with very real problems and challenges um but the highlight was actually working with him in berkeley producing this interview segment with joan chen and we ended up at the recording studio that discovered um ccr um and i mean the wall was full of all of these platinum records from this amazing you know rock band that i mean you know i think changed the landscape of music for folks so that was a thrill that s awesome kind of i guess how did your like working for you know and in the arts and the film kind of propel you into kind of working in the district for holly mitchell then so um i think the arts are really instructive for how we communicate with people um if it s theater if it s movies books tv it s really about storytelling right and how you listen how you um can transcribe a story how you can share people s perspectives that aren t like yours um and really how you become more comfortable in your own skin and i think when you re working in politics when you re doing advocacy which was what i was doing with holly at crystal stairs supervisor holly mitchell um at crystal stairs it s all about how do you make other people comfortable you know when you re sharing good news and bad news and how are you comfortable with yourself right right and so i think it really you know provided me some tools uh you know to make that work successful for me because it s hard you know at the time i was there we were having to tell people that the state didn t have any money and they were cutting budgets and we couldn t renew contracts and i mean that s hardcore for folks that are you know providing care for for kids and are really dependent on these reimbursement checks from the state at what moment did you know that you wanted to run for office at some point you know i asked that question to myself every day like is this really what you want to do you know i um my mother said when i was really little that i told her that i wanted to be in politics and so like a couple years ago she said do you remember when you said that as a little girl and i said no and you should have told me that was crazy making not to say that but i think after i helped miss mitchell get into the assembly and i served as her district director we and then in the senate we started working to nurture other women and women of color to run for office to and she was very supportive of young candidates and new candidates and you do so much work sort of training and like recruiting and supporting and you know sort of um critiquing that i thought well you know i m doing so much of this i probably could do this but it actually kind of took holly saying this is what you need to do you know you look around and it s about building a bench and so tag your red jump in um and you know and they re all kind of statistics that say you know you have to ask a woman three times to run before they decide and you know men wake up they go to the bathroom and they say they re gonna run for office um which is a joke which is a joke um so it actually took her telling me this is something you need to do like we need you in this space tag you re it for me to say maybe this is something i can do um you know and sometimes you wake up and you question is it the right decision do you have what it takes are you really making change in a way that s important um you know because i will say it s it s an awesome job but it s incredibly humbling i guess what what is so humbling about it can you kind of uh elaborate on that yeah so um the state is huge i mean they re like hundreds of agencies right they re thousands of employees and and everyone is doing something that s supposed to help the state work better and essentially that s supposed to provide services you know for the millions of folks that live in the state and it s a huge operation it s not going to work 100 correctly all the time in every nook and cranny of the state um and it s also the learning curve is quite high right because we as legislators part of our role is to create legislation that s about fixing policy that s about making the work work better right in the state with all of these nooks and crannies and departments and programs and initiatives it takes a minute to kind of figure out what those things are and what they do and how they work and what s the challenge and how and there s also so much connective tissue so that s humbling because most people run and they think they know everything and then you get here and you re like i don t think i know everything um which is like you know a heavy thing for a legislator to admit but i think that s one of the reasons why i do my watch wednesdays because i try to bring a little clarity and a little fun um to these concepts that are state government no they re interesting you know you started out in the assembly and then you kind of moved over to the senate kind of what what differences have you noticed between the assembly and the senate and kind of what what s your preference at this point so there are a lot of more there are a lot more people in the assembly and uh the color is green and so in this wing space we have different elevators we have different elevators on that you know in the capitol um i m being funny i do feel like it s more ruckus on the assembly book so i would go into a session to floor on the assembly and i swear to god i was like let me get my wheaties let me take my b12 let me put on my little helmet because something s about to jump off right um and on the senate it s much more um congenial well like ho senator oh senator and so um so that s different is this much smaller you know the the actual floor you know is like almost half the size so it does feel really tiny um but i will say i have i what s different for me is i had i came in and i had friendships that i developed on the assembly side you know before covid and when i came on to the senate it was during covet and so we were people were isolating we don t sit next to each other on the floor um and so we you don t really go out to events um so it has been much more of an isolating experience to be on the senate side because it s been harder to develop the kinds of relationships that i was able to develop on the assembly side not to say that the senators are nasty because they re not so senators if you re listening i m not saying you re nasty i m just saying covid has prevented us from like you know getting to know each other right i guess have you found that you know being on the senate is is i guess helping you get a lot more of your policies done than it would on the assembly side well you only have to count to 21 so easier that s a little easier but then you re like you know the gorilla that is the assembly is waiting for you um i feel like policy can be a little easier to get done on the senate side but i also feel like senators may i don t i shouldn t be telling any trade secrets but i do feel like senators it s harder to get you got to really talk to folks senators are like tell me about the policy what s this really about you know you re new what do you know you know so um now at the end of the day is the same man at the end of the day it s the same you gotta count your votes you gotta know what the bill is you got to work with your opposition you got to make sure your supporters are like you know got their stuff together you still got to have a well oiled machine on either side you know with redistricting happen it seems like you know musical chairs everyone s moving everywhere and you ve kind of had this a kind of an exciting announcement you re going to run for congress can you kind of tell us a little bit about uh your congressional race and kind of uh your thoughts behind running for congress so i don t know how much i can get into i don t want to get into trouble uh because i m here talking about state stuff um but great opportunities you know so many i think 22 is um going to be a turning point for the legislature because so many folks are retiring and other opportunities have opened up and so um you know people like me have looked at those kinds of opportunities i m it s bittersweet i love the work that i m doing and um love the policies that you know i plan to champion this year that we ve been successful at getting across the finish line last year um so i will say i m really excited that i don t want to get dinged for you know saying stuff i shouldn t be talking about on a state platform because you know the man does listen to the podcast i ain t trying to get in trouble with demand i think in congress you have to count like over 200 that s gonna be dude that s why i got a calculator i have a calculator here too i m like i got i do have a little vote card could you imagine like vote cards other places i ll be like five pages of a vote card overwhelming overwhelming can you kind of talk you you seem to have kind of like this this kind of serendipitous kind of like you know events of like you know moving from the assembly to the senate and now having this opportunity in in congress can you kind of kind of talk to that about kind of how you just had these cool opportunities kind of kind of do some different things here so yeah i um i know i have this like i don t know i don t want to say don t you hate when people like start talking about themselves and they like say all these amazing things and you re like dude you ain t that amazing so i don t want to say anything like that but i will say that um i consider myself you know a pretty hard worker and really strong work ethic i try not to piss people off immediately um and i really try to produce because i think at the end of the day that s what people care about like like what are you doing like what you know and um and how can we work together right and how can i be included in the thing that you re working on so that s sort of how my work ethic um translates into um you know my job performance and i just think people see that and you know unbeknownst to me i think folks have taken notice and they re like hey we we really like how she does things so we want her to carry a bill you know it s okay if i leave um you know because she can run for this um i want her to help me champion so i think it s that i also think it s luck you know right time right place um you know i knew for example that you know the senator was planning to run to be on the board of supervisors um but you know what i m gonna tell you something i knew she was gonna do that and i still was like it did not process in my mind that it was gonna happen while i was in the assembly and that i would be running for the senate so literally i was like oh yeah she s it s like she s gonna run and then she ll just be the senator and on the board and then i like very very late in the game i was like oh snap that means she s gonna go and then they re gonna have another election so you know sometimes i have like delayed reaction because i m like i can t believe we have to do this again and again yeah the grind and then like who wants to step into the shoes of holly mitchell big shoes to film big shoes to feel doing pretty well so far no and so senator ross whenever he sees me he s like how you doing i just love how we mentioned it s like how you doing i just love holly mitchell i m like hey dude what about me he s like tell holly mitchell i said that s funny you know you re kind of sharing a story about when you first got into kind of working in politics you know we had budget deficit deficits and you know cuts left and right and kind of for the last few years we ve had these big surpluses uh you know this year we have another huge budget surplus kind of what are some of your thoughts about the budget this year and some of the things you re looking you re looking to do well i am so grateful that i m working in a state that has been blessed with a surplus um amen to the gods and the goddesses um i certainly hope that the budget chair and the governor support all of my budget requests because they re all amazing and they should definitely be supported in case you re listening nancy skinner phil ting and governor newsom um but my hope is actually that this year we will really double down on investments for a statewide wellness initiative program we ve seen an uptick in suicides mental health i think is going to be the next pandemic you know you see it with not only the great resignation but the great malaise um i think there s been so much toxicity nationally um for the past four years and it s like anything when you get sick and you have an infection and you re not really working deliberately to heal you know infections can kind of fester and then grow and metastasize and i think that s what we re seeing with this you know increase in suicides increase in violence i mean there s toxicity not only in politics but sort of you know as folks are trying to re normalize what it means to socialize with intimidation and bullying and so um you know not just teachers not just students not just essential workers but you know other folks kind of across the workforce spectrums um so i really think we have to double down on that you know how we infuse behavioral health support but also mental health supports how we continue to destigmatize mental health and not just talk about it when we re talking about people who are unhoused or who use substances you know so many people are faking it until they make it and i think people are burnt out with that and that coupled with the tensions and the deaths from covid on you know have us at this very critical moment so my hope is that we really double down and deeply invest in this space you know that s that s interesting you point to that because you know a lot of talk has been about this great resignation about how people aren t coming back to work or looking to do different things and everyone s trying to get a pulse on what s what s happened and it doesn t just seem like life s gonna go back to how it was two years ago can you kind of talk about that and kind of what what you re seeing in your district and kind of your thoughts yeah so i love my district it s the 30th it will be the 28th um and so just to give people an idea of what it is we sort of are uh cocooned by uh freeways yes freeways in l a so we have the 10 freeway to the north the 110 to the east slauson um to the south no it s lawson like all the way to 120th and central so almost like to the 105 um and then the 405 to the west so we have really affluent neighborhoods and then we have folks that you know are certainly working class downtown central city chevrolet hills mid city ladera heights um mar vista palms so we ve seen everything you know you i represent folks that have been able to you know work from home and that have supports and have people coming in helping them with their kids have access to the vaccinations and the boosters and the tests you know very early on and then we have folks that are essential workers and are working a couple of jobs that have side hustles that are you know that are really important to how they you know make the rent um and people are really interested i think in being entrepreneurs um and finding their own way because quality of life has become incredibly important and like working someplace where you have to commute long distances where you might not have the kind of benefits that you need where you might not have the kind of time off that you need or the flexibility where you have a lot of folks living in your house and young kids helping other you know littler kids like manage um you know i see all of that in the homes of the constituents that i represent so covet has been great because it s encouraged people to come up with new you know business models for the jobs that they re trying to you know create um and it s been really tough um because many of the folks you know many of my communities you know were last to get the ppe they were last to get access to the tests they were last to get access to the vaccines so lots of um disparities across the spectrums but i love my district you know this is the second year of a two year session kind of what so what are some of the bills you i guess are kind of finishing up from last year and some new ones you re proposing this year well you know i was thinking about reintroducing ab369 which was my street medicine bill um that was about making sure that you could have mobile units mobile healthcare units to help folks get access to care uh who are unhoused but lo and behold it found its way into the state budget so somebody was listening um but i ve got a spicy package it s a little bit of uh criminal legal reform but you know having access to medical records um and being able to access you know get your identification that you need when you get out definitely going back to the health care space trying to rerun the bill about drug importation from canada um you know even florida with crazy desantis you know is trying to do this and you know we know that the costs are really um exorbitant and so how do we get cheaper prices right um working on that uh aca 3 which is about taking slavery and involuntary servitude out of the california constitution who would have thought um it s still in there shout out for um black history month uh we got like a lot of bills that actually this year that i m running are focusing on economic justice and equity so how do we bring parity right how do we take away some barriers that are preventing people from having access to capital and opportunities to um you know find and keep jobs and develop family wealth not family wealth like billions you know but like so i can make my mortgage and pay for my kid to have lunch at school and you know be able to wash my clothes and save some pennies and not be living paycheck to paycheck so i m really focused on on bills that will allow that to happen you know it s so cool what you do with these you know what what s happening wednesdays yes videos and explaining things kind of what s what s one piece of california politics or the legislature that you haven t explained yet that you would like people to understand so i have not explained what goes on in rules committee so i sit on rules and we do confirmations you know for the governor um that s kind of heady because you get all these binders about information about all these people in all these departments that s what i m like lord have mercy this is what you do so we haven t explained that we do have one coming out today um i am in contract negotiations with my puppets because there was such demand for them now they have presented me with these rider contracts you know they want the green m m s and they don t want to work on thursdays and so we re they re part of a puppet union and you know i am definitely pro labor uh so i m working with the puppets to come up with some you know other topics that they are willing to um discuss um but you know what happens in rules is a biggie right for the senate and the assembly and kind of how the floor runs people don t really know about that yeah you re right rules is such a mystery kind of what happens in rules stays in rules i know well that s right what happens in rule stays and rules we should do karaoke one day in rules i think so i said pro time let s do some karaoke while we re like trying to confirm this person for get the ratings out yes it s like cable access ain t nobody watching our hearings well awesome sydney thank you so much for taking the time and hanging out with us here uh just love the jacket and the outfit and looking forward to getting those puppets back to work thank

another episode of sac town talks today we have an interesting episode for you all we have matthew silver and jamie zoller joining us from the california association of code officers guys thanks for joining the program how s it going going well thank you so much for having us yeah so interesting so you guys are part of the california association of code officers can you kind of tell us a little bit about the association and kind of what are code officers well kco the california association of code enforcement officers is a statewide association that handles training legislation networking all incumbent with for code enforcement officers for the response for what a code enforcement officer is a code officer is an officer in a city or county who oversees and enforces local building codes zoning laws and ordinances we also handle health and safety issues such as substandard housing hoarding marijuana dispensaries and most recently our roles kind of switched to handle covenant enforcement as well and our goal is to ensure the quality of life for residents in our areas i might add if i could that you know i think the best way to think of a code enforcement officer number one is that we re not peace officers we are health and safety uh officers we re not sworn officers by and large secondly i call us the swiss army tool of every city we kind of do all the weird stuff or the stuff that the other departments building safety planning police don t deal with a lot of quality of life issues so i would say to your listeners when they re thinking about you know a problem in their neighborhood that bugs them every day or every night when they re thinking about a maybe the poor quality of housing they re living in those kind of things we re the ones who respond to those issues and deal with those issues it s a really wide array of things that we deal with to keep communities safe and kind of just running so that s interesting so you guys basically have a i guess like a code enforcement uh local government perspective but you guys aren t peace officers right you guys aren t you know you guys don t carry guns uh right and no formal training or academy is that correct we we do have formal training uh and that s a kind of a recent thing actually for a long time code enforcement didn t have kind of centralized standards or training a couple years ago kco uh put forward a bill that got signed into law that created for the first time uh set professional standards for what it means to be a certified code officer in the state and kco is the certifying body for that so we re kind of getting our act together so to speak and professionalizing and making more uniform our organization but you re right we don t carry guns we re not police officers we re not we don t want to be peace officers we appreciate what they do we support what they do but we are not they we re the ones out in the community dealing with kind of community quality of life issues although i ll tell you and this may be a subject for a later question um we are increasingly being tasked with dealing with issues that have been kind of what you think of as traditional policing drug dens drug houses uh illegal cannabis grows um prostitution issues human trafficking issues so this kind of change that s interesting so like you know i think first thing everyone hears is code enforcement officer they automatically think like parking tickets is that totally different subset am i off there there s some jurisdictions that would handle parking issues parking citations but no that s not at all what we focus on like matt said uh we focus on that quality of life for the residents in the community and helping to make sure that things are safe for them basically so like in sacramento we have like an app called like three one one if you have a problem you type it in the app and then somebody takes care of it whether it s you know it s a random car in front of your house uh you know or your neighbor s doing something uh is that kind of kind of what we re talking about here where where you guys kind of helping force you know county or city ordinances that s correct that s exactly what we do um there s different apps that each jurisdiction does have for their city for their citizens to be able to report different things whether it s the smell of or the odor of marijuana coming from their neighbor s house or short term vacation rental issues or hoarding issues or trash junk debris anything like that that s the type of things that we won t handle oh interesting and kind of i guess as you brought up you know for the past year covet 19 has been present and i guess you guys have taken a new role kind of enforcing a lot of these county health orders can you kind of talk to us about that and how that s kind of gone this past year absolutely uh we have been handling anything from mass enforcement to making sure that people are wearing masks out in the public or in businesses um at various stages the yellow stage orange stage whatever stage that county or region is in to making sure that those businesses are closed or they re not operating during certain levels thank goodness right now we re not having to deal with that and most of our businesses are open and things are changing greatly and the mask requirements are changing so our role is continuing to change even with that yeah as i imagine you know a lot of these covet 19 issues were uh people were very passionate about it you know you see a lot of grocery stores and increasing their uh you know armed presence uh you know because people were uh upset about mass spandex things like that kind of what what kind of risks has have health officers seen out there code enforcement officers seen uh kind of enforcing a lot of these things this this past year just what you explained i rate people angry frustrated people we re all um in similar situations where we re having to deal with job losses and um you know people dying in our families and all sorts of very stressful situations so people s stress levels and lack of patience is running high so when that happens then obviously the code enforcement officers law enforcement and other people are their safeties out so yeah it s a great point about covet i mean it s definitely the dangers are escalated for code enforcement officers kind of thrust out in the field enforcing these coveted rules however this is nothing new we deal with uh some really touchy issues we go on private property which raises some real sensitivities and you know that can include going into a slumlords property where they ve got a bunch of tenants they re taking rent from them they don t appreciate us being there getting in the way of their revenue this might be dealing with things like you know cannabis where we ve got this kind of state experiment i would call it to legalize a portion of cannabis but in order for that those cultivators to survive legally the illegal ones have to be shut down and these can be some touchy issues as well so it s not new but it is escalating yeah i guess it s an interesting point so as as non sworn um you know enforcers of of the law how do you guys handle these situations and and i guess at what point do you call law enforcement in to help assist you with uh what you re doing i guess kind of what s your hammer to enforce a lot of this stuff that s a great question how do we handle it uh i think it just is on a case by case basis uh it depends if we have knowledge that um there s an issue at the property or there s some type of volatile situation we absolutely will take law enforcement with us because they have the tools to be able to protect us because we do not if we don t know what we re walking into that s where the danger really comes in too we have many situations and scenarios personally and from our our partners that have gone through different things and different scenarios where it was just an average call and it was just i was going to knock on someone s door something as simple as that so you just really don t know no definitely not good i imagine there s a lot of uh uncertain things i remember you know back in 2010 i worked as a as a census worker and just going door to door and just kind of never know what s behind those doors and it s not definitely not a fun experience i could only imagine when you went uh and kind of tried to enforce some things but i guess you know is it is it mostly you know writing letters and civil fines is that s kind of what what these people are looking at okay we ve got we ve got kind of a whole toolbox of tools that we use it it escalates in code enforcement almost across the board number one we re reactive in nature so we get involved what a neighbor sometimes a tenant in like a substandard building calls us we re not out there looking for violations by and large we don t have the personnel or the time for that so we ll do an inspection a kind of an in person conversation with the individual uh then there s a letter to notice a violation saying here s the violations you ve got by this time to fix it and here s how to fix it right so they ve got a chance there to do it voluntarily it doesn t work then they ll usually issue some kind of local fine we call it an administrative fund it s like a parking ticket pretty much yeah uh to kind of encourage compliance if that doesn t work then we go to court and court oftentimes is civil enforcement and that can take different aspects right so it is interesting i guess you know as part of the association i guess you know i guess who is part of the association kind of what what are the things you guys are are working on this year the association is made up of um code enforcement officers from around the state of california they consist of managers line level officers supervisors we have technicians code techs so it s all encompassing so that is who casey was really made up and is it is it a city and county thing or is you know do some counties have their own thing encompassing cities as well or well casey is a statewide kc is a statewide association so it encompasses all um city and county so anyone can participate in that training and like matt was saying before more often not than these officers are becoming certified through our association as well to obtain that training for anything from officer safety to zoning and landing land use regulations anything to that feature so uh as jamie as jamie could uh attest to code enforcement our association is made up of a lot of different folks code enforcement officers code enforcement managers uh county people city people anybody who s involved in code enforcement uh is a part of our group in the state or statewide organization uh we re really busy we re involved in a lot we re really trying to push the profession and uh help ensure that we can continue meeting the statewide goals and uh policies that our legislators are setting for us so this year our focus has been on code enforcement officer safety we can t meet those goals we can t protect our communities if we re not safe in doing our jobs and unfortunately the safety standards just have not caught up to the work that we re doing and so one bill we have right now is senate bill 296 this bill would require every city and county to establish safety standards for code enforcement officers specific to the threats they face in their jurisdiction so we recognize that code officers in different places around the state face different issues so it s not a one size fits all approach it just simply says cities and counties you have to have some kind of standards it s got to be specific to the threats we face okay and i guess sb296 who who s carrying that bill and kind of who s supporting it senator limon uh out of the ventura county area is supporting it we are so thankful to her and her team for carrying this bill and helping us push this important cause the congress on racial equality i think is a supporter worth mentioning they recognize that code enforcement officers are really i would say the main people on the front lines trying to improve communities that are struggling communities that often core and their partners serve that are really trying to improve and and make it a better safer place so we we really appreciate their support we have support from other housing groups there really is no opposition to this bill oh interesting yeah kind of without everything brought out in the last year with kind of inequities and so forth you guys are are right at the center of you know enforcing a lot of these things that uh you know try to keep an even playing field out there so thank you for that um i guess you know before we go you know all of us haven t been in social settings i imagine when you guys go to a cocktail party people ask you what you do and you say you re a code enforcement officer and they re like what is that do you guys each have you know a story that explains not only what you do but something funny that s happened in in your world of code enforcement goodness that s a good question and yeah absolutely um i think some of the funnier ones that we ve had to deal with or that i ve had to deal with personally um is trying to identify a chicken to see what if it s a chicken or a rooster i mean whole education on chickens that s gone on um they have service chickens now too so you know there s they re important not just for eggs that s funny what about yourself matt yeah um so you know it s funny i was i was offered a job as a code officer when i was in college i had no idea what the heck a code officer was and you know i m actually a practicing lawyer and a certified code officer i represent code folks throughout the state and uh it s it s funny i still struggle to explain it to folks what do we do so i i like to just say we keep communities clean if you if you have an issue you complain about we re the ones dealing with that issue right right um funny story you know i gosh something i love about it is uh you never see you never cease to be amazed it s always something new i remember having a lot of bizarre cases but one of them was a uh illegal fighting ring with also coupled up with an unlicensed dentistry office so i guess it was like a bet on rooster number five and then go get your molar fixed or something interesting combination there that s too much that s funny both involving chicken so uh right good good poultry out there going good to know you know everyone s doing those backyard chicken things these days you know i can just i can see that being a problem you know yeah yeah and that s you know that s kind of the lighter side of it obviously we deal with some really heavy issues with housing that s a really big thing i read some stat the other day that there s like you know tens of millions of people in our country who are living in substandard housing you know we may be a really rich economy but we have a tremendous substandard housing crisis in california ghost ship fire in oakland 36 people died or so something around there that was that s exactly something we we deal with and try to do better to prevent and encompassing too with that is you know like matt was saying it s not all funny or um you know with the substandard housing but it s it can be very dangerous um you know spinoff too from kco our association has been the code enforcement officer safety foundation which is actually focused on officer safety um specifically and because of certain situations um like uh jill robinson from the city of utah i m sorry the state of utah uh in 2018 she had an open property nuisance case at a location she went to the property to meet the homeowner to talk about all the violations and he showed up with a gun and shot her through her city truck door and then lit her on fire and let the neighbor s house on fire so i mean just very tragic things like that and she was just going there for a regular um you know talking to the person and just that first meet up yeah yeah we ve had about 20 code officers actually murdered in the line of duty and i think you know most people don t know what a code officer is and they certainly aren t going to know the risks that we face so whereas you know we face all sorts of threats intimidation all sorts of things you can imagine people aren t always appreciative uh of course the people who call and complain the tenants whose lives we save they re appreciative but um you know these other folks aren t so appreciative so all the more reason we re so thankful uh for you helping us spread this awareness and having us on your show talk about what it is we do and good hearted people trying to do good things yeah and i guess you know before we go can you i guess give us some information about how we can find a little bit more about the association online and i guess find you on social media and stuff like that absolutely thank you for asking that kco has a website it s kcocaceo us you can find us there you can also find us on linkedin and facebook our website has all of our information about how to contact us how to volunteer how to become involved in our profession and our social media platforms assist us with advertising our training and certification processes for people that are in the code enforcement profession yeah and i guess one one last question for you before you guys go if if some of our listeners have some some issues they think they re a code enforcement issue what what s the best way to i guess notify you guys to come take a look at and um kind of address it each jurisdiction has a website for instance i m in the san diego county area so it just depends on what city or county that you live in they will have a website and a code compliance code enforcement or community enhancement and safety link on their websites that you can click on and file complaints online and and i guess are these complaints usually uh what do they call that um you know anonymous anonymous right because i think that s always an apprehension people have oh if i knock this person out they ll know it s me and then i m going to get it of course no they mostly i know that every jurisdiction in san diego county is all anonymous because of that reason they don t want to have the person complaining fearing retribution or any type of retaliation so we really do protect um the people who are complaining they re anonymous by law uh in the state and so uh for that very reason right a neighbor a lot it s almost always a neighbor complaining about a neighbor or a tenant complaining about their their landlord and so uh for that reason it s anonymous by law okay awesome well thank you so much guys for taking some time and explaining to us about coding officers it was definitely educational and uh it was great interesting episode so thank you so much for joining us guys thank you for having us thank you for having us,"enforcement officers,police,gun,police

still in the midst of this pandemic and um one of the things that s important to me not only as a physician but you know as a mom with kids in school is that we are able to keep all californians hate healthy and safe that we re able to keep our schools open and our businesses um thriving and so there are a group of us um that people affectionately call the vax caucus or the vaccine caucus oh really yeah and um and so with us we have introduced eight bills so far dealing with vaccines um or around covet in general and so my the bill that i am pushing out from that caucus is ab1797 which deals with updating the california immunization registry and what this would do is one gives schools the ability to have you know access to the immunization registry the california immunization registry they do have limited access at this point but only can really only report on those vaccines that are required um and so you know it s hard right now for them to to say who s been vaccinated with covered vaccine or not because that s not a required vaccine at this point um and it also requires physicians that give out vaccines to make sure that they re putting this information into the vaccine registry and then the other thing the bill does which is very important is that as you re putting the information into the vaccine registry you also input the race and ethnicity unless the particular patient or parent opts out and the reason why this is so important is because we know about health disparities we know about um issues as far as who s getting immunizations and who s who is not and so this is actual data to prove that uh there are some disparities there or there aren t and if there are disparities then we can focus our efforts and resources on those communities to help make sure that we re getting um the information to them and that we re also providing access for for those communities to become vaccinated so that s a big part a big priority for me you know you were talking about how you were in this what is it what do you guys call the vaccine caucus is that what you guys call yourself that s what we re yeah that s what we re kind of known as it s um and we got together we started this um actually during the summer recess last year because we kind of saw that there may be an uptick in covet around uh winter time but it s um myself assembly member lowe assembly member wix um senator pan senator newman and senator weiner and we ve been working on these bills and kind of you know i guess is it surprising to you seeing this kind of vaccine hesitancy and you know a lot of discussion about kids and vaccines and uh you know it kind of bewildering to me and a lot of people but you know it seems to be a major issue and kind of what do you guys expect and you know how how do you deal with this yeah well you know it s definitely unfortunate it s um you know i think that over time um there s just been a growing number of people who are just against vaccines in general but with this particular um virus and this particular vaccine it was so politicized and i in my lifetime do not remember anything like this being politicized you know whether it was the flu or ebola somewhere else like i don t remember you know it s science is science and um and so i think because it was so politicized that s why we re saying what we re seeing today i mean and i was talking to a friend earlier because i was looking at like vaccination race from different states and um you know you can you can see the difference unfortunately in what are considered quote blue states and what are considered quote red states in terms of um the percent of facts of their population that it s vaccinated so it s that s why we re seeing it this time i mean i think that it s natural to be um concerned about something new um i i admit you know when i got the vaccine i was like oh my goodness because i was practicing at the time i was doing surgeries and so the first week that it came out i had to get it and i was like oh my god oh my god but now we ve had so many people that have gotten the vaccine that um you know there have been more people that have gotten it than we ve had in any previous study or trial or anything before anything came came out that you know a lot of the the concern or the rhetoric is is completely unfounded um there was a mother at my son s school who said oh i m not gonna have my daughter get the vaccine because i want her to have children in the future i was like what wait huh you know so because now there s this thought that it s going to cause infertility so um it s it s it s unfortunate um it s unfortunate because it is a virus that is still very contagious and for those who are not vaccinated it is potentially so very deadly and um you know it s also a virus that you don t know once you get it what that long haul syndrome is going to be for you and um you know i have uh my dad is from louisiana i went to school and i went to college in louisiana and i have family in louisiana that think a little different than i do and i spoke with one of my cousins a few weeks ago and found out that he had just gotten out of the hospital because he s not vaccinated and he had been in with covid for um 22 days in the icu 18 of those days i see 18 of those days because he believed that the vaccine had killed someone so it s um it is it is unfortunate that it s been so politicized because it allows for all this misinformation and disinformation to get out there and just run rampant in our communities right make sure you

you touched upon is the bureaucracy of water right uh you know you have the federal government we have a state agency we have local irrigation differences and stuff like that can you you know for our listeners who don t understand the bureaucracy of water can you kind of give us an overview of of kind of the state s you know bureaucracy and the local government s bureaucracy kind of on how waters divvied up in the state yeah look i there s i think about close to 20 or if not a little over 20 different agencies that touch on on water issues we have the department of water resources we have the water resources control board we have the department of fish and wildlife uh we have the um the local water boards we have the water commission there s just there s so many agencies that touch on different aspects from the allocation of water to water rights which the water resources control board is responsible for to infrastructure infrastructure for local communities infrastructure for a state you know statewide water supply like like dan s and whatnot so there s there s a lot of bureaucracy that look um just last year we had uh there was an attack on a on a water treatment plant in the bay area and and it it it was an attack on it was a cyber attack and so this is what um less water supply around the world is going to create these types of challenges and if we re already beginning to see that those kinds of attacks in the state and we re not protected um we re way behind and we need to have a a system in in california that works and that protects uh the limited water supply and that protects californians in every aspect that you can possibly think of because climate change is going to create just exactly those types of scenarios and if not it s going to make it worse right you know that s interesting you know you re kind of talking about your canal bill and then you listed all those 20 agencies and you know i just started you know getting anxiety thinking about how to work with all those agencies to try to achieve something kind of you know there s got to be a way to simplify this kind of what kind of what are your thoughts to kind of streamlining this kind of bureaucracy to make it you know easier to achieve you know goals that work for all californians well look i m going to be honest and say that i wish that i had the perfect solution or the answer to that and the reality is that um that i that i don t because i don t know exactly every detail of the job that uh someone that works in dwr or someone that works at the wall you know at the water resource control board or or the epa and so why i think that the whole goal of sb1219 is to bring this interagency work group together to be able to say okay this is what this these are the different departments this is where we can kind of um maybe we need some reorganization in this area or i mean that s the whole point of it is that how how can we how can they the experts of that do the day to day work um that see all the issues and challenges but also the they have to see also the potential solutions to how do you better uh work together and make sure that it s that it s simple you know yeah a couple of months ago we had dr marty ralph come on a climatologist kind of talk about atmospheric rivers and he was kind of going over kind of uh you know working with the federal government a lot of a lot of things dealing with water are a bit antiquated you know dealing from the 1960s and things like that and i guess you know in dealing with the you know the state water system especially the state water control board kind of you know how are you finding how it s antiquated and how maybe it might be you know able to kind of bring it up to modern times to help us deal with today s challenges well every day i learned something new i will admit and i ll say that just the the fact that we have cyber attacks to try to poison water i mean who would ever thought in the 1960s and and some laws even earlier that something of the sort would even happen where with just you know a little uh moving of your computer you can poison an entire community s water we didn t have that in mind and that s why there s a major need to modernize uh this i ve also been working in um trying to learn a little bit more about the role that nasa is playing in terms of the research that they re doing and studying the the future of deltas and water management and uh you know there s just so much research that people are working on that we need to just find more information there s a lot of technology out there that nasa is also working on and trying to measure water availability so these are all the types of things that we need to kind of bring in and and uh you know figure out what what additional needs we may have maybe the technology and the tools that are being worked on at the moment are not enough that they need to be improved and how do we improve those but i think we have a system in place that we we don t even know how much water is being uh perhaps stolen or where exactly water is going that s you know all information that we need to be able to to collect and improve on but the tools and the resources uh are there s tools and resources out there already that we could bring in but i also think we need to look at the future what additional tools and

another episode of sac town talks today we have a special guest joining us rebecca bauer khan joining us rebecca how s it going thanks for joining us it s good thanks for having me fun to be on today i know thanks thanks for coming on and talking a little bit about yourself and kind of your road here can you kind of give us a little background on yourself and how you ended up in sacramento good question so i went with california native so that part i got going for me but um yeah i never envisioned myself ending up elected official or politician but here i am i am an attorney by training i went to georgetown law and became a litigator which is what i did for many years uh specializing in environmental regulatory work then i went and taught law school um i did that for about eight years and then 2016 came and went and the world changed for me i am i m the granddaughter of refugees my grandparents were holocaust survivors my grandmother was still alive in 2016 when um donald trump was elected and for the first time in my life i saw my grandmother afraid and that was really powerful she had left vienna austria at 18 years old so she very much remembered and knew what had happened to her family and lost family members in the war and had always believed so deeply in this country that had saved her and her family and for the first time she she saw us taking a turn down a really scary path and i think that woke me up to what this country needed and i believed that i had to do my part i started by doing pro bono work it was my bread and butter it s what i had done my for my career i organized the attorneys at sfo after the muslim ban it felt like a very full circle moment for me i had that s how my family had come to this country right as refugees and here i was helping people who were landing in the same circumstances enter our country and it invigorated me and it gave me hope and what i saw that day was that if each of us stepped up and did our part that our country could continue to follow the values that each of us holds and so i decided i had to do more and through that process decided that the best thing to do was to run for the state legislature and do my part as a californian who was going to really hold the line on the issues that i hold near and dear climate change being one of my top priorities knowing that if we deregulated at the federal level it was really going to come down to california to hold the line and protect our future and the future of my children so i ran for office and i won and i ve had the privilege of representing my district for three years wait so you ran in in 2018 right 2016 oh 2018 yeah elected in 2018 sorry 2018 okay yeah and that was you know that c was held by catherine baker previously right that s kind of a swing state so i guess coming out of nowhere in you know in 2016 to 2018 that s a pretty uh major accomplishment um you know how i guess how did you kind of you know get the support of the local kind of party and things like that to kind of become the front runner and kind of win that seat you know i d been a part of the community for a long time i was on a committee of my school board i had um worked with a lot of community members on an effort to do steam labs at all of our local elementary schools i was on the board of my synagogue so i was involved in the community in meaningful ways volunteer for moms demand action um but this wasn t in my sights and then when i decided that this was something i would take on i was really my community that stepped up and um backed me and said they wanted someone who was going to represent their values and really do the work that they wanted done at this moment in time so it was a grassroots effort of people who believed in me and we did it i was kind of our teeth so are are you originally from from you know the the bay area or you know have you trained you know going to law school in georgetown you know on the other side of the country i guess kind of what what brought you back here to the bay yeah so i m originally from the peninsula um born and raised in silicon valley and uh but i went back east for both my undergrad and my law degree but i m a californian so i practiced law for one year in dc and i just found that it wasn t my speed i needed to come home and so i ended up transferring to a law firm in san francisco and practicing out here and i uh i was dating my now husband at the time who was living out here so he may have been part of the reason a small part small part so you know this is you know always was so interesting to me you know going to law school practicing the law and then going to make the law kind of kind of what were your thoughts going in of of of how the legislature worked and you know making laws you know as a professor and as an attorney to now you know being in it and actually doing it kind of what was your sense beforehand and you know now that you re doing it you know what kind of your thoughts on you know how bills are made and laws are made yeah i like the way you phrase that question because often people say you know how did it meet your expectations i didn t know what to expect right i never did in the legislature i never worked in the legislature i had really spent most of my career in the judicial branch right as um as a litigator and here i was going to work in the legislative branch um obviously doing having done a ton of work in the law i understand the law in a deep way but making it is very different um but i actually found one of the most fascinating things was how transferable my skill set was when you think about um you know a trial lawyer and a litigator right most of the time our cases don t go to trial right they settle right so it s a negotiation how do you find a way to get to where everyone feels good about the resolution and that work of making policy is very similar right you have a goal you re out to accomplish this goal but how do you get people with different views to come to the table to sit down with you to figure out a way to meet in the middle and move the policy goal forward so it has actually been more similar than i expected um some days i wish we had a judge who would be the ultimate arbiter we don t have that it is similar right i remember like one of the first bills i started working on and you know there were some amendments that came in and i was like well but that s not constitutional and my response was well it has the votes you know go to the courts later and i was like wow this is a different world it s very different yeah um so kind of you know being an environmental lawyer by trade and kind of you know knowing that aspect kind of how have you used that kind of in you know making laws or you know i guess searching changes and kind of some of the environmental policies here in the state yeah i mean one of the things is that i think we are incredible at in california is setting goals knowing where we want to go to protect climate to be where we are to give our children the future they deserve and i think the background that i have as a regulatory lawyer which is very in the weeds right i mean this is nuanced work i think has brought to bear really detail oriented how do we get to those goals right i mean yes we want all clean vehicles we want a clean energy future but what are the steps we have to take to actually achieve that to get to where california needs to be and so um you know we introduced a bill last year that we ll continue to work on that related to pollinators you know focused on how we keep our food chain clean and healthy and my first year i worked on clean water and farming right i ve done a lot of work in clean water and really focused on how do we transition our small farmers to more sustainable practices both with drought and with making sure our water tables remain clean um i ve gotten involved in the efforts around pfas in our water i have wells in my own district that have had to shut down as a result of too much of that carcinogen and the well so how do we get those clean how do we support our communities in doing that how do we prevent those carcinogens from entering the water table um i supported a bill senator allen moved around um firefighting foam which has that pfloss and we re removing it because we many of the wells in my district were near a firefighting training center was that how we had contaminated um the water and so we don t know the answer to that but we should be doing everything we can to do our best so really using that nuanced um work to make sure that i m moving the ball forward on the things that really matter to have a clean healthy environment yeah so i guess since you came into in the legislature in 2018 maybe you had one kind of normal session but it s been i guess kind of crazy uh ever since then with remote things and build limits so kind of you know you guys were all limited to 12 bills this year kind of what are some of the things that you focused on and worked on and kind of what d you get to the governor s desk this year yeah i mean you know i entered as you mentioned i entered the legislation a different time pre pandemic um with a vision of what this would look like for me and obviously all of our lives changed when kovid took over our lives and that s true of the work we re doing in the legislature we went from a set of priorities to really focused on our communities in a very different way of helping them get through this incredibly trying time and so i ve done some bills to assist with that i did a couple of small business bills really focused on our businesses in california that have suffered from these open close open closed policies we ve had to do to keep our communities safe so one of those is related to um you know mediation for our small businesses so they won t have to bear the brunt of litigation costs if they violate some of our employment laws giving an opportunity for free mediation which is much less costly for small businesses than if you have to go to court um we did a bill on alcohol to go thank you very much policy i know right one of my colleagues from across the aisle said it was his favorite bill of the year um but you know that s been a lifeline for our small restaurants right the ability to get those extra dollars on those to go orders i still have three unvaccinated children so i m still shy to eat indoors in a restaurant but we do take out to support our local businesses and i m happy to do that so really looking at how we can support our businesses and our community their health but also not forgetting what i was elected to do right i was um i came in committed to fighting climate change and we ll continue to do that so we ve moved um several pieces of legislation to prevent wildfires it s the largest source of emissions right now we really have to get a handle on it both for our safety but also for climate change so we moved two bills on that issue again we moved that bill on um pollinators and then women s rights it s a huge issue reproductive rights at this moment in time california has to continue to lead um i m the chair of the select committee on reproductive health so we re really looking at how we can continue to provide access to women to comprehensive reproductive health care including abortions so we had a bill signed into law a couple weeks ago that will protect our patients and our workers at our clinics making sure that we have safe and comprehensive access because that s the biggest threat right now are these um threats that are happening in front of and to our clinic workers and patients and then you know uh what else so much laughter what about a bill you know that has gotten i guess a lot of press recently because it s you know kind of we ll have to educate ourselves on but what about ab988 can you tell us a little bit about that kind of a new mental health crisis hotline you started yeah that s one of my babies it did not make it to the governor s desk we re going to keep working on that in january um but it is very near and dear to my heart one of the things that i um i have a background in some criminal defense work while i was practicing i ran our pro bono program and had the opportunity to work in the criminal justice system so that s been a real priority for me is figuring out how we can provide a more just system and um through the opportunity of getting to know a family in my district who lost their son to um police officer shooting when he was in the middle of mental health crisis i really learned how we were failing those who are in mental health crisis and so 988 was really born out of that and what it will do is it will take those in mental health crisis out of the criminal justice system so you will not call 9 1 1 and get a police response instead you ll call 988 and you ll get a mental health response you ll get a health care response which is exactly what you deserve and it is a big lift so we re going to fund an entire system of mobile crisis response teams and stabilization services for those who are in crisis but it s really critical work because 25 percent of officer involved shootings are those in mental health crisis and all those people need is a health care response so if we take that out of the equation it makes a huge difference in what s happening on our streets so i i guess what was the roadblock you faced was it was it a funding issue or was there something else so the bill um well we did have a big win so we got 20 we got um i think it s 20 million dollars in startup costs uh so we are starting to do the build up of the call centers so that we will go live in july with 988 but we are doing ongoing funding so it has a fee in it that will cover the funding for all of the phone system the stabilization series services and those crisis response teams and we just needed a little bit more time to figure out how we would do this in a state of this size as you imagine our counties are not all the same and they don t they don t all look the same right i mean you have urban counties you re rural counties you ve small counties big counties so how do we create a system that works for every californian when every californian is not similarly situated both by funding it properly and also creating a system that achieves the goal the legislature wants to achieve which is removing law enforcement from these calls when they re not the appropriate responder and ensuring that they get an immediate response when that s what s necessary so we just need more time to work out what that will look like but we re optimistic that it ll happen this year so you know i guess we had record budget surpluses this year and you know a lot of programs were funded what was you know in addition to this program i guess what other sorts of things were you able to i guess get you know for your district or some other priority yeah so one of the other huge victories thing i ve been working on since my first year in the legislature which was only three years ago but it s still through so long time was a piece of open space we ve been trying to protect out in livermore in eastern alameda county uh the diablo range is an incredible range for wildlife corridor and there is a piece of open space right now that is a pinch point in that wildlife corridor where the wildlife can go down the range and um that was going to be turned into an off road vehicle park which would really be disastrous for the wildlife the species that live on the land those that move on the land and also um the historic and native american elements that are there so we ve been working to save it and this year in the budget we were able to get the funds to do that and to save that land in perpetuity and it will turn into a passive recreation a hiking park where nature and um the community can co exist in ways that are really harmonious so that was a huge win i think for open space for my community and for climate so that s big we continue to work um towards more funding for transportation that s really important in the part of the bay area i represent where people have long commutes so we re working on more funding there although we haven t gotten all the way there we ll continue to focus on that we have a train out that we want to connect the central valley into dublin pleasant and bart station called valley link it s really critical in some of what s happening the two two of the top ten longest commutes are right out there in stockton um and so we really want to give those people easier commutes into the jobs in the bay area and take some of that traffic off the road in that valley where we re seeing a lot of um obviously air emissions as a result um so that s something we re working on we were able to um get more parks and uh other great things for the district that we re excited to see um come to fruition in the next year yeah driving that 205 over the ultimate pass you know was bad 10 years ago i can t even imagine what it is now yeah and trucking has increased so much right we re all ordering on amazon so there s more and more trucks on the road which is the route they take and all the the centers are right there on in the valley right yep all shipped over the hill wow increase so you know you just had you know the end of session uh you guys ended early for the first time uh ever which was amazing so kind of what that 12 bill limit is it here to stay what what are you planning for next year have you already you know started looking at you know what what you re looking at next year and kind of some of the things you want to do we are i mean i think you know it s a it s always a process i always want to do more than we have um the bandwidth to do there s so much good to be done in california um and we have constituents who are so supportive of some incredible work so we ll continue to work on 988 we really are committed to getting to the finish line on that bill and changing the way mental health is dealt with in california i think that ll be an ongoing effort um the bill that is before us when that becomes law we have to build the infrastructure under it we have to have a full series of mental health services for those that need it in california i m going to continue to work on juvenile justice issues one of my um really one of my favorite bills this year although i think i say that about all of them to be honest with you is a bill that allowed for an immediate and expedited appeal for juveniles who are being transferred from juvenile court to adult court prior to this there was no um required appeal for those youth and it is the most consequential decision they will face is whether they leave the juvenile system which is really rehabilitative and go into the adult system where they re in with adults and we know that their outcome won t be as good and so we re able to give them an appeal to get a review of that decision and ensure that they re in the right part of our system and i feel really good about that you know it s about 100 youth a year they get transferred and those youth now will take a second look at whether that s the right decision for them in their case so we re going to continue down that path looking at how we can help the juveniles in our system get better rehabilitation i have a bill pending on recidivism and rehabilitation and the money we re spending on it making sure that we are spending those dollars wisely and getting the results that those that are in the system need and that our communities need to stay safe we ll continue down the environmental path we re going to continue to try to do wildfire prevention and work on those bills that ensure that pg e is doing right by californians and keeping us safe holding their feet too i won t say future fire because that s the wrong analogy here but making sure that they re doing um responsible things with our lines they should be able to provide safe reliable energy and they have failed to do that so we re gonna make sure that happens um and yeah just keep working doing the good work we ve been doing you know something you touched on earlier kind of was like the environmental kind of things in greenhouse gases and kind of global warming you know california is trying to do so much um but i guess what i guess what more can we do like what more is there to do uh you know on that subject to kind of get us in an area where you know we start seeing results yeah i mean they say so the two largest things we can do are wild fire prevention prevent the release of all of these you know i mean these trees are all holding all of those emissions and they just go up in flames it s really bad for our environment so i do believe wildfire prevention has to be top of list for us but the second is transportation is the largest source of emissions right we know that and so we have to do more and better and currently you know we have a lot of electric vehicle drivers in our our wealthier communities but it s not accessible to every californian our trucks are not clean right now and we could move to a clean trucking future and we should so how do we really revolutionize transportation to ensure that we are not emitting there um i also think there s a lot we need to do on drought resiliency right i mean we re seeing it right now the reason that we are in the situation we re in is because it was too hot too fast right and we didn t capture enough water so how do we capture more water and again i ll say it i said it already on this podcast but how do we keep our water tables clean how do we put groundwater into the ground and keep it clean so it s accessible to us when we need it so there is a lot of work still to be done i know california s leading the way but trust me we re not done and plastics i didn t mention plastics why is california failing to respond to the cry of our californians and constituents that they want us to regulate plastic so we ve got to do that too you know wildfire has been a topic it feels like for a decade but maybe it s only been five years and we keep increasing funding and doing certain things i guess what aren t we currently doing that we need to do more of well i mean i m biased because this is what my legislation is trying to do but i do think um we do need you know we have a real problem with these pg e cause wildfires and i think we need to be doing more oversight there i ve said it publicly in hearings i don t think the puc is um sufficiently overseeing pg e to ensure that we re doing everything we can to stop our lines from causing wildfires so i introduced legislation two years ago and pushed it again this year that would give our local district attorney s oversight authority over those um wildfire mitigation measures that pg e should be putting into place we need local individuals overseeing this and making sure that we are actually enforcing the laws that are on the books because the laws are there but we don t have the bandwidth to enforce them and so we need more of that um so i think that s really big and then we have to you talk about the spending but we re not seeing the mitigation work we need done right we re not seeing our forests thinned in the way we need and that is why these spires are so out of control and go for so long so we do need to be doing that work and doing it in a meaningful way which then begs the question what do we do with all that material we re thinning out of the forests because that is a real problem and we have to deal with it and that has been a real controversy in the legislature but i have been supportive of using it to create energy because we have it we need to deal with it and burning it can actually be a way to to hold off those emissions and use the energy and to create alternatives to natural gas and fossil fuels interesting and you know earlier you mentioned you had three unvaccinated children at home so i assume that means they re all under 12 i should have said that yes they re all they won t be fascinated when they can be uh kind of how has that experience been i guess the last year you know dealing with uh you know three children at home and uh working the legislature back and forth and distance learning and that and the like you know there was a group of us that were at the forefront of the movement to really push california to reopen schools and all of us had young children who were at home learning with us and we were seeing firsthand what it was doing to them both in you know learning uh pushing their learning back and slowing it down but also the mental health toll it was taking on them and being isolated and you know i see my son is in second grade so he left in the middle of kindergarten and then missed all of first grade and is now in second grade and they do not have the social emotional skills than my other two did when they were in second grade because they missed really critical years of being with other children and engaging with them and learning those skills and so we have a lot of work to do but it was hard like every other working uh parent and working mother it was a lot of juggling for those that were in meetings with me when recess happened all the kids would come in and be in my meetings during recess um but you know we were all making it work and doing our best and serving the constituents my office and i you know served thousands of individuals who needed edd help we supported our small businesses and we did the best we could and my kids were just alongside to see it all happen yeah wow amazing well awesome well hopefully they can stay in school i have never done so much assisted coloring i was like man this is bad this coloring so no the math i have to tell you common for math i was like we need to go back to the classroom because i do not know how to do common format yeah that was no fun either yeah but assembly member garcia became the math tutor the kids at the legislature oh that s good but there s a little insider that did have a math expert there at your fingertips so yeah good resources that s awesome well thank you so much for joining us awesome information and it was good hearing from you and uh hope to check in with you uh later next year to see what you re up to and uh continue uh learning more about what more can be done awesome well

another episode of sac town talks your host here jared blanyon joined by melissa hurtado from the 14th senate district melissa how s it going thanks for joining us it s going well thank you uh for having me for the invitation and it s it s such a pleasure to be here with you today thank you where are you uh recording from today i m recording out of uh sanger california my hometown it s i m inside my bedroom my bedroom office and where d you grow up i grew up here i grew up in sangra i was born in fresno and uh get raised here uh my entire life what is there a popular eatery in sanger yes there is chuck wagon okay you always hear you know these towns down in the valley they always have that sanger is one of those you always hear about but you don t necessarily know so so what what brought you from sanger all the way up to sacramento what made you want to join uh the senate and being elected yes and thank you for the question before i you know begin to answer that i really want to take a moment to um to really honor the the memory of the founder of sac town talks um scotland he is someone that as a college student at cal state sacramento that a lot of us looked up to and kind of always wanted to you know hear from moore and and being a college democrat there we he was an inspiration to all of us and particularly his interest on community colleges and that s something that i also have a big interest in so he was a visionary and you know my condolences to you all at sac town talks but also to his family and friends yes thank you well well put yeah and um yeah to touch on the reason why i decided to come to sacramento really stems from my upbringing um poverty in the central valley uh really after the recession the central valley never really fully recovered and not only did was i hearing it from from loved ones from uh from friends i was also experiencing it and you know as as a daughter of immigrant parents you re told go to you know go to college and you ll do better than we did and so i did that and and your life hasn t been uh better than my parents my my parents were able to accomplish more with no college education with no high school diploma with only a third grade education coming here to america coming here to the central valley uh and and things have completely changed from uh the time that they re that they were able to to accomplish their american dream their california dream it s no longer the same and it gets to a point where you just get angry you re angry enough um where you want to do something about it and that s where i was that s where i was back in 2018 uh you know people usually say that it takes two years to run for uh the state senate seat i was jumping in january uh you know a couple months before the primary with you know a full uh list of candidates already running out for that seattle both on the democratic side and then of course the incumbent so what were you doing just prior to i guess running for election in 2018 i was you re doing organizing with uh on health health access and also uh for the teachers union here locally and uh that s my background i know how to organize union organizer and uh it took a big interest as well in in health care and and organizing around that and it s something that i still continue to champion now in the state senate yeah i think i remember your election was one of those first elections where election night the results looked one way and then we woke up the next day and it was totally different can you kind of bring us back to that point in 2018 in that race and i guess how you felt election night and kind of kind of waking up the next day to you know seeing that you d won soundly against a an incumbent yeah i look i when i got into this race i knew that the that i had a long shot i didn t have any money i i wasn t like i wasn t the incumbent i wasn t all connected uh to to the point where you know i was going to be able to have all these funding your funding available to be you know to run an effective uh and successful campaign for senate but i had the drive i had the motivation and and i worked hard i worked and knocked on doors in every community of this of the senate district i didn t knock on every door uh there s there s way too many but i did knock on a lot of doors in each community um both in the primary in the primary in the general election and uh and the one thing that my consultant kept on telling me was just just look uh just it s all about turnout if you uh are able to we have high turnout you re gonna win and uh don t worry about it and so the other thing that i i also heard from uh was it uh amanda rentery at that time she gave me a call like a few days probably before the election and she said melissa whatever you do just don t give up don t say okay i i know that i lost because you know kings county is probably going to come in and the problem kings county is probably not going to be overwhelmingly in support of you but just you know hold on and just see what the results are and so the night of the election i was walking and knocking on doors up until the last minute doing you know get out the vote efforts and what i saw was just i saw a lot of people turning out and i knew then at 8 pm i knew at 8 pm that that i was going to win this this this race uh and you know also just it was interesting because then you know once the results started kind of coming in it didn t look so good i was behind but that s because of what you know mandaria amanda and tria had said at that time she said kings county will come in first it s not going to look good and that s exactly what happened but i knew in my heart uh that this was a winning situation whether i actually lost or if i want i i knew that i wanted to um move a message forward about the community that i live in and and i felt that i was doing that so i know i had individuals coming up to me at you know 10 30 p m saying oh i m sorry you know you ran a good race and people will uh remember you from uh from this campaign and and you could run in four years and i was at peace um regardless of whatever the actual outcome was and and and sure enough by like midnight i was ahead so it i started receiving calls about one in the morning and people were like oh my god melissa you won and they were in shock and i said well you know let s there s still we still have to make sure that the results fully come in and we waited a couple of days before we actually uh declared victory yeah so i guess you ve been up here now three three years you re going into i guess your first re election i guess how are you are you approaching this re election campaign any differently are you going to kind of go in with the same mentality you did in 2018 same mentality i mean just focused on the senate district that i represent the people that i represent uh working hard day and night to find solutions to the problems that not only the central valley faces but that really california is facing in and uh i think you know being focused i i m trying to do more and conveying the message of you know what it is what the central valley is like because i just think there s there s there s a lot of uh misunderstanding or perceptions about what the valley the central valley is and you know the central valley is connected to every part of this state in many ways we just need to bring that more to light and and realize how interconnected we are as as a state and kind of now that you re back in the district right now at this legislative recess what are some of your consensuals saying what are the some of the big problems they re seeing right now uh in your district well you know they they re very thankful for the work that i m doing in sacramento and um that but particularly the biggest concern is the drought water water is an issue here for us and you know we ve been dealing with it for a very long time but this year has been pretty bad we have land that is being followed we have communities that have been going without water that have had bottled water come in i mean that s that s part of the whole reason why i decided to run for state senate because i i witnessed firsthand communities um going without water i ve witnessed firsthand how um the the impacts of contaminated water in our system this is something that we grew up knowing about and talking about but really didn t become an issue it didn t we didn t really look at it until uh 2019 at least for my knowledge i know that there was a lot of work already being done in terms of you know putting together sb 200 but um it s something that we finally were able to take action on in 2019 so it s it s you know the drought when we talk about water there s there s so many impacts that it s not just the central valley and i tell this to my team all the time and to others this is a food security issue this is a water security issue uh and you know this is an issue of public health and our own health because what we re also seeing is a lot more you know pathogens and and water that are creating you know potentially deadly you know illnesses and individuals so water and the health of our water is so important to mankind no definitely uh you know right right now we re in the last few days of bill s signing kind of here in 2020 you know all members were limited to 12 bills kind of how did you do this year in 2020 and you know do you have anything you know signed by the governor or sitting on his desk right now yeah i mean we have um i kind of lost track here but we we have we had a couple of bills signed already i think there was one that was signed to today sb609 uh which really looks to um looks to the calfresh program and allows a it s it s just it s such a great program but it the calfresh program um if if you qualify you could enter the program so it s it s a workforce program as well and it has wrap pretty much like wrap around services and uh and i believe even as if a year ago um if you re busy if you re an employer you could also get credit uh tax tax incentives to hire someone from within the program so it s a great benefit although all the way around that was signed today and yesterday we have senate bill 393 signed here in fresno with the governor which looks to make sure that there that um your migrant families don t lose access to to child care and and and so that was that was a great event yesterday and of course great bill that will help a lot of uh farm workers and their families and their and their children so we have a couple a couple of bills signed already we re looking i think still waiting on a few others we have the orphaned wells bill that is looking to get additional information of where uh well you know where these uh wells are located and and uh in order to make sure that we have uh that we re plugging them uh if they re not being uh used so we re waiting on on the signature for that one as well you know this year was a kind of a record surplus budget year a lot of money was able to go to a lot of different communities kind of what were some of the things that you advocated for in this year s budget for your district water the big thing i i would say the big success or big win that we had this year was getting funding for the you know for my essentially senate bill 559 which looks to repair the existing water conveyance systems that just need fixing it so you know we talk about water conservation this fixing these canals is water conservation because we re losing water water that is needed for communities for people for people for our own health for uh and and for you know for food and we we had the governor initially had started off with a 200 million dollar down payment and uh and right now it s at a it was a hundred million dollars so we re we re thankful for the governor and putting money into into these projects because we need we need to be able to move uh water around the state of california we need to do it in a way that um that is efficient right you know it s funny you were talking about how you know this water and the central value issues been going back a long long time i remember you know back in 2008 uh 2009 driving through the valley and they had all these signs the farmers are always great at creating these big signs about what they re thinking and there was like the congress created water crisis uh things like that uh you know we still have those exactly they re maybe a little bit faded uh you know and kind of driving up and down you know you can see you know the politics of the valley is is you know on both sides of the aisle here what what are some of the things that you re looking forward to do i guess i guess next session to kind of help i guess bring water further well really it s about building the bridge right uh i i know that there s we have these signs up and down the central valley and and really it s about making sure that sacramento that my colleagues that californians not just uh not just in the central valley but outside of the central valley know the impacts that that water will have or the lack of water will have on all californians and you know i really see this as a national security issue and uh and so i ll continue to be focused in on you know in and around that and it s really under the umbrella of of the human security theme and so human security is a relatively uh new concept but it s one that is focused on on on basically figuring out what our issues are and trying to solve them rather than um that that are grounded on our on local on local realities and so i really want to make sure that the people all across the state of california know how lack of water is is a human it s a human issue but it s also it s a threat to human security uh to our well being to our livelihoods and and uh and one of the one of the things that i always say is that when we talk about climate change i think that we we we talk about it um in many other in many ways but the one way that we that we don t talk about it is how does how can we do better to improv how do we adapt how do we adapt because um obviously there s things that we can do that we need to do to make sure that we that we stop uh the situation from getting worse but what do we do to make sure that along the way we re protecting you know humans uh from from the impacts of climate change and so that s i could you know ask for a select committee uh on human security and i ll be doing a hearing uh this fall on on on my first hearing will be on the water uh and and the impacts that water has on on our human security and so that s that s a lot of the work of you know what i m trying to do and making sure that uh that we continue to focus on water but really bringing about the issues and making sure that we re seeing how they all overlap that it s not just a water more water for ag down in the central valley no this is a food security issue this is a health issue and you ll see some of my legislation uh in next year that will focus in on that and i guess you know are there like a few solutions like big ticket items that you think could help i guess add water security for you know the state and the central valley well i think that we need to be focused we need to first fix and update our outdated infrastructure system or canals uh obviously there s there s subsidence that is happening that is uh allowing water to to escape and creating more of a water shortage um i think that we really need to also uh think about water in the next five to ten years uh and and and the threats to to water security and making sure that uh that that water stays here in the state of california that we continue to have enough water to not for you know for people um and maybe it s a little bit more work on sequa maybe it s a little bit more work on sql exemptions i i should say sql exemptions and or just figuring out how else we can create more clean water for the state of california and this system was created at the time for a population of 19 million where a population you know 40 million there s there s only so much that 40 million people can conserve that s just the bottom line so how are we going to get more water coming into the state of california we got to figure that out and i don t know if that s a storage you know underground storage water system if it s whatever i think it s all hands on deck i still uh haven t figured out exactly what what the solution is but i think that part of having that first hearing on your water security uh is is extremely important and bringing in some of some experts that have expertise on that in that area okay yeah that was going to be my next question is is you know is your select committee going to help you i guess derive a solution or at least kind of reach one i mean that s that s the goal i mean water is complicated right there s there s a famous saying that um that you know i think it goes along the lines of waters waters for fighting and whiskeys for drinking or something along those lines but you know the react and that s it s it is complicated but we really need to start coming together to figure out the solution because all of our lives are going to be are already being impacted and are going to continue to be impacted if we don t work together to come up with a solution and uh there s there s we have a lot of uh talent in the state of california we need to be tapping into every um every bit of talent that we have so that we can come up with an adequate solution that is not only going to help and save my and you know people here in the state of california but it s going to just save mankind for the entire world because this is an issue that water shortages and and and just less water is something that is occurring all around the world not just in the state of california no definitely um you know you you ve been appointed to the latino leadership committee can you kind of tell us a little bit about that appointment and kind of your role in the committee yeah so back in july of 2020 i got an unexpected call from the biden team campaign and i was asked to join the latino committee the national latino committee and i said yeah sure i i ll do whatever to help vice president joe biden and because i ve just been a big fan i ve been a big fan from uh the moment he from the time he was back as vice president uh under obama and so i said yeah sign me up what do i need to do and so sure enough uh i i didn t know exactly what that meant but as you know kind of the days went on i learned that there were about 45 uh individuals across us across the the nation that were part of this latino committee that included uh six of us here in the state of california and and uh i was the only legislator uh representing in the in that national latino committee along with a couple of governors and and uh senators uh and uh across the nation so it was uh it was really just coming together with putting putting together the latino agenda for uh for the biting campaign and really what the what the needs of the latino community are and how we were looking to find solutions to address them and so uh we put together a kind of like a policy propo policy proposal that that included topics on everything from education to health care to jobs and and a lot of that is is what is kind of being implemented to a certain to a certain extent through the white house at the moment no that s cool you guys have you guys met uh recently or any plans to meet in the future uh i mean we state there s there s a few that stay in touch and uh i know that the most recent call i had was with a state senator the former i think at this time a former state senator out of florida i believe uh he s go if i believe he s already been appointed to a position uh but i m not exactly sure if he s been confirmed or not or where right his appointment processes okay so and so i i guess you know now is kind of when when you re coming up with your big ideas obviously you already have some thoughts of what you want to do on water kind of what what s some of the other i guess areas or builds you have planned for for next legislative session well going kind of touching again once on human security i really want to focus on one health that and in one health i m not sure how familiar you are with the topic or if you ve heard of it but one health is also a concept fairly new that focuses on how human health animal health and environmental health are all interconnected and so if we really want to solve or figure out how to get out of this pandemic we really need to figure out the impacts that you know the environment and and uh and and that animals and humans how they re all intertwined and the role that they play so uh we touched on that a little bit this this year through senate bill 453 which was signed i believe last week and that bill essentially what it what it looks to do is to allow you know research on zoonotic research at csu campuses and allocate some funding for it and so it s such a big thing uh personally i think you know i think it s something like sixty percent of emerging uh diseases are come from jump from animal to human right and so we ve all learned as we ve all learned exactly as we all learned and and if we really want to um change that if we really want to address i mean look it s going to become more and more of an issue and it already has been an issue we just haven t really seen how it s all kind of interconnected and tied together and so if we really want to look at the future or prevent the next pandemic we really have to start looking and doing more zoonotic research and so i think that we need to be doing that at all levels of the education system and currently a lot of the research is focused to uc s and so this bill is is great because it just it looks into the diseases that are found in in animals that could spread to humans but really diseases on animals and diseases on crops that they re also a it s also a food security issue because you have a disease that s found on a crop it could essentially take out the entire crop and of course that we don t need that right in this time when our food supply chain is unstable and and so we need to make sure that we we prevent diseases and outbreaks on on on crops on animals because at the end of the day they all have an impact on humans uh and once again i think that s that s how it all ties into human security and and one health is is an area where i plan it to continue to focus on and quite frankly there s there hasn t been a lot of focus in on agriculture and and just the world that agriculture plays in in in our everyday lives and so i m really excited at the work that we ve that we ve done so far and really excited about the work that we ll continue to do in this area yeah i guess we don t really ponder it until we re directly confronted with it and as we have been in the past year and a half uh we ve had to deal with a lot of that right definitely merits i guess for those of us interested in i guess following your select committee can you give us a little more information about when you guys are going to be meeting and who s on the committee yeah so on the committee is as senator ben allen senator ben wesso and senator melendez melendez and and myself and we re looking to have our first hearing uh sometime in november but we re still going through the approval process to make sure that that we that would get a confirmed date so uh just stay tuned to all those listening and because we re looking to have one in in november so i you know it s it s a very interesting and fascinating area but i also encourage if those that are listening in that if they want to hear a little bit more about this this this area of interest of mine i encourage them to go to my website we did a virtual town hall at the beginning of the year and a lot of good information was was you know kind of put out there to talk a little bit more about zoonotic you know research and the role that it placed in in health and the role that it plays on our everyday lives oh definitely definitely check that out well senator hurtado thank you so much for joining us and it was very informative and uh hopefully we can catch up with you sometime next year to kind of see how your select committee is doing and kind of the things you re working on anytime thanks again all

administration his new book is called dignity in a digital age please welcome congressman ro khanna cheers and applause band playing cheers and applause band playing stephen congressman thanks for being here the book is dignity in a digital age and we ll get to that in just one moment you have been writing since you were in your teens getting published too i might add here is you you schooled george h w bush in the leadup to the first gulf war let me read a couple of these clips here that we re in a letter that you sent to the bucs county pennsylvania courier times my grandfather spent four years in jail alongside gandhi your comments about white construction helping colonialism is dead on and influenced me to care about peace and human rights and i was opposed to going to war for material reasons stephen you re 14 year you say with animosity between iraq and the united states escalating the chance of war occurring increases as each day passes you go on to say this is a war that will be brought on because of a materialistic society that evaluates only on the economic aspect go on to say every soldier s life has a priceless minority value we should demand full support economically and militarily from all nations and must have no doubts in engaging in war the 14 year old has a clear yea about armed intervention you re on armed services right given the russian buildup on the ukrainian border we re 30 years later facing another potential war what should the united states strategy be first there is absolutely no justification for putin to invade ukraine and we have to be clear about that second we want to exhaust all diplomatic options and i think we have sometime hopefully because i don t think putin is likely to go in during the olympics especially because of his relationship with china so the president made it clear that there will be tough financial sanctions but he ought to have diplomatic solution and actually ukraine s own president is calling for calm and i hope he and secretary blinken will exhaust the diplomatic solutions and i think they can avoid war we have to avoid war applause i hope you re right your district is home to apple intel and yahoo and your new book dignity in a digital age is about how to make tech work for all of us first question and i need this mean this semiseriously what is the internet what has it become as opposed to what its intention was the simple questions are the hardest here is how i would define it it s a network of computers connected that allow us to communicate share ideas in a virtual space stephen i ve always thought of it as an agreement between these computers as to how we will communicate with each other and that the problem now certainly in terms of privacy is that some of us are being harvested without our knowledge so no communication is given to us about the knowledge that is taken from us the agreement is one sided i completely agree i mean and it s compromising your freedom i mean think about it these people who are running these big tech companies can know what you re going to purchase they may even be able to know what you re going to think they may know what you re next going to do based upon your data and they can take your data and get you political candidates that you don t support even tim cook has a commencement address where he says freedom to be human is contingent on respect for privacy stephen is privacy necessary for dignity absolutely how can you have a freedom to think a freedom to be free a freedom to make mistakes if i ve hi single thing you re doing is being collected you know what they do they collect this information and target the most vulnerable i mean q anon grew because facebook and other platforms inteksly targeted other people with conspiracy theories and let to their growth instagram for teenagers like your worst experience at junior high magnified and it s leading to teenagers are serious teenagers have depression are committing soup side they know what s going on and they can stop it they don t have to have everyone liking everything and sharing everything you don t come on the show and spew misinformation think about if you spent your hour telling lies to the country while why don t you do it it s not because you fear being sued it s not because you fear political repercussions it s because you have some sense that beyond the comedy and the ratings you have something you want to do public good why should it be different for social media maybe you don t stephen i m checking with my producer that is why we do it applause laughter you write the dirty secret in silicon valley is congress will hold a hearing but nothing changes you want to create an internet bill of rights what are the top three things that have to be in the bill to make a difference the biggest thing is before someone can collect your data you need to say yes you can take the data stephen so the default is

seeing around the country is already the groundwork being laid to essentially have a coup so a redistricting frenzy is underway across the country it is map makers and politicians picking their voters rather than the other way around fewer people are aligning with the gop s platform and so in order for them to hold on to power they re going to cheat it wouldn t have to be a violent cool it would be a coup by legislative process music over the past 10 years texas gained about 4 million people in total population 95 of that population was people of color despite people of color fueling the growth over the past decade there were no new majority minority districts drawn in either the state senate the state house or the congressional map and in fact both committees made an effort to reduce the number of majority minority districts on all three levels there was a particular attention to a district just north of austin in a county called bell county that is home to a sizable black population and in this county we had two districts placed within its boundaries that looked like a donut there was the outer ring district and then there was the inner district that basically worked to cut up the population of the two biggest cities within that county basically ensuring that people of color in that county could not elect candidates of their choice some of the worst districts were in the greater houston area and into the houston suburbs and fort bend county in particular congressional district 7 take part of populations in harris county and then also cut up the aapi communities that have grown tremendously there over the past 10 years because of these maps that don t accurately reflect texans and their values we get a legislature that is passing laws that are not favorable with the people of texas and this includes senate bill 8 known as the texas heartbeat law bans almost all abortions in the state the texas bill is unique permitting almost anyone to sue any person or provider who may have helped someone get an abortion after the limit north carolina is really a true 50 50 state roy cooper who s our democratic governor won reelection by 51 the same election where trump won the state really all the statewide elections you see are right down the line we would hopefully expect that our state you know politics that our congressional members would reflect that but but they don t because of because of gerrymandering in the maps that just got passed the communities that are being targeted to dilute their representation are all urban communities they re all the places where communities of color are you know they re taking places like greensboro it s a growing town it s our third largest city has a very large historical black population that city is basically being scooped out of its county and paired with really rural mountain counties that are very far away have very different interests and are demographically very different even if democrats are winning more than 50 percent of the votes they re still ending up in the minority in our state legislature and our state legislature is deciding all these really impactful things i mean we re still one of the few states that hasn t expanded medicaid it s something that the vast majority of north carolinians want it would give health coverage to 500 600 000 people in our state who really really need it there s this just huge mismatch between what the people of the state actually want what they ve actually voted for and what they get georgia has 14 congressional districts and under the map that was passed republicans have between nine and ten of those seats which is really remarkable in a state that is one of the quintessential battlegrounds right now georgia is very much a 50 50 state almost evenly down the line what we saw last decade is the emergence of an increasingly diverse multi racial georgia tech gwinnett county for example which is in the suburbs of atlanta you know in 1990 gwinnett county was 90 white it s only 30 white today and yet that is not at all being recognized in the maps that the georgia legislature passed in the atlanta suburbs michelle al is the first chinese american woman elected to the georgia state senate her district is about 62 percent non white and in redistricting it s transformed to a district that s 52 percent white it goes from being a biden district to a trump district in ohio on the congressional map there are 15 congressional districts republicans are favored to win 12 of those in any given year democrats only three which is wildly skewed in fact you know that s about 80 percent of seats in a state where republicans at most win about 53 percent of the vote music we have reintroduced hr4 the john robert lewis voting rights advancement act hr4 will create a new coverage formula to determine which states have been the most egregious actors and subject them to pre clearance that is based on a current evidence of voter discrimination the freedom to vote act will improve access to the ballot by setting national standards for absentee voting early voting and in person voting this bill will end partisan gerrymandering

episode of sac town talks today we have matt haney joining us candidate for the 17th assembly district matt how s it going and thanks for joining us it s going well thanks for having me i am so you re currently uh running for the 17th assembly district which used to be i guess you know kind of uh uh vacated by david chu can you kind of tell us about kind of your decision to run run for assembly and kind of what you re currently doing sure absolutely uh well we re one week out from the primary so fast special elections that came about because of a vacancy there was some political uh shuffling here and different appointments and such that led to it opening up uh you know i m born and raised in the bay area raised by a single mom i went to public schools i went to public child care i went to public university at uc berkeley and i ve really had you know incredible opportunities that have come from investments that our state has made but we have a lot of big challenges that we still face as a state and as a city i represent downtown san francisco currently which includes the tenderloin and south of market we have thousands of people that are still living on our streets uh people who are unable to access health care or treatment for mental illness we have a housing affordability crisis in san francisco that i know extends all over the state where housing is too expensive for most folks and we aren t building enough housing and so all of these things are things that i ve confronted at the local level with solutions on those issues as well as economic inequality and clean energy but san francisco even a city of our size and our wealth can t solve these problems alone you know we really need much bigger bolder statewide solutions that get us to net zero emissions that build housing in every community so there s enough for people especially young people to be able to get housing uh and and invest in the future and uh and make sure that we re investing in critical public institutions like our public schools that are still underfunded um so that s why i want to go to sacramento i ve i ve spent my whole career in public service i ve represented people who are facing evictions i chair our budget and finance committee here in san francisco i ve worked in sacramento as a legislative aide and run statewide advocacy organizations and uh and i and also i like sacramento i like the people there i like the work that gets done there i like the city uh and i m excited to be able to spend more time there and and take on some of these big challenges we re facing you know it s so interesting because a lot of the folks who are you know elected to the board of supervisors or over here to sacramento from san francisco are never born and raised in san francisco they re always from the east coast ivy league educated coming back to you know coming to san francisco you know this you know one of the first kind of homegrown candidates we ve heard from in a long time can you kind of talk about you know being a local and kind of growing up there and and kind of what that means to you know your constituency sure you know san francisco is a place that welcomes people from from all over the world and and so we do have a lot of people who who end up in san francisco for a whole variety of reasons including in our leadership but i ve always been a barrier a person a barrier kid you know i lifelong giants niners warriors fans i actually represent the giants and the warriors currently they re in my supervisor district so that s uh that s an honor uh uh you know itself as a bay area kid but uh you know the bay area is an amazing place san francisco is an amazing place my grandparents still live here they re 93 and 92 they ve been here my whole life wow the place that really has such incredible creativity and innovation and love of diversity and uh you know and it s been it s been at the forefront of so many changes over the years on civil rights on lgbt rights and so you know to be able to be from here and represent this place and also bring the voice of of people from the bay area you know to sacramento uh as i said you know i ve been here and have benefited from so many opportunities as many have in our public schools and our in our public universities and so uh i do think that being a san franciscan a bay area person and representing the city is a special honor for me and i hope it gives me i i hope i can come with some level of understanding of what people here care about and what they go through and what their needs are yeah kind of you you mentioned earlier that i guess you uh graduated you know you went to public school you went to berkeley can you kind of talk about kind of your your journey from you know graduating from college kind of where you are today and kind of give us a little background sure yeah well actually you know my my first job out of college was i went and worked in sacramento i was a legislative aide for a state senator there and so i i you know a lot of the things that happen in in sacramento really are unknown to many californians you know we focus a lot more on the federal government we focus more on local government but many of the big big issues that impact our lives whether that s public education or health care universities criminal justice issues are decided in sacramento and so it really gave me that insight into how important the work is up there i spent just about a year and a half up there and then i ended up in law school and in my first year of law school i uh got caught up in uh the barack obama wave in 2008 i working for the campaign and working for him and going to the white house and leaving law school for some amount of time and that that experience also i think really taught me about uh the positive things that could come from politics you know in my my generation we had seen a lot of of the negative things you know the iraq war and different things that i we you know i was organizing against when i was in college but then we saw the barack obama campaign and for me it was a really awakening of hey you know we can actually accomplish things in politics we can get good people in there we can achieve things that maybe we didn t think were possible and so that really brought me into organizing in my own community i came back i started non profit really getting closely involved in schools working with kids raising money volunteering in schools i got my law degree in my master s in education ran a non profit that did education advocacy and then decided to run for office myself i was elected at 29 years old to the board of education here in san francisco i served for six years there including for a while as the president of the board and then ultimately you know saw the connections between the challenges that educators and families and kids were facing in our schools and what was happening in our neighborhoods in our city where people couldn t afford housing or we had over 2 000 students who are homeless we had challenges that really were bigger than what could only be accomplished in our schools which obviously is still very important so i decided to run for the board of supervisors and so um that journey has led me here to want to continue my path in public service and bring the things that i ve learned here uh and in the work that i ve been able to do to the state level so so you went to law school you got your law degree did you ever practice law did you ever go and get your license or work for a firm yeah i am a member of the bar i still pay my dues every every year and i have represented people who are facing evictions i ve practiced for some amount of time as a tenant attorney i taught education law at jfk law school and uh also taught at stanford and the design school there so i i have practiced some law but i never i never went the big firm route i i did get offered a job at a big firm but decided you know my my path was going to be more in public service you know we got a lot of staff who listen and you know that s always one of the questions we always get is you know is it worth going to law school if you have a career in politics kind of what s your opinion on that uh well i still have a lot of law school debt and so it does cost a lot of money uh i really enjoyed law school you know i met a lot of good people i learned things i got exposed to opportunities i m sure it s helped me in my in my journey now as a lawmaker i don t think it s essential in order to go into public service so i i feel like for people who want to run for office or they want to go into politics sometimes because we see so many lawyers in politics we think oh i have to do that first in order to go into politics but i i don t think that s at all the case i think that uh we really need more people who are you know teachers or doctors or or sort of from other professions nurses small business owners um in order you know to get into politics as well and i think people respond well uh to people who are not lawyers because there s already a lot of us a lot of lawyers in here but you know a lot of people become lawyers like i did because i wanted to advocate for people right so it does make sense you know at the same time if you want to have it okay for people you don t have to become a lawyer first yeah well well put especially with all the debt that comes with it yeah yeah i think i m gonna be paying this off for the rest of my life you know i look at it every time i m like well just it s just the interest keeps going up you re talking away yeah so i think you said what ballots are coming out next week is that right yeah ballots are out right now so we re you know my team is here we re already working on getting the vote out and you know uh we ve identified a lot of supporters so we re now just trying to make sure that they vote and uh yeah it s pretty it s pretty uh we re in the middle of it yeah so i guess how many candidates are there and kind of how s the the campaign looking right now yeah there are there are four candidates uh and uh you know i feel good about it i m the only sitting supervisor who s running and i ve been able to really i think have a uh a track record on things that are important to people here which i i hope is still what what will determine the outcome of this and what people care the most about you know not only whether you ve talked about it but whether you ve done it and you know during the pandemic i was very visible here on a lot of big issues you know our vaccine roll out i was deeply involved in making sure we were again getting mass vaccination sites making sure we re getting homeless people off the streets into hotels during the pandemic protecting workers so you know i think all of those things uh for me are what my narrative has been which is that i m you know a progressive leader but also someone who s been proven who s been effective on and taking on big challenges and ultimately that i ll be the most prepared to do that in sacramento so so far it seems to be resonating i think we re we re in a we re in a very good uh spot to hopefully uh you know uh win in the in either the special primary or in a runoff right so i so you have the primary now and then let you know there is a chance you get what 50 plus one vote and then you could be in right away but if not that would be like a top two runoff sometime what later what maybe june yeah april 19th will be the top two runoff okay wow everyone expects that there will be a top two runoff it s just you know there s a few strong candidates so the idea that somebody would get over 50 is is pretty unlikely i mean it s possible right but uh it s unlikely and so what what s the final election date then for this election uh the final election date for this election is april 19th is the general election runoff uh the other the primary is on uh february 15th right so okay so wow only what seven more days uh wow seven more days yeah after we finish here i gotta i gotta jump back on the phone and call people for money that s what candidates uh have to do and unfortunately the other side of the story yeah so how are things in san francisco i know that the pandemic has been pretty tough on it you know we see things in the news regarding crime and stuff uh you know how what is the pulse of the city right now and how san francisco bouncing back you know san francisco has been hit i think uh harder than a lot of places for for for a number of reasons you know we are a city that really does rely a lot on visitors and whether that s people who come here for big conventions like tech companies and such or people who visit uh from all around the world one of the most visited cities in the country and so we have a whole hospitality sector that relies on that we also have a lot of folks who work in offices downtown and so that that leads us to a place where most of those folks aren t coming in right now and so san francisco really in many ways during the pandemic has has been a shell of its former self and we ve taken the pandemic very seriously so we ve had some really strong regulations which i think you know has saved lives and have been a good thing but it s it s set us back economically for sure and so our you know my hope is that we are in the on the forward march now and we re not going backwards in terms of reopening our city and getting folks to come back into offices and getting tourists to come back and conventions to come back and everything and when that happens san francisco will will come back as well san francisco is a place that just has so much to offer its beauty its diversity we have so many you know leading companies uh in the world that are headquartered here so san francisco will be fine uh we do have challenges that have been exacerbated during the pandemic just like a lot of places i mean i was in sacramento and it was a similar kind of feel you know on k street and a lot of people were experiencing homelessness a lot of businesses shut down so it s going to take a little while for us to rebuild and also you know address some of the challenges that we already had like homelessness that i think have gotten worse everywhere during the pandemic yeah kind of you know as a candidate you re obviously going door to door talking to voters kind of what are on voters minds right now uh you know i think that uh you know they re worried about the the cost of housing and whether we re building enough housing that s a huge thing uh they re worried about homelessness and and crime you know they they do feel that things have gotten worse and i think in many ways that they ha it has you know exacerbated by the pandemic uh you know they see uh what they what what feels like an increase in homelessness and concerns about that and sort of whether our city is city and state are going to be able to confront those things you know they re worried about small businesses and overall quality of life which i think uh all of us are concerned about uh you know and then there s the big things that i get to talk to people in in this race about which it doesn t come up as much in a you know on a local uh situation but you know climate change is a huge concern you know the extreme weather events that we re seeing so i think that san franciscans are probably uh in line with much how much of the rest of the state is feeling right now we want to see things get back to normal but we re also concerned that on some fronts with some of the challenges we were facing before the pandemic that things have gotten worse and we really want to see the type of solutions that can confront those issues kind of you know going door to door and talking to people you got any really good memorable stories from the campaign trail right now uh any really good memorable stories um well you know i mean i i am always um trying to kind of keep the pulse of you know what s happening in our in our neighborhood i walk around the tenderloin a lot which is where i live i did get to chat with somebody the other day who um this is going to be the first election that he is able to vote in um you know we passed a law our first local election at least we we passed a law uh just a little over a year ago which now allows uh people who are on parole uh who served their time and around communities for them to be able to vote and uh that that s that s that was a really um heartwarming you know to think and this is true also for people who turn 18 or who are newly citizens or such but when you meet people who this is their first election and they get to vote and that they they re telling me they re going to cast their ballot for me that s something that s very humbling and uh so that without i had that moment just just last week chatting with a guy on the street and he was telling me how excited he was to be able to vote so it is also a reminder you know some of us have to have the have the privilege to be able to vote and um and don t uh you know and so it s also important i think um that for a lot of people it s a big deal and if we do have that privilege we should we should use it yeah kind of i guess you know being a board of supervisor is there some you know sometimes i m sure you must get frustrated that there s something you can t do your hands are tied because of of state law uh kind of what are you looking forward to coming to do in to sacramento and come change so uh kind of untie your hands and help your community yeah you know this has come up some uh you know we re dealing with like much of the state a a a crisis an epidemic related to drug addiction and drug overdoses and there have been some areas where i d really like to see the state either provide more help or in some ways like you said stop tying our hands you know people who need access to treatment uh prescriptions need to be able to have lower barriers to get those um get them enrolled in those treatments and the state in some ways makes it hard and and creates barriers for people to get enrolled in treatments that can get them off of opioids we we are in san francisco losing nearly two people a day to drug overdoses uh it s it s tripled over the last few years and across our state you know this is now what you know much more deadly even than than covet and so you know that that is something that i really want to help lead on expand treatment beds but also make sure you know the people who are out there interacting with people have the tools that they need you know whether that s certain um laws related to conservatorships and getting people who may not know that they need help into help and then reducing some of those barriers so that we can enroll people in treatments so that s something that i that i m you know i think as we as we move out of this pandemic we re gonna we really need to focus on some of these issues that are still huge um problems and have gotten worse and i think drug addiction is one of them especially with fentanyl we have a lot of big issue with fentanyl which is something that s 50 times more powerful than heroin and kill somebody with a very small amount wow you know with the election coming up you know you said there was four other candidates is that right what kind of distinguishes you from the other candidates in kind of why why do you think you know people should vote for you over the other folks um you know i i i think that things have been really hard over the last few years for for san franciscans as they have from much of the state and a lot of the voters are going to be asking where were you you know what what have you done for me lately you know were you there did you support our small businesses and help them stay afloat did you make sure that we had access to vaccine sites and testing sites did you help with the challenges around public safety or for housing and uh i ve done those things for for our residents and in a way that i think stands out in the field that when music the residents here really needed leadership i stepped up and because of that i m prepared to step up in sacramento on their behalf i know what their needs are i know what they ve been through i know how to get things done i am not running as an ideologue or someone who is gonna you know point fingers i m running as somebody who and i have a track record around it who s gonna roll up my sleeves and i think that s what you know is going to distinguish me in this race and also hopefully make me an effective assembly member in sacramento oh well well but well i know you know time is tight for you and you got to go get the campaign trail but thank you so much for joining us and if listeners want to check you out or your campaign how can we get a hold of you yeah matt haney com welcome to sign up or or send us a note and

turning to like the politics of this now kind of as as we re seeing all this kind of change like or how many like clear red seats are there how many clear blue seats are there and did they create more purple seats are we gonna see more competition here uh in the coming years and you know seeing who was elected yeah so in the last uh 30 days i ve been trying to spend more time on my bike than think about congressional districts but i think i still remember these numbers um so uh the districts that came out really were probably pretty good for democrats um uh there are two districts in particular that republicans basically had flipped into democratic seats um and that would be the valedio district in uh the central valley um that is uh you know that it s a majority minority district that comes down into bakersfield and goes north from there not the mccarthy district and then the mike garcia seat in that santa clarita one the one i was talking about where like people are calling in and saying you should be in and all backgrounds the republicans that organized that stuff they lost and that district is democratic so those should be two democratic pickup opportunities those should happen in 2022 but if republicans held on to them they should happen in 2024 but those districts are kind of off the list of republican seats basically from the metrics we could talk forever about whether or not the metrics are good there s also the michelle steel seat which is this uh little saigon seat that goes up into fullerton and it is one that i literally drew the exact district in my prep and it was a new idea for a district but it was creating a more of an asian opportunity district and uh that district is on paper democratic but um it ll be harder for democrats to win that because they don t have like a great bench there and so they re going to be you know they don t have like a sitting assembly member who can run for that they don t have a sitting state senator who s going to run for that so it s it s going to be a little more challenging also the late census data i call the late census data incumbent protection like it wasn t that s not why they did this in the census late but the late census data meant you had later redistricting which means it s like voila you ve got your lines and the person who s the incumbent has their campaign team their fundraising their their organization their endorsements their their whatever and they re ready to go and some challenger like they might have the best district in the world but you know they don t even have a campaign chair they don t have a fundraiser they don t have endorsements they don t have whatever and now the sudden you have 60 days before the you know filing deadline and you re like kind of screwed so the michelle steel seat is one that s democratic so that s basically i d say on paper republicans lost two and a half seats democrats left one seat because they lost the lowenthal seat so net gain for democrats i think in the plan overall which um from all those ensembles wasn t really supposed to happen democrats were supposed to lose one interesting so like you know you work in a lot of states you you see kind of what goes on nationally you know i guess is our model you know the best you you know in the in the understanding california is the best um we re the best at everything best weather the best at everything um i think the california process is the best process because it allows for a commission that has shown in these last two iterations to be high quality you know above reproach in terms of their kind of partisanship and that make up the the process one of the things that some people might say they don t like about the commission process is that we don t have like a strict competitiveness criteria in other states they re supposed to look at like is the number of seats that democrats and republicans going to win proportional to their share of the votes in statewide elections um we don t have that standard we have like a partisan blindfold where they re not supposed to know or care about where the partisans are and just draw districts based on the rank criteria um i like that process um i like the fact that our commission is the final say and they implement the lines as opposed to a commission that s kind of like a suggestion and it goes to the legislature and then they get to haggle over it so this true independent commission process i think is definitely the best michigan did one this year um that was basically the same process a little different um i am a little bit more skeptical of the outcome of michigan because they did had some problems in drawing of the black districts um vra issues that i just didn t think were right so um but then there s other states that have different versions of this uh but that california model i think is the best i i would love for it to be the national model there is a national bill that requires states to have commission commissions it would also have that competitiveness criteria language in it i wish they didn t but um having a commission structure nationally would be much much much better than these political footballs you know that s kind of interesting because yeah originally you think oh yeah competitive that d be good right but if it doesn t really represent the you know the local or the people then what does it matter it s kind of like one of those things where um when you have it s really really harder than people would think you need districts to all be whole pieces equal size not violate the voting rights act and then as you start to tack on more criteria it gets harder and harder to draw like perfect districts and if you say like districts have to be competitive that s great in a sense but you are going to end up subjugating the other criteria so if you were to say california map like california map isn t quote unquote competitive it s not proportional the california map california elects republicans or california voters vote on the republican side of the ticket between 35 and 38 of the time roughly in the last couple of statewide elections for you know congress and governor and president and that kind of stuff so republicans should have 35 to 38 of the districts based on the way the lines are drawn now they have like depending on which house you re looking at and what metrics you re using they have anywhere from 12 to 20 percent of the districts so we would have to take our map and then now adjust it to create more competitiveness and how would you do that like you would take democratic leaning republican districts or democratic leaning districts and like try to shove more suburban white voters in them you know like there d be a lot of things you d have to do to really distort this map to make it be a 35 percent of republicans getting elected and in fact it might be like a look like a republican gerrymander to do it so competitiveness just adding that additional additional criteria it s going to end up subjugating the other criteria and it s just in my view more harmful than good make sure you click the

county voters this makes no sense he didn t have support from his own state senators even on his own side and he s just wanting to do anything he can to sort of break up the board the board majority that s fighting for parental rights not sure what men s motives are i know for as long as i ve been aware of him he s not like the orange county board of education he really targets us and they re they re pretty mean tweets so um i don t think he s a friend of ours i think he s targeting us for his own personal political ambitions and i m very surprised by it introduces this bill he never once came and talked to us wrote a letter to us anything else is being done to us and not with us he s clearly just after us and not wanting to talk to us and trying to do this to us music applause this is lori kaler with costa mesa brief reporting on senate bill 286 this is not something that we want here in orange county who is it that gave us this bill senator david min who is david min what what do we know about him he somehow was elected to state senate defeating the term cons long term conservative john morlock with california teacher association and planned parenthood funds men does not have a california license to to practice law but he s a law professor at uc irvine min calls himself a native of california but he was born in rhode island he s not a native from orange county since he grew up in san francisco after attending law school on the east coast he worked at the security exchange commission and later as a securities litigator for a washington dc law firm min is a former staff attorney and banking committee policy advisor for u s senator and current senate majority leader chuck schumer min was an associate director for financial markets policy at center for american progress a left leaning think tank on extreme and social issues mint also introduced another legislation senate bill 264 banning firearms sales from state owned properties which was amended to apply only to the orange county fairgrounds shutting down their gun shows starting january 1st of this year joining me now are members of the orange county board of education to share their reactions to this bill president mary barkey i know that there was an article written about you previously and where you were interviewed would you please share what your reactions to this bill the author behind it and what his possible motives may be well first of all i was very surprised i only learned about the bill the day before the orange county register called me to discuss it so very surprised that it came out of nowhere and really surprised it was only targeting orange county board of education wasn t a statewide bill i understand he tried to make it a statewide bill but he couldn t get any support from his fellow senators he even had a co author when the bill started he had senator umberg i understand later removed his name so it doesn t seem like it s a very popular bill not sure what men s motives are i know for as long as i ve been aware of him he s not like the orange county board of education i have seen tweets dating back to 2020 where he really targets us and they re they re pretty mean tweets so um i don t think he s a friend of ours i think he s targeting us for his own personal political ambitions and i m very surprised by it thank you we have had elections in june 50 years ago up until the present who is this man to change the way we do elections um we have we have lisa sparks trustee alicia sparks un vice president ken williams wrote the rebuttal article which was published in the orange county register on january 18th would you please share what with us why this bill for election reform is misleading does it make does it make the process less confusing or more confusing and how would this bill impact the voters in orange county who have chosen the candidates for the last several decades well sb 286 has nothing to do with election codes as daveman is purporting to be concerned about you know he is sort of a media trying to get attention in orange county trying to make a name for himself at the expense of orange county voters and that s a problem you know the orange county board of education basically he s hovering over the target because we re getting things right we ve approved more charter schools than any other county in our 58 counties in the nation you know why would he single out orange county out of our 58 counties to change the voting election laws you know the voters put us into office because they re believing in what we re doing for parental rights and um and the you know expanding parental choice and rights expanding public charter schools for parents to be able to walk with their feet to schools that work for them you know we ve highlighted in sunshine controversial issues that the public had no idea about such as the california healthy youth act and the critical race theory that are being implemented in public schools without parental knowledge so that parents can have an idea of what to ask of their schools and districts so this senator men state senator men uh you know a uc law professor imported from wherever he was imported on the east coast not that that s a bad thing but i m just saying this makes no sense he didn t have support from his own state senators even on his own side and he s just wanting to do anything he can to sort of break up the board the board majority that s fighting for parental rights for the voters of orange county and the voters put us in office we ve been elected in in half of us have been elected in the primary in the gubernatorial year and the other half are elected in the presidential uh general election and that s been going on for more than 50 years so this just makes no sense it is indeed a crazy bill makes absolutely no sense thank you lisa sparks and trustee tim shaw as a father of five boys i know that you as well as these other trustees care about the children and their parents who desire the best interest for their children for their academics their innocence how would this bill possibly impact the families in orange county and please share any other thoughts about this bill or about this author that you have well thank you yeah it s actually father of six boys i apologize we added one four years ago so well the the bill i mean the fact that he he s not applying it to other counties kind of speaks to probably his motives if this was a good idea why isn t it being done in all the counties he only specifically made it about orange county another part that s going to be confusing to voters we elect our superintendent the superintendent s election would remain in june but the board of education members would be in november so i think that that on its face makes no sense and at any time the board could um change the election to november and i i if there was a spirit of cooperation maybe he could have written us a letter or called us up hey i have an idea why don t you guys move it to november instead he just introduces his bill he never once uh came and talked to us wrote a letter to us anything else it can be is being done to us and not with us and so i think if there was any kind of spirit of you know cooperation i i think that s the way he would have approached it but he s clearly just after us and not wanting to talk to us and trying to do this to us right it does sound very disingenuous and insincere and wonder what his motives truly are this does not sound like this is to make things easier and less confusing to me this is going to make things more confusing like you said i would just add that not only is he working closely with the union bosses of of california and probably nationwide as well since he worked for chuck schumer for god s sake um but also the the county committee that s going to approve our redistricting that we put forth a map that has zero deviation for that s aligned with the the census uh we put it forth the way we re supposed to by december 15th deadline well this county committee that is 11 people who are not elected by the voters but they re selected by school boards are going to make a decision to not approve our map five and they ve been delaying and delaying and so obviously they re working with the union bosses as well to try to do anything to break up our our board majority fighting for parental rights uh and sunshining important issues in orange county so it s just they re kind of trying to hit us at all fronts and you know we re standing tall and we re you know sunshining the truth whenever possible and thank you for giving us this opportunity to talk with you to you know let the voters know what s going on well and i wonder as well do do those that supported him are they concerned about how he s spending his time his two big pieces of legislation one was shutting down the gun show which is tremendous revenue to orange county and i know that there s been a lot of documentation that there s been no crimes from gun sales at gun shows so so you know the county lost quite a bit of revenue and then his other bill is to move an election i mean we re paying his salary the taxpayers are paying a salary and what what is his objective is he really solving the problems of orange county i don t think he is and i think he doesn t like that we are that we are very accountable to our constituents you know even during the toughest of times the last two years we ve never had a virtual meeting here at the county we are always here for the constituents and all but one meeting we ve had an audience and we give them a forum and they can always come and talk to us and we listen i i would add one thing too you know we re talking about senator minn a lot but there s a premise here that assembly members and senators from northern california central california all across the state should be deciding when the orange county board of education holds their elections it s crazy on its face if there s if there s going to be a change why wouldn t that be the elected representatives in orange county or the voters in orange county why are we asking a state senator from chico or san francisco or wherever to make this decision it s it s completely violating the whole idea of local control and letting us decide you know what we want to do in our county and other counties that have the same election none of their senators would author the bill with him and that says something too that they didn t feel that there was an appetite for that or a need for it so and speaking of how he s hurting orange county with that other bill that you were talking about that uh that the gun show can t be held at the state fairgrounds across the state but he singled out orange county and what i understand is it s a million dollar loss every year and so now a lot of the constituents are saying well we re just going to avoid any anything at the county fairgrounds given that this is the case so we re going to lose even more millions of dollars you know with that that single decision so what is senate bill 286 uh this is a if it passed would change election cycles of the members of the orange county board of education from the june primary elections to the november general elections why is this an a problem it s a problem because we ve been singled out why only orange county it s very concerning that one county board of education was singled out is because we re such an effective county board of education is it because we re so pro parental rights and we protect parental rights every day yes and it s a fundamental change in voting for the orange county department of education leadership positions producing the exact problem that men says he wants to correct that is bringing about more confusion and greater voter disenfranchisement right the problem and i believe that you tim shaw brought up the other issue about the superintendent as well would you just reiterate sure so we elect our superintendent county wide and that would remain in the june election what his bill is trying to do is only move the five trustees on the board of education to the november election so if you re a voter you would go in in june and vote for the superintendent and then november a few months later have to make a separate decision for the board member that would represent you so it would it would it doesn t make sense why wouldn t we be on the ballot together and one thing in reading his arguments about why this is a good bill i was somewhat offended that he s talking about different groups of people who just apparently can t be bothered to vote in the june election they only somehow vote in the november election it s very insulting to people that you know well these people can t be bothered to vote twice in the same year so they only vote in november so we need to uh move this election to november how profoundly insulting of course a voter is able to vote in june and november they re they re not so stupid and it it just really talks down to to the voters and i i really was offended in reading his his argument so the orange county register article that you were interviewed in mary says members of orange county school board could face bigger more liberal electorate very interesting that it was actually the orange county register that brought that out i didn t even mention that so here a newspaper is is looking at his bill saying wow this is really a political grab for the democratic party and it is rather insulting to the voters it brings about voter disenfranchisement so we ve got this ivory tower uc law professor okay saying oh voters you know you don t know what you re doing you don t know how to vote let me let me show you how to vote in the november election very insulting i agree yes i think the motive is what s concerning is what he s trying to accomplish my response to uh the register was i d actually campaign the same way i m not going to campaign any differently i believe in getting out there and touching the voter and if you touch the voter and you remind him what we re doing and how much we care about children and families rather than the union who holds a lot of board seats that don t really work for the families thank you so much for coming and i know that you

to another episode of sac town talks today we re joined by assemblywoman akilah weber joining us akilah how s it going thanks for joining us i m good how are you thank you so much for having me very well very well thank you you know because the coved you know a lot of us haven t you know got to know you or kind of hear your story uh you know we all know your mother and you know she was on the the show in 2020 and she s you know always great to have uh so can you you know for those who don t know can you kind of give us a little bit about your background and kind of what brought you to sacramento sure of course well i am a san diego native was born and raised actually in the district that i currently represent after high school i left for a very long time about 16 17 years i went to college med school residency fellowship and was working in other areas throughout the country um i moved back in 2013 because i wanted to start to give back to the community that had given so much to me i am an ob gyn board certified ob gyn i did a fellowship in pediatric and adolescent gynecology so when i moved back to san diego i founded the pediatric and adolescent gynecology division at rainy children s hospital which is the children s hospital in san diego um and i also started getting very active within my community and politically active as well i kind of grew up around politics and understood the importance of always making sure that that you know different voices were at the table and in 2018 a situation happened in my city where a young african american high school senior female was slammed to the ground by one of our police officers and at that time i decided i needed to do a little bit more and so i ran for city council in my area became the first black american to be elected to city council in my city and uh was you know doing some really important work on my local city council and still practicing so being a mommy of two amazing uh little boys um and then the pandemic hit in 2020 and that really changed a lot and so when this seat opened up i decided to run for it uh for a couple of reasons one um within the 79th assembly district we have had someone who s been a very strong advocate for the needs within our district but also just a strong advocate up and down california in general i wanted to make sure that that legacy continued but also realizing that we need to make sure that we have diversity at the table when making laws and policies and not only diversity in terms of your your race or your gender but also your background and being in the midst of a pandemic understanding that at the time in the assembly there was one physician and one physician in the senate really drove home the point that we need to make sure that we have more people in the health care field um actually in sacramento formulating the laws and legislation that not only impacts how we practice medicine but also the patients that we serve and so that s why i decided to run and uh i ve been having a good time so far wow so so back when you re on the city council you were still working and practicing as a doctor i was and um because i live in a smaller city within the district la mesa i love it um so i was able to do it because it was part time but i still practice now so when i go i go when i go home to san diego on fridays um two fridays a month have fridays i have clinic and then one half friday i m in the operating room are you delivering babies or what kind of so i m not doing the obstetric part but i am doing a surgical part okay wow yeah that s that s a lot on your plate that s amazing but it s good because it keeps you know it keeps me doing the other part that i love right there was a lot of time and and energy that i put into um becoming a physician exactly what is it is it four years of med school and then how long is the residency how long before you can actually start practicing on your own for whatever well i did four years of med school four years of residency and two years of fellowship and that was after four years of college so um and and i loved what i was doing um especially some of the specialized surgeries that i was doing so i m very happy that i was able to continue a very small portion of my practice i miss my adult patients i miss delivering babies right now but i i m so happy that i get a chance to still do my surgeries kind of growing up can you kind of tell us about i guess your family and kind of how it was kind of being raised by shirley weber so um you know i had i was very blessed with two amazing parents so uh that were both very active um in their own regards so you know everyone is very familiar with my mom she um when i was growing up was a professor at san diego state and also was on the school board i think she joined when i was like maybe at the end of my elementary year and then throughout 7th 12th she was still on sangha unified school board always very active a very powerful force within san diego community a great role model someone to look up to my father was very active as well he was a personal injury attorney and then became a administrative law judge but was very active within the naacp was past president of our local naacp was very active within the black lawyer association um was very good friends with speaker willie brown and and all of the people up here so i kind of grew up with two parents in that space and i actually honestly never thought i would go into politics which you know medicine because you see the good the bad and the ugly but what they instilled in both my brother and i was the importance of giving back um the importance of advocacy and the importance of making sure that everyone has a voice and for those who either don t use their voice or don t know how to use their voice it is your responsibility to use it for them so you know there are a lot of people that kick down a lot of doors for me to be able to get here a lot of people whose shoulders i stand on a lot of people who unfortunately died fighting for the rights that i have today and so it is my responsibility to keep those doors open to open up more doors and to make sure that we have a california that really works for everyone how has your experience been coming up to sacramento you kind of came you know in the middle of the pandemic in the middle of a session uh how has it been getting acclimated and kind of you know getting your footing here when you know everything is just i guess so new and you know evolving with uh kind of changing and and things like that it s been very very interesting um you know i a lot of people say oh well you know what to expect or you know what s going on and i m like no i i had a life in san diego i had a two jobs i had you know two boys so i wasn t necessarily focused on the inner workings of sacramento but um you know i really appreciate my other assembly members my other simply colleagues they they were very warm and welcoming um i did come in in april which was actually after the the um the deadline to submit bills but two of my colleagues did give me um one each of their bills so that i was able to carry some some bills last year um and they ve just been you know very good if i ve had any questions now we re still in a pandemic so still kind of doing this like meeting people via zoom ish which is you know different for sacramento but um but it s been good so far yeah you know it s interesting talking to all the the members about the new swing space kind of what are your thoughts and how are you enjoying your new your new office you know i like it so you know if you talk to people i know if you talk to people who have been here for a while they don t like it i even um so you can t see but like right across the street is the secretary of state s office right so i know right so my mom came over and she was like oh you know and a lot of people who were over there longer are like oh but i actually like it i um i love sun i love light um i love windows this place is a lot i think overall for everyone s well being just healthier because there s just so much sunlight um that i i actually like it i m i m i m happy here that s funny we were talking to miyabanta yesterday and she she felt the same thing i was like oh yeah it s open it s new it s it s great so yeah it seems like the new members are like in the space more than the older ones it s funny yeah if you had spoken to me in the old space you wouldn t be seeing this light back here you know i didn t have any windows in my office and um you know i i understand the importance of light and sunlight i went to med school in rochester new york where it was gray for like half the year um so you know it s important to have your sunlight you know so i guess is this i guess you know the beginning of the year the governor comes out with with his budget kind of what are your some of your thoughts on the on the budget kind of what are some of the things that i guess you d like to see prioritize more well you know we um are still in the midst of a pandemic and so i was very happy to see that that there are still money and resources being allocated to make sure that we have testing sites that we are still continuing with education and that if we need to ramp up again within the hospital system that we will have the ability to do that um and so that you know for me because that right now is kind of on the forefront of my mind and hopefully most people s mind to make sure that we are able to get through this and hopefully stay out of it but if we end up having to go back that we re ready to go back um you know the other issue that was very important and again done with covet had to do with sick leave um and so that had expired um back in september unfortunately we weren t able to get something done in the last legislative session um and so i was very happy that we were able to do that this time so with his um initial budget priorities and the initial things that we voted on um i ve been very happy with with the things that we ve been able to focus on yeah so i guess we just had the big deadline for bill introduction kind of what are some of the things you re working on and i guess how many bills did you end up with so um as of right now i have about 14 or 15 bills um and um and i m actually really really happy with my bill package it s very um i like to say diverse um kind of touch on some some big priorities but also some things that came out of the district so like i said you know we re still in the midst of this pandemic and um one of the things that s important to me not only as a physician but you know as a mom with kids in school is that we are able to keep all californians hate healthy and safe um that we re able to keep our schools open and our businesses um thriving and so there are a group of us um that people affectionately call the vax caucus or the vaccine caucus oh really yeah and um and so with us we have introduced eight bills so far dealing with vaccines um or around coveted in general and so my the bill that i am um pushing out from that uh caucus is ab1797 which deals with updating the california immunization registry and what this would do is um one gives schools the ability to have you know access to the immunization registry the california immunization registry they do have limited access at this point but only can really only report on those um vaccines that are required um and so you know it s hard right now for them to to say who s been vaccinated with coveted vaccine or not because that s not a required vaccine at this point um and it also requires physicians that give out vaccines to make sure that they re putting this information into the vaccine registry and then the other thing the bill does which is very important is that as you re putting the information into the vaccine registry you also input the race and ethnicity unless the particular patient or parent opts out and the reason why this is so important is because we know about health disparities we know about um issues as far as who s getting immunizations and who s who is not and so this is actual data to prove that there are some disparities there or there aren t and if there are disparities then we can focus our efforts and resources on those communities to help make sure that we re getting um the information to them and that we re also providing access for for those communities to become vaccinated so that s a big part a big priority for me the other priority for me is really closing the academic achievement gap that is that s that s been out there for a very long time and it s not moving and the way in which we do that is by one keeping kids in school and two making sure that we re giving resources to those that that need it the most and so i actually have two bills that i ve introduced around this one is ab2598 and what that does is that is a restorative justice bill and that basically within the california department of education would establish a baseline restorative justice practices or standardized restorative justice practices for all schools here in california and um and would require that the school districts use those first instead of the more disciplinary things that we have seen with certain um ethnic background or so some social economic background and so i m very happy about that one and then the other one is example on that one so um so for example like if someone um let s say you hit a kid right um and instead of uh suspending you or um you know taking something away from you you have a discussion about why that was wrong you as the child go and apologize to their child you hear from that other child about how that child felt by being hit um and you just have more of a it s not a discipline but it s a learning method and um and it s done it s done studies have shown that it works um that when you when you do these things in schools that you have a much lower rate of suspension you have better attendance and ultimately you have better graduation rates and you can see differences in how children are quote disciplined based on race and social economic status so this would basically be something that just says you know what this is a method that we need to instill first in all of our schools before we go to the suspension or the expulsion or the detention which are all negative factors um another thing that another bill is 2744 that looks at lcf lcff funding and what it would do is it would establish a new category to essentially provide funding to the lowest subgroup or the lowest performing subgroup of students that s not already receiving funding so right now what do we know we know that african americans are at the lower end of the achievement gap and it has been that way for a very very very long time and so since they at this time are the lowest performing uh subgroup there would be more money and more resources sent to the schools based on where you have a higher rate of african americans to implement programs and um and and things to help close that gap whether it s tutoring whether it s um you know what when i grew when i was growing up we had um mentors at the school that worked supposedly just with african american males but they ended up actually working with everybody but it really helped out as far as the academic achievement and the outcomes of our african american males and so the lcff bill would create this new subcategory to give more money more resources to hopefully close that gap that unfortunately it s just continuing to wide um so that s my stuff around education as a doctor as an ob gyn i m very much interested in reproductive health reproductive justice and access and unfortunately we are you know in a situation at this point where it is highly likely that roe versus wade will be overturned and what we re going to see here in california as a result of that is that we re going to have more people coming into our state looking for those services that they cannot receive in their states it is estimated that if roe versus wade is overturned that there will be about 26 states that in which you will not be able to receive those services and so um there is a group of us within the women s caucus that are working on a variety of different bills and my specific bill deals with funding that funding gap providing a pool of money to allow for providers to to do these procedures and get reimbursed for them whether or not the particular patient has insurance or if their insurance just refuses to pay for it um and so that is an anticipation of what we all kind of think is going to happen coming down from the supreme court um and then i ve got some local things uh you know we did a a call out in my in my community in my district to say hey what kind of bills would you like to see uh pass this upcoming year or at least introduce this upcoming year and one that was very interesting we turned into a bill 80 16 30 it s called the vulnerable defendant s right act to a fair trial and this came out of a story where there was an individual who was deemed incompetent to stand trial in one county and before competency could be re established they were arrested in another county tried and convicted and no one had even ever checked to see what happened in this other county and so this would basically mandate that one you checked to make sure that this particular person had not been deemed deemed incompetent and two had if they had been deemed incompetent that at some point competency was restored before you can take them and put them on trial and you know i m very proud of that actually came out of my district one of one of the constituents actually um suggested that and then one of the things that i did do when i first got here was i um got the other delegation san diego delegation together to do an audit of our county jails because there are a lot of deaths in san diego county jails a lot of unanswered questions and that audit was just released a couple of weeks ago and um you know unfortunately what it showed is what people had been saying for a long time san diego county jails have the highest rate of death in any county in the state and there were some glaring glaring deficiencies some glaring things that really need to be changed um our standard of how we treat our inmates especially with their their physical and mental health needs to be raised and so my office is now working on a bill to basically improve the standards statewide because one of the things that the audit brought was yes san diego county is bad but there s really no specific county in california that we can point to and say this is the one that you should be modeling yourself after there are national standards but we don t have like the golden county here and so we re working on a bill to just raise our standards to align with um national standards um you know a when you re in jail or when you re sent to prison or while you re waiting for trial because unfortunately about half of these people were just waiting for trial and died it shouldn t be a death sentence and so we need to make sure that not only in san diego county but in all 58 counties here in california if you happen to be incarcerated um that you are taking care of and that you don t die just based on people not doing what they should be doing or listening to your your physical or mental needs right you know i guess kind of touch back up on your um kind of um your your piece of legislation dealing kind of with the the roe v weight issue and a lot of people are talking about that and a lot of people are fearful about that and you kind of hear this kind of dialogue oh well we re in california like what it doesn t affect us can you kind of i guess kind of touch upon that thought and you know that s something i never thought about is that you know people will be coming here to to getting abortions and kind of what other fallouts do you see that yeah you know we um in a sense we are very fortunate here when we re dealing with roe versus wait before i move back to um california i was actually living in dallas texas and practicing in dallas texas and um you know when i was there i just saw everything that was going on even back then and i was like this state has a war against women s health and so we re very fortunate in that i don t think anyone can say that here in california but you still have the ability an insurance company can still say that we re not going to cover this and you have to come out of pocket in some rural areas you still may have to go farther than you would like to go to receive um the care in terms that you would need and so you know even here in california we can still have some improvements um and then you know when i saw that when this last not this president but the president before was elected i started talking to a lot of my colleagues um in this space and i said what are we going to do because i see this happening i see roe versus wade happening what are we going to do here in california because this is going to become a place where people come to um and they re going to need our services we re going to need to beef up in terms of the number of providers that we have that can perform certain procedures like i said we re going to need to also make sure that there s a funding source so even though we are we don t have to really worry about um it not being available here in california if we don t beef up some of these things then either one your insurance can say that it s not going to pay for it or two because we have the mass influx of people from outside you have to wait longer to get the procedure or the care that you need and so we ve got to make sure that neither one of those happens and that s why these bills and these discussions right now are so very important yeah it s fascinating it seemed like you know forever that you know roe v wade would never be overturned and they d talk about it and you re like yeah but is that really gonna happen and it just seems so surreal i know i i talking about this today i never thought i honestly never thought like 10 years ago i would have never thought that but um you know there are a lot of things that have happened over the last you know four or five years we never thought would actually happen um between 2016 and 2020 i know right um but unfortunately when you have something like roe versus wait because even like the voting rights right you know like this is something that we re talking and who would think that we re talking about voting rights who would think that we are seeing states implement modern day jim crow laws like you would think that we were past that but unfortunately i think what we re all learning is that some things that we thought were permanent and solidified really aren t and so we have to make sure that we find ways to permanently solidify a lot of these things i honestly before this had no idea that the voting rights was something that was voted on every you know so many years and then this year or this you know this last time when when it wasn t voted on it s like wait a minute what do you mean what are you talking about and um and so it s it s been it s been interesting but i think it should hopefully fire some sense of passion and once again fire and a lot of us especially our youth um to say that we ve got to always um be awake and and make sure that we re understanding what s going on and not take certain things that we think are going to be here forever for granted you know you were talking about how you were in this what is it what do you guys call the vaccine caucus is that what you guys call yourself that s what we re yeah that s what we re kind of known as it s um and we got together we started this actually during the summer recess last year because we kind of saw that there may be an uptick in covet around uh winter time but it s um myself assembly member lowe assembly member wix um senator pan senator newman and senator weiner and we ve been working on these bills and kind of you know i guess is it surprising to you seeing this kind of vaccine hesitancy and you know a lot of discussion about kids and vaccines and uh you know it kind of bewildering to me and a lot of people but you know it seems to be a major issue and kind of what do you guys expect and you know how how do you deal with this yeah well you know it s definitely unfortunate it s um you know i think that over time um there s just been a growing number of people who are just against vaccines in general but with this particular um virus and this particular vaccine it was so politicized and i in my lifetime do not remember anything like this being politicized you know whether it was the flu or ebola somewhere else like i don t remember you know it s science is science and um and so i think because it was so politicized that s why we re saying what we re seeing today i mean and i was talking to a friend earlier because i was looking at like vaccination rates from different states and um you know you can you can see the difference unfortunately in what are considered quote blue states and what are considered quote red states in terms of um the percent of facts of their population that it s vaccinated so it s that s why we re seeing it this time i mean i think that it s natural to be concerned about something new um i i admit you know when i got the vaccine i was like oh my goodness because i was practicing at the time i was doing surgeries and so the first week that it came out i had to get it and i was like oh my god oh my god but now we ve had so many people that have gotten the vaccine that um you know there have been more people that have gotten it than we ve had in any previous study or trial or anything before anything came came out that you know a lot of the the concern or the rhetoric is is completely unfounded um there was a mother at my son s school who said oh i m not going to have my daughter get the vaccine because i want her to have children in the future i was like what wait huh you know so because now there s this thought that it s going to cause infertility so um it s it s it s unfortunate it s unfortunate because it is a virus that is still very contagious and for those who are not vaccinated it is potentially so very deadly and um you know it s also a virus that you don t know once you get it what that long haul syndrome is going to be for you and you know i have my dad is from louisiana i went to school and i went to college in louisiana and i have family in louisiana that think a little different than i do and i spoke with one of my cousins a few weeks ago and found out that he had just gotten out of the hospital because he s not vaccinated and he had been in with covet for 22 days in the icu 18 of those days i see 18 of those days because he believed that the vaccine had killed someone so it s um it is it is unfortunate that it s been so politicized because it allows for all this misinformation and disinformation to get out there and just when rampant in our communities right and i guess how has it been kind of being a mom and being now an elected i guess full time elected and also working at a doctor you know how are you spending time with finding time for the family and being able to balance that yeah my oldest is ten my baby is eight and my oldest is just like whatever you know as long as you do my math with me i m fine because when dad does it with me that s when i get a c so um and my baby s like as long as you come home on thursdays and you don t leave until monday morning you know i can deal with it um but i um i make sure that i spend as much time with them when i am back in the district as possible it s baseball season i m so excited we re all so excited about that um but i also see them i call them every morning before they go to school but i also set up zones with them um every day so that i can do their homework with them and so i just copy their homework from their books i bring it up here with me um and i either go through it with them or with my son like i said i actually do the math which has been interesting i m like i m like google like did i do this right or am i i m on my calculator like did i do this decimal fraction thing right um you know just to make sure that there s still that connection and also academically that they re not going to be like you know falling behind or anything like that but but we re making it work i make dinner for the week on sundays for them so they because they don t like their father s cooking so i made dinner for them throughout the week are they eating out behind your back well i i check when i get back how much of this food have you guys eaten um because yeah i didn t want them end up eating out or just skipping meals and you know their uniforms and stuff are ready for them for the week so i do as much as i can over the weekend to make sure that their week is you know seamless and smooth and then on the weekends i spend as much time with them as i can and i take them to different events they don t like it but you know what i had to do it when i was younger and i turned out okay so that s too funny and you get do you see your mom often up here in sacramento or she up and down the state pretty frequently she s up and down the state um i actually stay at her place uh so when she happens to be in town i see her but i will usually see her at least one day on the weekends because she wants to see her grandkids right so i ll take him over there that s awesome well it sounds like you know you re going to be busy this year yeah i m excited yeah a lot of exciting stuff it should be interesting to see uh how you guys uh you know take it on and uh you know thank you for your work and especially taking on that vaccine issue you know that s always a bear yes i know trust me music social media has shown me how challenging that is exactly exactly so yeah you re gonna you re gonna have your hands full with that but best of luck to you this session and uh excited to see how it goes and hopefully we can touch base with you later in the year to see how everything went definitely thank you so much for this i enjoyed it great talking with you all right bye music oh music,"police,roe

cities doing coming out of covet 19 you know i guess the rental assistance is going to i guess expire this month so i guess kind of heading into the end of the year and into next year are are they recovering nicely or kind of do you see i guess problems no definitely a lot of problems um i think like i said my communities i depend on the small businesses so we re trying to make the small businesses you know whole again um either through legislation through assistance for them and i think the number one priority is to get everybody back to work after the the moratorium ends i hope not but i believe that there s going to be an influx of folks losing their their their homes their apartments and i think the way we we can head that off is by making sure that everybody s back at work and so there is that you know folks are uh trying to do the right thing right and make sure that that we re open for business but i think a lot of our community members and i m going to say it um you know believe that um they have this idea about the vaccine um you know for whatever reason that it they re not going to take it so i think the challenge is for us right now is make making sure everybody s vaccinated um so that we that um you know the the local eateries are are comfortable opening because you know you don t infect everybody and but again we have different challenges i represent a community that s more moderate and so i hear a lot of the rhetoric and you know just to be honest with you it s not even the the more red um cities in my area that that have that that belief about the covid and about the vaccine some of my local communities mainly and i and it s uh interesting to me mainly a lot of the older um uh latino women are like no you know they tell me that they you know the misinformation is as being passed along so one lady said she said that uh you know that she s not taking the vaccine because there s a tracker in it and so i i you know instead of i was baffled right but but i i said you know with respect in spanish i said um if they re tracking you like what did you do that you re afraid of being tracked you know and she was like obviously no answer because they re listening to this rhetoric and i said and and if they tracked you what would you be doing i said because they can track me and i can tell you i go to work i pick up the kids drop the kids off at school go to work pick them up go to you know to do my my jobs i said so if they tracked me they would track me you know back and forth from home to work and so i don t know you know what we re afraid of about being tracked because our cell phones track us 100 of the time so so she she didn t quite understand that they re it s interesting there there s two mind frames right so she s talking about the being tracked and when i was trying to be logical about the fear of being tracked um she didn t really have an answer and then so of course i you know i stopped and then you know throughout my conversations with other community members you know some of that information comes comes up and i have to be really honest with you i said okay you guys complain about the state being dysfunctional and that we can t get anything right do you we can t you know we had so many issues with edd and the dmv do you think we re really going to open a department that s going to house all of these people that are tracking us for what i said you already say we re incompetent there s no way in hell that we re going to be able to attract as many people so you know at this point people have already made up their mind and i can you know try to use logic as much as possible but it s still you know one one part of the brain is not connecting with the other they believe the rhetoric but when we try to talk about you know practical things like why would they track us why would folks track us and what would they get out of it and you know for what reason there s no answer so so they get offended and then they just stop the conversation and so it s really that conversation as well so when we go back to talking about how we reopen and how our businesses are doing some of them are opening and some of them are you know not they re afraid and so until we can get into a pattern of you know really getting back uh folks back to work then we can make those businesses whole once the revenue starts coming in then you know our cities are going to start doing better because i told you we i have a majority of small businesses in my area well with 11 cities guess what they depend on they depend on that that revenue from those small businesses so the longer they stay shut down the longer that they re not going to be made whole i mean we can sit and talk about this for hours and hours and hours but i do have to say and i know it s not you know people are gonna talk about uh personal freedoms but i was in san francisco by the way on my spare time because you know i have nothing else to do i completed the san francisco half marathon uh a couple weeks ago so i was so thank you thank you um you know i have to do something for my sanity which i thought was really insane that i m using a 13 1 mile uh walk to be you know keep my sanity but that s a whole other conversation but when i was in san francisco i was not able to go to any of the eateries or any uh any places in san francisco without showing my vaccine card which i thought wow this is cool because we re not infringing upon anybody s rights if you know if that s what they re saying but you can t just go out to eat them if you don t have your vaccine so those are choices that folks need to make and at some point they need to make them but i really appreciated san francisco because they did not let me into an eatery unless i showed up my vaccine card and you know if you want to go eat out to eat you want to go to war you want to go somewhere if they if uh you want your life to to return then you show your vaccine card if you don t then you stay home not you know not vaccinated i don t know what answer we can give to folks but it s really hurting our businesses by you know having the stance for and against um the vaccine i think you know if we all do um the right thing for ourselves like if i don t want to do the vaccine and i know that s not what we were going to talk about but if i don t want to take that vaccine that s fine but i have two children i have a a a 14 year old and a 13 year old if anything happened to me i would not be able to to forgive myself because you know we were hearing about tragedies all over where children are being left orphaned because both parents are passed again if you don t care about yourself don t get the vaccine but the consequences are if something happens to you you re leaving your children orphaned and i would not do that to my children and so i chose to vaccinate um you know to do that again i know this is not what we re talking about but i think it s important to have that conversation because it affects our businesses i can t open my businesses um fully because we have these breakout cases we have these you know little pockets of of of uh the cobia popping up because we re not doing what we re asked to do because for whatever reason anyway no that s well said and kind of talking with some people in the business community they re part of this kind of anti vaccine or they re worried about these mandates and i kind of you know go back to them as you put is is what s best for your business is for it to be open and for it to be open and and you know you know people have to get these vaccines and we have to you know empty these hospitals out so you know definitely definitely well put right well and then you know if i can add a little bit i ve got family members in kansas yes i have family in kansas and um uh i you know we re in conversations i lost an uncle to covered um in texas in last october um and just last week three of my family members um actually five three my aunt my niece and uh a cousin are hospitalized um because they were not vaccinating and then um some of the kids the kids around um the family members were sick now they were not hospitalized but they were home not not in school their home and uh one of my cousins is a nurse and she s kind of trying to hold the whole family that found part of the family in kansas together and she s devastated she says how can i you know make our family members understand that this is terrible and so as you can imagine uh in kansas the conversation s very different and some of them are democrats most the majority of my family members are democrats so it s not even you know a republican versus democrat it s about the information that s being spread through the news media through the news outlets i don t know how they depend on on facebook and all of the social media outlets to get their information but you know i talked to my brother and i said you know where are you getting your information from and he says oh well the news is saying it the neighbors and i said have you talked to a doctor and he was like no and i said well when you talk to a doctor call me back and then we can have this conversation because you know the news media is is is biased one way or the other i you know can t get into that but unless we do the research and talk to actual doctors and the doctors tell you don t do it then we can have that conversation but i guarantee you that if everybody listening goes that is anti the vaccine goes talk to an actual medical doctor they ll tell you the truth i i you know i engage on social media because i have to but i don t get my news from social media i don t get you know i talked to my doctor when i went to get vaccinated i was like what do you think they re like absolutely get vaccinated you know and again if you re not doing it for yourself do it for your children because if something happens to you you re going to leave um kids that are orphaned sorry i had to add that because you know if anybody s listening and thinks that i m not going through anything trust me my family members are going through it right now and and of course now that they re in the hospital they re like oh my god i should have gotten vaccinated well by then it s it s too late so don t don t let it be too late take care of your children by taking care of yourself hi and welcome to sac town talks thank you so much for watching our content if you like it make sure to hit that like button and please make sure to subscribe,"stay

go ahead okay all right hello and welcome again to another episode of sac town talks today we have a special guest joining us today we have senator maria dirazzo joining us for the 24th senate district senator dirazzo how s it going thanks for joining us oh i m doing great thank god yeah interesting times to be alive and kind of uh you know in preparation for this show i kind of was you know digging in your background and you you have a quite a fascinating background kind of you know growing up in the central valley going to school up here in northern california then you know ending up in la and kind of working through the labor movement through the past few decades can you kind of for our listeners who don t know can you kind of give us a little background about yourself and how you made your way to sacramento sure um well as you said we were a migrant farmworker family so actually we would travel town to town from calexico all the way to northern california to marysville sacramento area and even as far as oregon so i got to see all these little towns we never really stayed in big cities uh but saw a lot of small towns and you know by being in fresno kind of settling down in in the central valley uh got connected with saint mary s went to school up there have family in northern california but i got connected with some activists while i was at st mary s from los angeles turned out to be you know someone uh um i married uh and then decided to come to to los angeles so i am really glad i did because i love los angeles that was you know i don t know 40 plus years ago right you know i guess it s interesting because you know with your experience i guess up and down the state i guess you ve seen it kind of grow and change um kind of i guess have you been back you know since you ve been elected to some of these farming communities and see i guess how they ve changed since you know when you were a child you know i ve um i ve been through i traveled through um fresno is probably again you know the the hometown there and in some ways there s been some changes certainly fresno has grown enormously from that time and in other ways unfortunately it hasn t changed the way that uh you would want it to you know especially with regards to some of the poverty that s there um but uh i think it s uh you know beautiful people uh that live in in those uh in those towns that work really really hard and it reminds me how grateful we need to be for all the hard work that goes into our agricultural industry those farmworkers are pretty amazing families right so you know you know once you moved to la you got involved with the unions down there and you became you know the leader of unite here were you mostly working in in dc and internationally or were you working state issues as well you know actually i was president of my union in los angeles i always stayed in los angeles and when i got into different positions either regionally or nationally i still did my work out of los angeles the focus for me has always been los angeles except for certain things like uh immigration reform that we have thought we fought over the years very hard for and continue to try to get you know millions of people on a pathway to citizenship so i was really glad to be able to go to different parts of the country whether it was you know massachusetts or florida the east coast chicago or the south texas i was able to connect with a lot of the activism whether it was community activism or it was the labor movement of course in washington dc you have the headquarters for a lot of international unions uh the afl cio i had a position there with the executive council on and all of that was pretty amazing experience for me but always try to use that connection for los angeles and southern california right so kind of what what made you kind of want to switch from you know working with unions and kind of working with government to kind of you know running for office and being elected well as you said i never envisioned myself being the candidate i always was on the side of checking out the candidates who were they could could we trust them you know would they do what we wanted them to do especially with regards to immigrant workers and you know immigrant workers who don t have a ton of money but who contribute enormously to this economy you know i always was on the side of are you really going to get in there and fight for these families so to switch it a little bit i became the candidate um and i truthfully part of the reason i decided to run is we were in the middle we had this campaign where somebody named donald trump uh ran and uh there was there was the environment was changing a lot about immigrants uh changing a lot in a very negative way about women and i just felt that in the political arena we had to have more voices uh for being more respectful of all of everyone in our community so it sort of moved me uh i don t know what exactly but it moved me to to want to run uh there was uh um a trimmed out you know um district um and it was gonna work out just right it was in the district that i had lived in for over 30 years uh so all the pieces just seemed to land and i always felt like i m going in there with no fear of being you know booted out or um that that this community really had the same values as what i ve always fought for yeah so i guess you know i guess running for office and kind of working alongside politicians all these years you know i guess you ve had certain assumptions about what the job would be like i guess you know in your experience have those assumptions kind of held up or is it a little different than you thought you know it s definitely different from what i thought some is the same what i envisioned it but a lot of it is very different i don t think we give enough credit to elected officials publicly elected officials for all the issues that we need to learn to be able to make decisions and vote it you have to learn everything from this morning i was at a listening to experts on water well just that issue alone you have to spend an enormous amount of time trying to understand the difference on water issues from southern california to the central valley to northern california there s issues on education there s issues on workforce development this issue uh on healthcare so the amount of things that we have to learn in order to do the votes and feel good about the votes that we re taking is really a lot and so uh i had not paid attention to that i i that s real different from what um i thought uh was the case um so some things are are are the same i know that there are you have to do you know fundraising which i hate to do but you ve got to fundraise that s a part of running for office you ve got to have the financial support to be able to reach your community um and then the other but the other part that i really um enjoy is being able to get out to the community to get out into the district whether it s here locally whether it s in another part of california and get to know many many more leaders and activists in our districts that are really passionate about what they do there is a group called mujeres de la tierra here that watch out for the l a river is the la river what it should be for the community it s both environmental but it s also all the respect for uh the community that s lived there for many years so there s so many individuals many more individuals that i met that i would not have met i think if i had stayed in the labor movement coming from you know your your union background i guess how much percentage of your time and and effort and kind of legislative priorities are focused on kind of workers rights and union issues versus i guess other issues well i would say that you know a good portion of my time i i don t know how to break it down but it s really about workers working people s issues and whether they re not there s a union involved is really about working people s issues for example i had a bill that was signed into law to eliminate the sub minimum wage for our disabled working men and women that was not a union issue but it was an issue in my opinion about the dignity of work and how what s the least that we should allow to uh that we should require to be paid to people who work so there are many issues that are not particularly quote unquote union issues but they are about the dignity of work and the opportunities we re giving to men and women to do better in their lives i have a firm belief that the poverty in california is due in a big part to we re not paying uh adequate wages and salaries to working men and women and um i know that working men and women have to the families have to live like two in an apartment two families an apartment well that impacts those kids ability to do better in school it impacts whether or not they have connectivity you know privacy issues there s health care issues there s all these things that go back to how are you doing in your job do you have a do you have the uh um do you feel like you really can move forward that you re going to do better in life instead of getting stuck in in one job and at a low pay that s just not good and healthy for everybody so well some might you know look at it as a union issue i see it as the dignity of a working person s issue yeah it s kind of been a interesting i guess year a couple of months is is that you know a lot of uh you know businesses need workers and you know just people aren t coming back to work and you re hearing from a lot of businesses that you know they re down employees or it s very hard to to find employees kind of coming from your background and kind of what you ve known and what you ve seen kind of why do you think people aren t coming back to work as as we expected them to well i think it s probably a sense of um you know this job should allow me to do better in my life um and when i m willing to take the risks to go to work um you know is there respect for this hard work that i m doing so you know i ve not done you know any kind of uh of a study on this but just in general i know that when people feel respected in their work when they re paid good wages when they see themselves as having a future and a career in that work they re they want to go to work they re not hesitant to go to work but if any of those issues are lacking if they re not getting paid something that s fair and decent then they re not going to be excited to go back to work um and or if they think that they re risking their lives and there s not you know the uh uh a respect for that work they re not going to want to go back to work if they see that they re stuck um and unable to get somewhere else a future to look forward to they re not going to be excited about going back to work so i think you know i have yet to hear now in this case i will uh uh invoke the word union but if if um i have not heard from unionized employers that they have any problems in getting people back to work they they know those workers know that they have decent wages and to high wages they have health care coverage they have a pension plan they have a voice in work i i haven t heard too many problems or complaints from uh unionized employers very interesting you know as you kind of noted earlier you know one piece of legislation that you had signed can you kind of i guess give us a recap on some other uh kind of bills you had signed by the governor on some some of the things you were working on this year yes um well we had a bill on the domestic workers uh being able to have a a process to get um to have health and safety rights on the job it s not a requirement of domestic employers household employers but it s working in the direction of we found for example that domestic workers during the the fires in northern california weren t being given the equipment to be able to clean after the fires they re being asked to clean but they weren t given the protections or the equipment to properly clean and protect themselves so we did that for domestic workers we re going in the direction of them having sort of a health and safety rights on the job um that s an another one we also were able to get more low income undocumented workers to have access to health care which they didn t before that really really came to light with the pandemic is that here you had essential industries essential workers without access to health care of course uh their ability to take care of themselves take care of their families was impossible mind you they re working but they don t have access to health care they re working they they can t even in the exchange by healthcare for themselves so we re able to include now in medi cal those of 50 years old 50 or older uh would have access to medical if they re low income um so there are uh you know a number of um pieces of legislation like that interesting you know i think it was announced what a couple weeks ago that you know we re projected to have a 32 billion dollar surplus and you know by the time the end of the year s over maybe even more kind of what are some of your thoughts of some of the priorities we should look at for next year on kind of spending and you know maybe solving some of the state s issues well i think that um i mentioned uh having a briefing on water issues uh there s uh that s one area that we have to look at is how are we addressing the infrastructure that s needed for us to be able to have water to have clean water to have affordable water it s different within the central valley than it is in southern california but we ought to look at how that funding could be used for our infrastructure and maybe even to assist uh those families who can t afford to pay for for good and clean and safe drinking water so that s one the other is our green infrastructure transportation we need to do a better job with public transportation and that s an investment it s going to take an investment on our part at the same time that would be good for the environment it would create uh good well paid jobs and careers uh for thousands and thousands of people uh so that s a good thing that we should uh invest in um of course you know um uh education you know will get uh automatically a certain increase in in funding that s a good thing we had a look and see even though we invested this last budget into the um um you know the internet and broadband uh uh issues we ought to you know look at that again and say is that sufficient are we going in the right direction um so there s a number of ways i think those are really essential things that we need to look at a workforce development we have a lack of workers in certain industries that are really highly needed there are certain industries where there s going to be retirement age leaving their jobs are we ready to replace them there s certain jobs and careers where we don t have the um diversity that we need in health care we need more diversity when it comes to those jobs doctors that we don t have enough uh latinos uh and other african americans so and women so we need to do a better job on the workforce development level uh with you know high road uh employers and high road training programs so i think that there will be a lot of ways uh in which we could invest in people now in such a way that it s gonna um be good in the long term not just you know spending money for the sake of spending money right you know a lot of the past what year or two years a lot of talk has been about homelessness and how to address the statewide homelessness issues uh you know kind of in your district have you seen things improving in the homelessness front with all that s been spending and and you see things i guess improving and i m glad you brought that up because housing is another area where we could invest more of more of our our revenue i do see um music spots of of improvement i know here locally in my district there are several areas in which there s at least uh short term immediate shelter uh and and housing and then a wrap around services that is being done there s at least four areas in my district where um hundreds and hundreds of unhoused uh were persuaded uh to leave their tents leave living on the streets and go into temporary shelter and be open to getting the services that they need by the way that was another bill actually was in the budget started out as a bill of mine which is a homeless hiring tax credit for employers who hired currently or just recent unhoused individuals so that they could get a job and they would be paid 120 of the minimum wage so um i think i could see things starting to happen with more urgency and i m hopeful that other things that we re doing around creating more housing and creating more affordable housing uh that that will uh have even greater impact in with regards to our uh our needs yeah you know uh you know next year s rolling around here pretty pretty quick before we know it what are some of the pieces of legislation you re looking to kind of introduce next week year or maybe you already have introduced that you re looking to kind of work on and address coming up next session well i think that there are are still a few issues around criminal justice that i um particularly interested in one of those is the sun setting of records um criminal justice records um that we know that there are eight million californians who have either been arrested and or convicted uh that means it will show up for the rest of their lives on their records and that has a huge impact on those individuals the kinds of jobs that they could have it has an impact on programs they could become eligible or ineligible for they can t even do things in many cases such as big coaches you know to their kids teams there s so many ways in which we re impacted impacting them by having these records on them for the rest of their lives we spend an enormous amount of money i know because my budget oversees the criminal justice system there we spend enormous amounts of money while they re in incarcerated or right after they get incarcerated there are so many ways in which they want to get back on their feet but they can t we invest in them and we say you know you know for so that they wouldn t be re incarcerated for something else um and yet they still have these barriers barriers to jobs barriers to housing barriers to you know reintegrating um so that s one thing i m looking forward to addressing in the in the legislature um and i like i said i think the uh environment uh jobs connected to a cleaner environment like transportation there s those kinds of things it s what i continue to be very very much concerned and excited to address yeah you know i guess you know you re home you re in your district uh you know you re talking to a lot of your constituents what what are some of the issues kind of on top of mind of a lot of your constituents coming in here to the end of the year uh well you you mentioned uh uh one of them which is our unhoused it is of great concern and i think it s starting to become a concern over in some areas over safety and so it s it s not only our compassion uh and how do we allow in a country in a state that is so wealthy how do we allow so many individuals to continue to live on the street so that s a big concern are we doing enough around mental health needs we found that um that mental health needs uh are you know are becoming younger for younger and younger individuals uh and so are we investing enough there the pandemic impacted a lot of individuals um and young and and older so uh those are some of the things that that have been brought brought to my attention of course we want to make sure that um in our small businesses you know do we have the funding to allow our small businesses to you know continue to do better as we slowly reopen um and give the the the support that our small businesses need right you know there s been a lot of news lately about the capital annex being closed down uh have you said goodbye to your old sacramento office and had a chance to to move into the new building yet you know i was lucky that um you see two days ago i went to sacramento uh and it was the second day that we had moved into the the new building um so i didn t get to say goodbye to the old uh the old office um but you know it s uh it s not as uh spacey in some ways but it you know it s new um and uh we just have to get adjusted to a whole different place i guess we re gonna be there maybe three four five years five years maybe as long as five years that that i m hearing um you know there s some minor things that we ve got to get adjusted to the walking back and forth between this new building yeah yeah you have to have your walking shoes i don t know maybe i ll buy a golf cart or something and find a parking space for that uh you know charge my colleagues you know two bucks you know to get them back and forth um so yeah it s gonna be different we have this open space uh that we didn t have before because it was always to go down the hall and go into an office and come back go back into the hallway this is much more open uh meeting space uh that we have so it s it s things to get uh used to uh um i ll miss the miss the old office that s for sure they re all the same size as i understand it too oh they re all equal there s no there s no they re all yeah yeah yeah so you know we can t get punished and get thrown out of them hear that but yeah it s it s a it s a it s a it s a it s a very nice building very nice building you know a holiday season kind of one of those seasons where you know a lot of members give back to their community kind of what are some of the things you re working on uh you know this thanksgiving and christmas to kind of help your community out and kind of give back well um i m glad yes that we just did for thanksgiving uh we did a number of our own um food giveaways and you find that the need is still quite enormous we have in fact trying to turn the camera around so you could see our hallways packed packed with boxes of toys um that have been donated uh either by individuals or by businesses um you know who look to us to help find you know the right you know the right ways to distribute these toys to uh to children and and to families and i know those kids are looking forward to it there are many families who are not going to be able to buy toys and that s a really very sad thing to see in so many uh in so many parts of our of our district so i ll you know get out there both food and and toys and then continue to see um how can our safety net do a better job of getting our resources into communities sometimes individuals and families are intimidated you know by the system not quite sure how to how to you know navigate the system um and so they rely on uh not the official safety net you know do the applications and fill out all those forms but they rely on you know an organization in their community down the street that does the food giveaway or does the um the toy giveaway you know that s much more they re they re much more trusting of that um so these community based organizations are really essential to helping either access the formal safety net or you know be able to get food and and toys for their kids well that s great thanks for doing that and taking care of your community that s that s a great story and and definitely within the spirit so that s that s uh that s awesome thank you thank you and i i find more more and more and more um more and more individuals are uh anxious to do something like that and contribute back to their communities right definitely well i know you re busy and we we uh got to let you go but thank you so much for taking the time and talking with us about your priorities and your background and we re looking forward to seeing what you re going to do next year and hopefully we can follow up with you and kind of see how it s going absolutely anytime you you make me feel very comfortable about what uh you know what we re talking about so um i appreciate you and happy holidays to everybody happy holidays thank you oh,"retirement age,immigration,surplus,latinos,criminal,values,small businesses,homeless,homelessness,washington,education,health care,criminal

again to another episode of sac town talks today we have a very special guest joining us senator nancy skinner nancy how s it going thanks for joining us hey happy to be with you yeah where are you joining us from today are you in the district are you here in sacramento i am in sacramento in my uh well i ll say capital office but we re in a new building because the capital is going to be worked on in the next couple years yeah so you re in the new swing space how are you i guess enjoying the transition and the the new building so far it s uh it s a transition it s you know getting used to it yeah do you have those curtains come with the office or those temporary well they have these screens yeah they re they come with the office um uh they ve been telling us not to put anything on the walls but of course you know hey we re gonna want to decorate our walls so we will be putting things on the walls so nancy but you know before we started this you know i i ve talked to you many times throughout the years but i ve never looked at your bio this is the first time i looked at your bio and the most interesting thing i saw of many which there are is in 1984 you were a student at berkeley and you also ran for city council is that right yes i was a grad student but yes i ran for the berkeley city council and i won wow and so i i guess were you one of the first students to to do that first and only no other person while they were a registered registered student at cal has been elected now subsequent to me we have a current council member um uh um terribly blanking this day but you know uh anyway he um was elected right after he graduated and he had served in the student government as i had and he had been our external affairs asuc external affairs vice president and that s council member rigel robertson wow even even from the beginning in 1984 you re taking on big issues styrofoam things like that kind of what was it like being on the city council and being a student back then well it was i mean it was juggling a lot because i was also a new mom of all things um but in during that time i was part of a really vibrant community based electoral coalition berkeley citizens action and that organization had was the backbone for the successful candidacies of tom bates for assembly who was later our mayor lonnie hancock for mayor and then later assembly uh ron dellums for congress um you know it was a very strong coalition a very diverse just many many groups uh senior activists great panthers um tenant activists health care activists um student activists um ten rent contr people pro rent control um different we had some of the first lgbtq elected officials we re talking back in the early 80s um so it was this really vibrant coalition and the reason i bring it up is because it made serving on the city council easier because you really felt you were part of this big community and we worked out our positions on a lot of issues and they brought me things it wasn t like i was just um certainly i represented the citizens of berkeley that i represented but it was like this whole coalition brought me good ideas and uh worked in the community to get support for those ideas and so it was a great experience you know you know college football season has just ended and all i hear about nancy is this name image likeness stuff all over athletes are transferring them everywhere getting these big deals and you know you are the the genesis of this the start of this here in california kind of how how did you uh kind of come up with this and um how come your name isn t everywhere on this so you know who would have expected the state senator california state senator uh from berkeley white woman uh that i would be the one to basically change the course of student athlete history and basically um you know it s never you never do anything alone there were you know that the ncaa was under a lot of pressure from court cases from you know so many things it was definitely every time you turned on a college sports game you heard some pundit or announcer or even this athlete themselves talk about how unfair the nca rules were about phony amateurism and such so you know it was really um i suppose you could say timing is the secret of comedy it was like i was a lucky timer but um i ve actually been thinking about that issue for a very long long time when i was a grad student at cal i was one of the people that helped to organize the graduate union of teachers instructors tas which is now the union that represents every type of graduate student employee and i always felt that you know as students we should be compensated for our work if the university is if we re producing something of value for the university we should be compensated for our work and i always looked at athletes i m like you know they re bringing a lot of value to the university but i had the great fortune of hearing a lecture by harry edwards who was a sociologist at cal at uc berkeley but he was also the organizer of the boycott the black suit olympic boycott in mexico city where the runners from san jose state juan carlos tommy smith others you know basically um you know said hey uh this amateurism is doesn t work and he talked about just the way that especially he came from the lens of black and brown athletes generating enormous amounts of profits and money revenue for professional sports for colleges and the fact that they were not adequately taken care of they were exploited and so i looked at it initially from a very um racial uh perspective but over time as i watched as i watched title ix and i saw that women athletes really get the bad end of the stick i mean we don t get a fair amount of time in the locker rooms fair amount of time on the equal equipment fair amount of time on the fields and such and then you look at what in march madness how they treated last year the women basketball players compared to the male basketball players it was just outrageous and i saw that women they don t even get a chance by enlarge to gopro and when they do get pro they re not even paid at all so here they are at the peak of their prowess while they re a student athlete and they can t get anything so like i said i ve been thinking about it a long time and when i first got elected to the state senate in 2016 i told my staff i want student athletes to be paid tas are paid you know others are paid they they ought to be able to form a union and my staff said i was crazy that we would never be able to pull that off and so each year i would come back to him and say nope gonna introduce bill going to introduce bill and they re like no no we won t be able to do that and i said okay you can t tell me no again you have to come up with alternative or i m introducing the bill that i want to and they are the ones who came up working with other people on the concept to give name image and likeness which i think is a first step it should not be the only step right well it s amazing just kind of seeing these these deals kind of sprout up everywhere and and you know with social media and everything the you know the amount of money some of these uh athletes and many women many women yeah great large followings they have so yes uh it s gonna be interesting to watch right definitely definitely changing the world of college sports and hopefully it will help the cal bears right i hope so because cal bears haven t been in the rose bowl since 1959 yeah so you know you re not one shy to take on big issues as if you ve taken on the ncaa and changed college football you know the next thing police unions police records kind of you know how have you seen your work there uh unfolding kind of what do you have planned in the works for the future well um california this is another one we were a real outlier we have a very good public records act so you know if you want if you are a resident you want to have information about in a public employee you can request that information get records on basically every employee right except for law enforcement and so for 40 years there was no public access whatsoever to any records around any activity of an officer now one could say you know why should we need that why why is there need to be public records access there you know sunshine transparency really helps it helps create good government and when it comes to law enforcement law enforcement more than anything needs the trust of the community to do their jobs and when you feel like hey wait a minute you know we we saw this behavior by an officer in our neighborhood we don t see anything that s happened to them you know we don t trust them uh that does not bode well for solving crime right and you could never find out about whether your local police department ever disciplined an office officer for example for any of their misconduct you couldn t even find out what misconduct might have occurred in your jurisdiction so while i was in the assembly i had uh then senator leno had tried to you know create some open records for police and i voted for that bill at least two times and he was never successful and so when i got in the senate people approached me and i felt like yeah we need to keep this is uh it s important for good policing good public safety and good community relations and it s just it s it s the right thing to do so i did carry that bill sb1421 and i was successful and i really was pleased and again it was a very huge team effort and my colleagues supported it and then we ve subsequently expanded with some other categories of records so it s still limited access around other public employees you can get much more information so it s limited access you can get about officers behavior but at least it s the core things that you know core misconduct like if an officer has um uh been dishonest on the job tampered with evidence interfered with the witness and also around if they ve if they ve engaged in excessive violence or discriminatory behavior so now california residents can feel confident they can get that information you know you had a unique experience kind of starting the assembly when you know the budget was tough it was difficult to negotiate there were no surpluses and now you re kind of in this you know the last few years we ve had surpluses and you know money to spend with the state and now you know as you a budget chair in the senate uh you know how has it been working on the budget this last year and you know with this year s surplus around 40 billion and maybe more kind of what s the senate and kind of your thoughts on the budget uh coming up here in 2022 sure so yes when i got elected in the assembly 2008 double whammy number one the recession california s revenues were just evaporating it was awful we had like a 60 billion dollar deficit 60 billion and we had to cut schools to the point where they were you know we already california was already the lowest per pupil funder of its public schools and it was very uh we became like mississippi it was terrible and we had the requirement that you had to get a two thirds vote to approve the budget we did not have a super majority of democrats so we had to negotiate with the republicans and you know hey bipartisan effort is always good but the problem with that particular kind of negotiation is the republicans would hold the budget hostage and we wouldn t get budgets passed it was a very traumatic experience now last year this year as budget share we have revenues in excess of 60 billion dollars the complete opposite the highest revenues we ve ever ever seen the highest per pupil funding um ever california s received and getting up into more than you know up to like i don t know in where we are in the rest of the states but above 25 other states in terms of per pupil funding which is great and the irony of this is partly it s we have great revenues because the stock market did so well and because we have some very wealthy californians and our progressive tax structure allows us to collect healthy amounts of revenue from those people who are doing very very very well but we also have a huge inequity problem we have a lot of californians who are struggling and you know what we call the middle class it s very difficult to be middle class in california now with the cost of housing and such and people that are in the poverty you know at or below poverty level is very high in california and that s just you know for me as a progressive democrat that i i can t see how we can be the fifth largest economy and i m now talking state of california fifth largest economy in the world and that we would have this level of poverty and income inequity so um state senate in the democratic caucus have um we ve really tried to to look at how do we put california s wealth to work for an equitable economy how do we lift up in all the boats so it s been great to be budget chair in that kind of context and last year we were able to make california the first state to provide every public school student two free meals a day at school so that is a great thing so we do not have to worry about kids coming to school hungry and not being able to learn or you know having that difficulty they re they re fed if they choose to be and that was a incredible thing to be able to pull off in last year s budget and i m looking forward to good things this year you know as you said you know there s been a lot of talk about housing in california i know that s something you focused on especially in your district where you know housing is so tough to come by kind of what are you seeing in the housing space right now and kind of what else can you guys do to kind of make housing more affordable here in california well housing is really when i think about what are our big challenges the pandemic kovid s ongoing the climate crisis huge challenge is not going away and housing because we have california has not built enough housing for decades and when you have a shortage like we have a growth in population a growth in jobs in certain of our job centers but not a growth in housing then that makes that commodity very expensive so each unit of housing that s there is very expensive and then with just construction costs have gone up materials cost supply costs labor costs so building new housing is also expensive and what what that does to us is make housing really unaffordable for most californians so we have to build a lot more and we have to provide subsidy so that a good amount of that housing can be affordable housing when we think about our homelessness crisis it is very much because of a shortage of housing and that shortage leading to these high costs those you know the vast vast majority of people who are unhoused living on our streets they would never have chosen to that is not their chosen lifestyle and many of them were living you know had a regular roof over their heads less than two years ago less than three years ago um and our californians so that s something that a lot of my colleagues and i have been very committed to i m very happy to see the governor committed to it last year we put 2 billion towards 4 billion total 2 billion each year towards the very affordable housing the homeless housing we put another couple of billion towards you know other types of affordable housing and i look forward to continuing that type of investment again this year plus we passed lots of legislation that made it easier to get housing approved yeah have you started seeing any benefits of your sb 330 kind of being implemented yet by local governments yes two of the big success stories of our housing bills and i m talking about the legislature as a whole one of them was our adu bills the accessory dwelling units and the most recent bill that was successful was assembly member tings i was a co author actually it had been my bill the year before but we uh anyway typical what happens is sometimes a bill gets hung up in a year so then you join forces with another colleague the following year and that bill basically gave the green light to almost any and every single family home in california to be able to build at least one if not more accessory drilling units and basically their local government s not able to tell those um owners not being able to tell them no so in other words you can t now say no you can t do an adu so what we ve seen in los angeles the largest number of units of new housing construction over the last three to four years have all been these accessory dwelling units now many of them are up to like 800 square feet to a thousand square feet so they re not just for a college student or a single person there you know there are units that uh can accommodate you know a number of people so that s been a great great success story and then my bill sb 330 basically said look local governments you ve already done all your zoning you ve done your eirs for that zoning and if an application comes into your door that meets your existing rules you have to limit the amount of time that you process that limit the number of public hearings and give it a green light because if they ve met what you ve asked them to meet we need that housing built so sp 330 um really has we ve uh my staff and i we haven t necessarily documented everyone but we re we re constantly being informed by a different jurisdiction or a different project you know entity that is building some housing like hey yeah we this housing is now going through because of sp 330 we were you know we ve been trying to get a permit for three years five years whatever but we got the green light as soon as 3 30 came through and we re seeing much more housing as a result and that s a great thing yeah you know the last week the big news was single payer health care that they re working on over there in the assembly kind of what are some of your thoughts on how california could implement a single payer health care and pay for it well single payer is the most efficient form of delivery of health care and it cuts out a lot of the um administrative costs or middleman as you might call that is making our healthcare expensive um but it s also can be costly eventually it doesn t have to be so costly but setting up the structure of it now in the meantime and there s obviously many good arguments for that for that type of system of healthcare and most other um economies of the size of california have that now interestingly with the governor s the budget that he proposed on january 10th and his offer that we would provide medi cal to every californian who is eligible regardless of their circumstance that under that context with the combination of the affordable care act and what we have done with medi cal and with of course medicaid our seniors already get really if we were to pass what the governor has presented to us in the budget january 10th then we would have healthcare as an accessible for every californian now there is that question that undercover california some californians who this employer doesn t provide it for them have the cost involved but we ve kept that cost much lower than most states so there s still some affordability issues but basically california would have achieved if we approve that budget that he s proposed we would have health care access to every california and i i guess you know why is that i guess not enough i guess for some advocates that you know they want a whole new scale system well there s you know time there s a lot of issues around again cost of health care and these different layers that add costs and whether single payer eventually could trim that down there s also the question of you have under a medi cal system you ve got some practitioners who won t take a medi cal patient so that can put a person at a disadvantage um so those are some of the difficulties even with the good things that we have done so far in california yeah you know global warming has always been a concern and something that you know you ve helped uh to work on uh in your time here in the scent in the assembly kind of what are the some of the things you re working on now and i know you re working on some carbon sequestration you know why is that an answer to help kind of some of the global warming concerns we have well the climate crisis is well underway and we already have way too much carbon way too much global warming gases in our atmosphere and while we have to stop emissions even stopping emissions which is not going to happen overnight is not going to bring the temperatures down to the levels or avoid the catastrophic climate change that we need to avoid we need to get some of that carbon that s up there out and i know that some advocates feel that anything that you if we move towards any types of carbon sequestration that that s just like a path for justifying fossil fuels but you know it doesn t have to be a path for justifying fossil fuels it really can be a path for getting carbon out and buying us some time as we transition off the fossil fuels so the the um one of the bills i ll be working on this year my colleague senator becker put new requirements on our cement industry and so cement is a very uh very polluting from a climate point of view um i don t want cement necessarily cement manufacturing to leave california so because we we produce cleaner cement than almost anywhere else so if we can assist them and pilot some carbon capture at our cement facilities then we can see how carbon sequestration works whether we can capture some there and we can assist that the cement manufacturing so that s one of the things i m looking at oh interesting you know you re never one to shy away from anything you know we ve covered a lot of things here today but you know what else are you looking you know towards you know doing this year with your legislation package um good questions i m uh green hydrogen so one of the fuels that could really help us in the climate crisis is non fossil based hydrogen um and we can use we can use our solar resources when we re producing more solar than we need we could use it to produce hydrogen and then hydrogen could be used to fuel power plants fuel vehicles lots of things but we need to create the right market signals to drive that non fossil based hydrogen so that s one of the things i m looking at but the other thing i m really excited about are you know i mentioned early in our conversation about the inequity in california so we have a lot of kids who uh children who are in poverty level um and that s being exacerbated now by the pandemic we had many many california children 20 000 estimate who lost their parent or caregiver to covet so now they ve had a death and if they were low income already if their family was low income and then they have a parent that might have been the an income earner who s passed away the federal government provides some survivor benefits but when those kids turn 18 who you know where s where s their support so i have introduced a bill that would create hope accounts for the low for the children who lost a parent to covid who s in from a low income family so that when they turn 18 they have some money that they can look to to help them whether it s pursue their education pursue training put the first and last month deposit just give them that hope that the rest of us usually rely on our families for and then we also want to use those hope accounts for our um children that are in long term foster care because if you re in long term foster care that means you don t have parents you can rely on so that s the other concept within our hope accounts so i m very excited about that well i know i know you need to go you re a busy woman and doing big things so thank you so much for taking the time and joining us and we look forward to seeing what you re up to this year and hopefully we can catch up on with you later well it was great fun and thank you for inviting me

commissioners and that was a mistake thank you the state of california and governor newsom has prioritized the corporate health over the victims of pg e s wildfires why was pg e invited in to the governor s office is it fair to say pg e s influence with the governor got them protection and reward in the face of crimes yes music california s burning crisis costs all of us to solve it we have to master the three core elements fire power money as the entire town of paradise evacuated a retired cal fire dispatcher drove toward the flames i knew people were dying i really hoped it wasn t anybody i knew but i knew people were dying just driving up music it was worse than the big fire steve bradley trained four years ago as a volunteer firefighter in paradise on his way up he called his mom and his grandma colleen i ll see you soon love you bye that was the last time i talked to her music we were getting used to the idea of her moving in with us you know not to losing her grandma colleen s daughter muriel had a room ready but even at age 96 colleen wasn t ready to move in yet she kept putting it off because she didn t want to give up her independence up by the fire steve had to stop at the roadblocks his mom made it out but nobody heard from grandma colleen i looked up and i knew where my grandma s house was and just watching the fire march down the hill towards chico ethel colleen riggs joined the list of hundreds missing next morning her name showed up at an evacuation site i had the picture still her name s on the board i was ecstatic i thought i found her i found a nurse to help me she came back out music and she said she was in there and i knew just like that i knew you know that was the last hope this is grandma colleen s house investigators found her remains cremated in her own laundry room that s just one family s horror my little sister my father was found in the bathroom didn t want to die she s hiding in her house pg e admitted to killing all these people this is the hook that killed 84 people these hooks are what are holding the electrical lines off the ground and pg e s decision was simply just to let these things hang until they broke because it saved them money apparently they knew they knew those power lines weren t safe and they d known for years and just didn t do anything guilty of 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter negligence a reckless disregard for life and you re sitting across from me telling me but we have it hasn t sounded an alarm yeah that s the problem nobody s taking any of these things seriously enough if it were me i would have been in jail a long long long time ago but pg e gets a pass because they re a corporation corporations can t go to prison we take no pride in the fact that the the punishment is so little instead of 90 years behind bars the judge sentenced pg e to pay the maximum fine under california law ten thousand dollars per victim killed we are not holding these people accountable and we do have mechanisms to hold them accountable mike ramsey at least got them to admit that they killed all those people and what should have happened at that point that s when the system should have kicked in you are a killer corporation do you understand that that means something in terms of with regulatory agencies with governor s offices with legislatures has it really meant something has pg e s reputation as a convicted killer actually earned it stricter treatment from the people in charge of its state monopoly license our nearly three year long investigation reveals the opposite the state government did more than just help pg e avoid accountability governor gavin newsom s administration responded to pg e s crimes by offering the company reward and protection the governor doesn t want to talk about it he s declined or ignored every interview request we ve sent dating back to his time as governor elect and the state is still rewarding pg e even though pg e is already under more criminal investigations cal fire personnel on the site brought to his attention and then our attention what appears to be a broken jumper on one of our transmission towers for starting two more fires that burned homes the zog fire killed four people even after those fires california state government gave pg e this an official state safety certificate this is more than a label it s worth money big music across money with mega jackpots it s mega millions music let s see if i can make you a billionaire tonight that is the draw for the biggest single winning lottery ticket in us history just two weeks before the campfire 1 5 billion dollars if pg e starts another fire that big this safety certificate could be worth 10 times more money than that the safety certificate lets pg e and the two other big investor owned power companies tap into a 21 billion dollar state insurance fund half paid for by utilities and half paid by the customers through a surcharge on power bills for 20 years utilities in the fund can start a big fire negotiate a settlement with the victims and get this state fund to pay those victims out the signature on pg e s first safety certificate belongs to alice stebbins i didn t i did not want to sign this stebbins was executive director of the california public utilities commission pg e s state regulator what would you say to the people of paradise that i m sorry she turned whistleblower and cleaned out her desk fired by the puc s five commissioners is it fair to say pg e s influence with the governor got them protection and reward in the face of crimes i think that s fair assessment yes i do how did it work through ab1054 ab 1054 is the state law that created the safety certificates signed by governor gavin newsom who benefited from more than 200 thousand dollars in political donations from pg e have you reconsidered giving the money back to pg e that they contributed to your campaign no i i my actions the suggestion is somehow contributions have changed actions took what i just passed the law the governor is pointing at gave pg e a safety certificate for making a plan to be safe but it didn t actually require pg e to be safe that s not how the bill started we obtained documents the public rarely gets to see draft versions of the safety certificate bill weeks before it was revealed to state lawmakers these documents show the law was crafted by omelvany and myers the law firm governor newsom hired to represent him in pg e s bankruptcy payment records show that law firm charged the taxpayers three million dollars during the six months when the law took shape financial firm guggenheim also helped create the governor s new law billing taxpayers 3 7 million dollars the state has a whole agency dedicated to writing bills we asked the governor why he hired private firms to do it instead but the governor s office didn t answer at the time the bill was being drafted pg e hadn t pleaded guilty to the camp fire crimes yet but the company was already a convicted felon that the judgment was strong but you know it s never enough because i can never get my family back serving time on probation for the deadly san bruno gas explosion that s why when the bill was being debated any questions we pressed the governor for answers about pg e s money pg e was convicted of a federal of six federal felonies in 2016 after that you took more than two hundred thousand dollars to help get elected how should people trust you to be running the show to come up with the solution i um i wish you luck with whatever you re working on but uh that s a strange question you asked that question before you knew what he was doing former san diego city attorney mike aguirre represents pg e customers fighting the company s bailout he uncovered calendar entries things like meet and greets with pg e s leaders at the governor s office in the weeks when the governor s bill was being crafted kills her your honor 84 times they said guilty your honor and yet there was a disconnect between that and being shown in the front door at the governor s office and being given special legislation and special protection why why was pg e invited in to the governor s office alice stebbins says ab 1054 made pg e s safety certificate automatic the bottom line was i was told to sign it you will sign this period the governor s bill did create a new wildfire safety division to work with utilities our investigation reveals though the governor s lawyers watered the bill down as they revised the language they chipped away that new agency s power to enforce safety to get a safety certificate this early draft would have made utilities earn a positive safety determination from the agency two days later the authors struck out determination and made it only a staff recommendation by the time state lawmakers got to see the bill even that language was gone to get its first safety certificate the final law only made pg e do four things all of them on paper out in fire country stebbin says the law made pg e do nothing did it have to trim trees well they should have but no no did they have to go out and inspect their hooks and replace old equipment to get the certificate they should have for the extensive benefits that a company gets from having a safety certificate it should come with the accountability nat skinner heads safety for the puc s own consumer advocate office pg e s safety certificate worries him so it makes it harder to hold the utility accountable before the governor s bill power companies couldn t build the cost of wildfire damage to their customers unless they proved they acted prudently or reasonably the governor s bill changed the rules it automatically deems a power company reasonable if it has a safety certificate more than that even if someone manages to prove the utility was unreasonable in causing a fire the governor s bill capped how much it could hurt the shareholders profits even if they weren t prudent yes why on earth would we want to cap how much the utilities would have to pay back to the wildfire fund if they were wrong in causing the fire to protect the utility so if this had been in place during the 17 18 and 19 fires pg e shareholders would have been on the hook for about four billion dollars not for the tens of billions that they ve ultimately ended up paying out and that s what the certificate gets them yes they could cause another campfire potentially and not have to go bankrupt this time yes i think that s obscene i don t understand why this is allowed why they get the safety certificate they get to self insure and they get to set up the rules that don t benefit anybody but themselves in a written response to our reporting governor newsome s office pointed out the law required pg e to spend money on safety upgrades money that a federal judge says the company should have spent years ago instead of draining its safety budgets to pay out bigger profits newsome s office ignored all our specific questions about the much bigger amount of money that law gave to the safety certificate program the government has made it more of a priority for pg e to come out

game and then went back in the evening because i had other responsibilities to attend to but not complaining i got to tell you i m not complaining this is the best gig ever love what i do love being able to represent and being able to you know get some wins for the district yeah wow so i guess how was that i guess through the last what year i guess kind of dealing with you know kids at home and keeping this busy schedule okay so you know i m a former teacher and i just have to say god bless um teachers of course i was one of them but let me tell you i never really understood when i was a full time teacher i didn t really understand parents that homeschooled their kids i can tell you that i understand them even less now i don t know why you want to be with your children all day long i am a credentialed teacher and was still having a hard time trying to teach my own children but that was one part of it but the other part is there s a sense of they go to school they do what they do you come back and you re so happy to see them right you know you get to interact with them instead of you know really arguing i think that s what we did mostly and if there s any parents listening you know exactly what i m talking about you spent most of your time fighting with them about doing their work and keeping up with this and keeping up with that when they go to school you you you do your thing they do their thing and you come back as a family later and you re like hey i love you good to see you instead of by the end of the day we want to kill each other because we ve been arguing all day yeah and yeah no there s like a different level of respect that they have for teachers or coaches versus you know when parents try to tell them to do i notice that too yeah absolutely that s interesting so you know since you ve been you know spending time in the district you know talking with your constituents kind of working events kind of what what are a lot of your constituents kind of talking about with you and kind of i guess concerned about coming up you know in this coming months and years well you know um i i don t think it s unusual to everybody you know the number one issue right now is the homelessness issue and um for for our communities especially in my area you know we see a lot of folks that are struggling um financially i have a lot of low income community members and we re trying to do the best that we can for them i i think for any community in california at the end of the day folks want a roof over their heads food on their table and a great education for their children and i think we re all on board with that but how we get there for everybody is very different so the conversation always goes back to homelessness i uh spent the last couple months even while in session you know talking to a lot of my superintendents a lot of my city managers going to some city council meetings because i think part of the problem is we we had the rent moratorium and through the state budget which i m part of we had an amazing opportunity to make folks hole not just the renters but the landlords to be able to get money so that they were not losing this opportunity to make everybody whole so that we can all continue when we get out completely out of the pandemic everybody still has a place to live unfortunately that money is not getting to the hands of the people that need it and we re trying to figure out why so like i said i spent a lot of time talking to the superintendent s schools um my city managers the mayors and council members because when i talked to them i said oh look there s this program you know we have all this money for for folks to be able to access rental assistants and a lot of them didn t know it existed which was really a surprise to me so we spent myself and my staff spent a lot of time going around the um kind of my different cities i represented 11 cities um making sure that they knew as a teacher i can tell you that a lot of the information that was um distributed was from outside sources so i talked to my superintendents i said hey if i send you a you know copy of this where folks can access this rental assistance can you help me distribute it and some of them did not all of them but some of them did distribute it but i think you know the constituency i think again at the end of the day they want a roof over their head food on their table and a good education for their kids and so part of the challenge for a lot of folks is making the rent or choosing between rent and food and so that s two out of three priorities right and then with the with the school being shut down the school s been shut down um the majority of the year um you know that was another um issue that we were dealing with is how are we going to make these kids catch up to basically a year lost um you know in education so those really by far those three things were always a priority for my for my constituents now on the other hand you know i have a lot of business community members i have 11 cities and in my district and kind of the senate district there s 20 000 small businesses folks misunderstand when i say i m from l a county a lot of the folks that are not familiar with my area assume that we are part of the you know the downtown l a all the big buildings all those big corporations and those big buildings and they don t understand that san gabriel valley is not downtown l a our communities depend on small businesses in order for them to survive so the personal part again um uh was a roof over their head food on their table and and a great education for their kids you flip that to the business community and the business communities you know hurting how are they going to keep their doors open you know et cetera right excuse me so i guess how i guess how are your cities doing coming out of covet 19 you know i guess the rental assistance is gonna i guess expire this month so i guess kind of heading into the end of the year and into next year are they recovering nicely or kind of do you see i guess problems no definitely a lot of problems um i think like i said my communities i depend on the small businesses so we re trying to make the small businesses you know whole again um either through legislation through assistance for them and i think the number one priority is to get everybody back to work after the the moratorium ends i hope not but i believe that there s going to be an influx of folks losing their their their homes their apartments and i think the way we we can head that off is by making sure that everybody s back at work and so there is that you know folks are uh trying to do the right thing right and make sure that that we re open for business but i think a lot of our community members and i m going to say it um you know believe that um they have this idea about the vaccine um you know for whatever reason that it they re not going to take it so i think the challenge is for us right now is make making sure everybody s vaccinated um so that we that um you know the local eateries are are comfortable opening because you know you don t infect everybody and but again we have different challenges i represent a community that s more moderate and so i hear a lot of the rhetoric and you know just to be honest with you it s not even the the more red cities in my area that that have that that belief about the covid and about the vaccine some of my local communities mainly and i and it s uh interesting to me mainly a lot of the older um uh latino women are like no you know they tell me that they you know the misinformation is as being passed along so one lady said she said that uh you know that she s not taking the vaccine because there s a tracker in it and so i you know instead of i was baffled right but but i i said you know with respect in spanish i said um if they re tracking you like what did you do that you re afraid of being tracked you know and she was like obviously no answer because they re listening to this rhetoric and i said and and if they tracked you what would you be doing i said because they can track me and i can tell you i go to work i pick up the kids from drop the kids off at school go to work pick them up go to you know to do my my jobs i said so if they tracked me they would track me you know back and up and forth from home to work and so i don t know you know what we re afraid of about being tracked because our cell phones track us 100 of the time so so she she didn t quite understand that they re it s interesting there s two mind frames right so she s talking about the being tracked and when i was trying to be logical about the fear of being tracked um she didn t really have an answer and then so of course i you know i stopped and then you know throughout my conversations with other community members you know some of that information comes comes up and i have to be really honest with you i said okay you guys complain about the state being dysfunctional and that we can t get anything right do you we can t you know we had so many issues with edd and and the dmv do you think we re really going to open a department that s going to house all of these people that are tracking us for what i said you already say we re incompetent there s no way in hell that we re going to be able to attract as many people so you know at this point people have already made up their mind and i can you know try to use logic as much as possible but it s still you know on one part of the brain is not connecting with the other they believe the rhetoric but when we try to talk about you know practical things like why would they track us why would folks track us and what would they get out of it and you know for what reason there s no answer so so they get offended and then they just stop the conversation and so it s really that conversation as well so when we go back to talking about how we reopen and how our businesses are doing some of them are opening and some of them are you know not they re afraid and so until we can get into a pattern of you know really um getting back uh folks back to work then we can make those businesses whole once the revenue starts coming in then you know our cities are going to start doing better because i told you we i have a majority of small businesses in my area well with 11 cities guess what they depend on they depend on that that revenue from those small businesses so the longer they stay shut down the longer that they re not going to be made whole i mean we can sit and talk about this for hours and hours and hours but i do have to say and i know it s not you know people are gonna talk about uh personal freedoms but i was in san francisco by the way on my spare time because you know i have nothing else to do i completed the san francisco half marathon uh a couple weeks ago so i was so thank you thank you um you know i have to do something for my sanity which i thought was really insane that i m using a 13 1 mile uh walk to be you know keep my sanity but that s a whole other conversation but when i was in san francisco i was not able to go to any of the eateries or any uh any places in san francisco without showing my vaccine card which i thought wow this is cool because we re not infringing upon anybody s rights if you know if that s what they re saying but you can t just go out to eat then if you don t have your vaccine so those are choices that folks need to make and at some point they need to make them but i really appreciated san francisco because they did not let me into an eatery unless i showed them my vaccine card and you know if you want to go eat out to eat you want to go to war you want to go somewhere if they if uh you want your life to to return then you show your vaccine card if you don t then you stay home not you know not vaccinated i don t know what answer we can give to folks but it s really hurting our businesses by you know having the stance for and against um the vaccine i think you know if we all do um the right thing for ourselves like if i don t want to do the vaccine and i know that s not what we were going to talk about but if i don t want to take that vaccine that s fine but i have two children i have a a a 14 year old and a 13 year old if anything happened to me i would not be able to to forgive myself because you know we were hearing about tragedies all over where children are being left orphaned because both parents are past again if you don t care about yourself don t get the vaccine but the consequences are if something happens to you you re leaving your children orphaned and i would not do that to my children and so i chose to vaccinate um you know to do that again i know this is not what we re talking about but i think it s important to have that conversation because it affects our businesses i can t open my businesses um fully because we have these breakout cases we have these you know little pockets of of of uh the kobit popping up because we re not doing what we re asked to do because for whatever reason anyway no that s well said and kind of talking with some people in the business community they re part of this kind of anti vaccine or they re worried about these mandates and i kind of you know go back to them as you put is is what s best for your business is for it to be open and for it to be open and and you know you know people have to get these vaccines and we have to you know empty these hospitals out so you know definitely definitely well put right well and then you know if i can add a little bit i ve got family members in kansas yes i have family in kansas and um uh i you know we re in conversations i lost an uncle to covered um in texas in last october um and just last week three of my family members um actually five three my aunt my niece and uh a cousin are hospitalized um because they were not vaccinating and then um some of the kids the kids around um the family members were sick now they were not hospitalized but they were home not not in school their home and uh one of my cousins is a nurse and she s kind of trying to hold the whole family that found part of the family in kansas together and she s devastated she says how can i you know make our family members understand that this is terrible and so as you can imagine in kansas the conversation is very different and some of them are democrats most the majority of my family members are democrats so it s not even you know a republican versus democrat it s about the information that s being spread through the news media through the news outlets i don t know how they depend on on facebook and all of the social media outlets to get their information but you know i talked to my brother and i said you know where are you getting your information from and he says oh well the news is saying it the neighbors and i said have you talked to a doctor and it was like no and i said well when you talk to a doctor call me back and then we can have this conversation because you know the news media is is is biased one way or the other i you know can t get into that but unless we do the research and talk to actual doctors and the doctors tell you don t do it then we can have that conversation but i guarantee you that if everybody listening goes that is anti the vaccine goes talk to an actual medical doctor they ll tell you the truth i i you know i engage on social media because i have to but i don t get my news from social media i don t get you know i talked to my doctor when i went to get vaccinated i was like what do you think they re like absolutely get vaccinated you know and again if you re not doing it for yourself do it for your children because if something happens to you you re going to leave um kids that are orphaned sorry i had to add that because you know if anybody s listening and thinks that i m not going through anything trust me my family members are going through it right now and and of course now that they re in the hospital they re like oh my god i should have gotten vaccinated well by then it s it s too late so don t don t let it be too late take care of your children by taking care of yourself definitely definitely uh so so this year we you know yet another interesting legislative session uh you know you were limited to what 12 bills yes so i guess how did you fare this year and how many you got sitting on the governor s desk waiting to be signed or already yeah so we re playing the odds um you know i ve gotten um i think i i have uh three signs so far i ve got another three uh sitting on the governor s desk and so so i i knew it was gonna happen you know if you have 12 if you do 50 you re good and so i ve gotten six of them on to the governor we re still waiting on a couple of them um to be signed but they were pretty pretty uh straightforward in my opinion i wanted to focus on you know cleaning up some legislation i do a lot of work on foster kids i do a lot of kids with a lot of work with um adults um seniors uh and so so i focused a lot of my legislation on you know kind of doing that kind of work especially right now because of kovitz some of our the most vulnerable communities are suffering and those are like our foster kids there are the the adults the seniors um adults with disabilities seniors so i did a lot of that um uh legislation and we re faring pretty well now i m really excited i think the you know a lot of our our um our effort went into trying to get um some wins uh in terms of the budget for our district so legislative wise i think i m preparing pretty well i m still you know crossing my fingers i m i it s kind of a cool process if you haven t been through it and once the the governor has the legislation on his desk the member gets a call prior to you know either the signature or the veto and so when you see the the the phone call from the governor s office um we re all like okay what is it gonna be you know which one is it and so i get the call and they tell us uh so far it s been three three good ones you know the the legislation has been signed and then i start texting my staff and we all start celebrating and but as soon as the governor s office number comes up we re like okay what do you think you know we start trying to figure out they call your seller they call the office myself they call the cell phone it s kind of cool so they call a cell phone and you know and they they usually if i don t pick up they ll leave a message but if i pick up they call and this is so and so from the governor s office wanted to let you know that um you know you whatever are you know ab um 650 for example is being signed um you know congratulations so it s really cool um the first year when i was here i was like who s this i didn t really answer the phone and then i was like oh this is what happens so now it s kind of a a cool uh thing you know when i m uh doing stuff and i see a call uh most of the time i will say it s like the governor s office but but when it s a 916 number i m like okay i have to answer it because it might be the governor s office so it s a kind of a little game it s kind of exciting but it s fun what are the last three bills you re waiting for uh for signature let s see i have to look because there were so many of them um let s see see i i have the ones that i have been signed i you are now you re making me look for the ones that have not been signed we don t memorize all of them what s happened sign okay all right let me tell you which ones have been signed all right so we ve got ab1243 was signed um 1243 is preventing isolation and financial abuse of vulnerable california so that s my senior bills so what was happening is if a a uh elderly person was in a in a home for example right um some there s always a primary caregiver and what was happening sometimes the families will get into a fight and the primary caregiver would not give access to those those folks that that they were fighting with and so so they had to file a restraining order it s the weirdest thing because you think the opposite but the family members that wanted to see their loved one have to file a restraining order in order to get access to their family members and they have to prove you know that their good intentions well what was happening and in a lot of cases obviously not all but the cases that i heard is the the family member that was in control was also taking advantage of that senior and you know uh getting credit on behalf of the senior getting money out on behalf of the senior so it s really elder abuse but but it was a difficult um conversation because the family members that want to help that member the the senior have to file a restraining order so anyway so so 1243 um helped streamline that for the family members that were were trying to see the fact the the elderly person and so they they now have access and the other party has to prove why not not the other way around it s a complicated one but it helps those those um elderly folks in homes that are being taken advantage of and helping the family members that want to see their loved one and so this one helped the other one that was signed was uh 1281 criminal protective orders um and so this is another kind of in my lane i do a lot of work with domestic violence victims and i m the the chair of the select committee on domestic violence so what was happening is um some of these these uh people that i i want to call in criminals look i m sorry but if you re abusing your spouse you re a criminal but a lot of these folks would go um and they have say a misdemeanor but they had a a uh protective order in place so they would get the the the misdemeanor expunged at some point right there s a way to do it and what was happening is once they expunged the the the crime or whatever the penalty was sometimes the the protective order would go with it and so my bill said okay you can expunge all you want but if there s a protective order you can t touch that you know the protective order remained intact because a lot of these were victims of domestic violence that had protective orders in place and um anyway so the protective orders were dropped and so my bill said you can expunge all you want but the protective orders um have to be maintained you have to talk to the victim to make sure that you re not we re not uh inadvertently dropping the protective orders along with the expungement of whatever the crime is right so so it it s separated both right you can still expunge but you have to maintain the protective order or at minimum talk to the victim to make sure that they are okay with you know with either dropping the protective order or continuing it so now it gives the victim the right to not um drop the protective order so they re again they re not sexy they re not hashtaggable uh uh bills but for me really important because you know we we have so many instances especially now and i i m sure you ve heard the statistics that during covet all of the domestic violence um cases increase uh uh domestic abuse not just for adults but for children sexual abuse uh have increased because now we re at home all the time and so these types of bills were really important to me because i want to make sure that we protect um folks now and as soon as we start getting out of the pandemic or kind of a more of a normal life you know that we re going to have a lot more cases so again they re not sexy hashtaggable um types of bills but for me really important because we re trying to protect as many people as possible exactly and and your last one was that 477 or 77 yes yes so 477 is the children advocacy center um so i do a lot of work with children advocacy centers i there s one that s near and dear to my heart excuse me near and dear to my heart in covina and you know unfortunately we have kids that are being abused so children advocacy centers what what their role is is they take the kids in they interview the children um they bring law enforcement they bring um uh the da s office in and counselors to so that they are present behind the wall behind the kind of the double sided mirrors so when the kids are telling their stories the the advent the advocate can you know record but there s uh what we call multi disciplinary teams intact so that they can listen in and the kids that have been abused don t when they go to court the kids don t have to testify now these teams can testify on their behalf so that the kids are not really traumatized and so for me again trying to protect kids trying to protect domestic violence um uh victims and also trying to protect the elderly so these the the children s advocacy center do amazing work and you know before i started in the legislature i didn t really know what that they existed and when i went to visit them i it was like wow it s trauma for the child but i cannot imagine even after being a teacher i cannot imagine having to listen to these stories from from children on on you know their abuse and so the children advocacy centers came to me and said we need this and i said absolutely i will do whatever i can to make sure that the advocacy centers are there taking care of our kids and that you know obviously the the teams again i said the police department the da s office uh we ve got uh social workers that are involved in this whole process and so the multi disciplinary teams are able to now collaborate and make sure that the kids are not re traumatized when when they go after the abusers yeah well bad so you know i guess you know the first year of a two year session obviously you i guess you had six bills that didn t make it uh you re kind of listening to the district listen to your staff kind of working in your package for next year kind of what what are some of the things you re already looking at for next year to kind of take a look at so so one of the bills that um that went to sleep that died um is still near and dear to my heart um so i want to work on uh what we did was i don t know if you knew but uh once upon a time before i came to the legislature um preschools were able to to expel three and four year olds okay so let me say that again preschools were expelling three and four year olds which as a teacher i can tell you three and four year olds are going to enjoy staying home music so we re basically reinforcing the the whatever behavior the they were being expelled for so when i came in i i saw that that three and four year olds were being expelled so i said uh no we i i couldn t believe that we had to write a bill but we had to write a bill that says that um if you re receiving any state money you may not expel three and four year olds because they re three and four um you know those of you that have children you know that that our kids go through different developmental stages and one of the stages that the kids go through is biting because they can t communicate they get frustrated because they can t communicate so a lot of these cases where the kids were being expelled for fighting well if you look at the you know developmental chart biting is part of the development for these children so anyway so i wrote a bill uh that was signed that said if you re receiving any money from um from state agencies are actually state preschools you may not uh expel uh preschool kids so then the following year i did a follow up bill that um i know some of my my uh you know the listeners are uh are thinking well how do you deal with problem children let me tell you how so the following year we did a bill to provide mental health uh consultation consultants to be able to help the student be able to help the parent and to support the teacher because i can tell you as a teacher i know how to teach the you know uh reading writing and arithmetic but i m not capable of trying to deal with some of the trauma that kids come in with and so so we did the bill and it was a success so now we have mental health consultations our consultants that go into the the preschool classroom they help the student with their issues they go to the home and help the parents and now the teachers are being provided um support so that they can also teach so the bill that that died was if now these are our state preschools the bill that died or is asleep right now we re going to bring it up next year it s sleeping it s taking a long nap i ll wake it up next year this is for um the the local preschools you know the the lady down the street that has her her the lady or gentleman down the street that they have their own little preschool program where they do daycare and preschool if now this bill was said if you are receiving any money from the state you have to comply basically with the non expansion expulsion of these kids look it sounds like it would be in my mind um i don t know a no brainer to make sure that kids are not expelled because you and i know that uh expelling kids doesn t do for them do doesn t do anything for them first and foremost they re not learning but number two we re reinforcing whatever behavior they were expelled for because now they re at home and they re thinking hey if i bite somebody i m gonna get to go home so so we re reinforcing those those uh those uh things that they were being excelled for so now the bill says that if you re receiving any kind of state money for preschool uh programs then um you may not expel the kids and again the hope is that we don t expel them and we want to get them some support so that the kids are not we can deal with the trauma that that is creating that behavior we can help the parents then we can help the preschool teachers be able to at least provide support for for the kids are coming in with some of these traumas so that s the bill that i m working on and then of course we have you know advocates for different issues that come to us and you know we get to pick really cool things or not um uh you know for me i try to do at least one that one two or three that are really dear to my heart and then you know we we talk to different stakeholders about um you know what they would like to see and so we engage in that matter but for right now my baby is going to be my key bill is going to be that preschool explosion program um though save the biters save the biters i like it hey you know what that is a good one save the biters because look and it s it s funny but it s but the thing is i i taught kindergarten first grade and fifth or fourth grade through my teaching career well guess what if the kids are not prepared in preschool i get to see them in in in kindergarten in first grade and if we don t save the biters now they re gonna be biters in kinder first second and and so on and so if we save them now then by the time i get you know kindergarten teachers get them and first grade teachers get them hopefully we have provided enough support that they re not biting anymore i like it save the biters exactly exactly you know you just kind of mentioned kind of like a lot of special interest lobbyists are are working on kind of their budget requests and their things for their clients right now kind of what what advice you have for i guess people looking to shop their ideas coming you know this this fall and winter uh you know how to present them and you know how i guess how how to get you know the best chance of you know getting a vehicle parked with someone early early um you know i think it s um i didn t understand the time you know the first year i was kind of oblivious to these timelines i was kind of just thrown in and you know you learn trial by fire right and now this is my fifth year and my best advice is early come in early um i uh assembly member cooper love him to death but he always puts a sign um the last two days of of of the bill deadline the introduction deadline and he says if you didn t see me before now don t come to me now because sometimes you know if you wait till the end you know we re either booked we ve you know we ve already uh exhausted our build limit or by then you know we re your last choice and it kind of doesn t feel good to be the last choice so so what i recommend is go in early number one but number two really think about i know we say that in in the craziness of a legislative year but really look at what members have focused on in the past and find and align your issues with those members i do a lot of work i like i said with foster kids i do a lot of work it s not sexy and hashtaggable so if you have a sexy bill call me first but the sexy and hashtag able bills um you know are are the ones that people tend to take on first and it s cool if you have one of those but i try to take on the bills that really make a difference in in kind of the areas that i ve been uh uh playing in and so find a legislator that aligns with that issue area and present them present it to them first now i know we all dabble in a whole bunch of of things because you know that s the nature of the game but really get to know the legislator and their legislation their key legislation and make sure you go to them first and talk about it now not in january january by then we re already you know getting ready for the crazy season but right now yes we re busy but it s a good opportunity to start talking to some of the legislators and say hey hey blanca rubio i know you work with uh you know a lot of the domestic violence issues can i talk to you about this bill or children advocacy center or you know i ve uh i did a cool budget request and i know you ll probably talk about that because we have to talk about it because it was a really a for me it was a big win but um we talked about food being medicine so one of my bills was about making food part of kind of the medi cal uh uh program fortunately for me the governor put it in the budget anyway so i i dropped the bill because you know it s in the budget anyway oh sorry but the being at home means the doggy is uh here what s his name but uh anyway and so look at the what the legislators uh her name is jackson hi girlfriend and i was not i was not a dog person ever ever but i have to give props to assemblywoman christina garcia she talked me into adopting a dog from spca because my daughter nadia wasn t gonna have a dog so we got jack c we adopted jacksie may 6 of 20 um 19 so jaxy is now my dog not my children s dog because of course i was like i m not gonna fall in love there s no way i don t love her yet so christina would check in a couple of times you know like hey do you love her yet i m like nope i like her but i don t love her so that went on and all of a sudden from one day to another she s my dog and i take her everywhere i m one of those annoying pet people that carries the dog in the car with wherever i go um she she follows me around in the morning and so again all of a sudden i m a pet person so thank you christina garcia for you know making me adopt a pet she completely has changed my view on on crazy pit people now i m one of those crazy pit people and i love it so and the dog is no longer my kid s dog she s mine and i adopted so i recommend that you adapt those dogs are and those pets that you adopt are so grateful that they have a home that they give you nothing but pure love and christina s going to make fun of me if she listens to this portion

that i ve had i ve been discriminated against it s hard to believe that my life was saved by solar train horn piano music not too long after my parents divorced my mom became a single mother which caused tension between the two of us i ran away a lot so that eventually led me to a group home and i eventually ran away from there too and that led me to the department of corrections which is where i got my first adult record i was about to be a felon i had charges pending that were really gonna limit my employment opportunities and i didn t know how to change it and didn t feel like i had the support that i needed to really get through that stage in my life so i signed up for jobs partnership at that local church jobs partnership helps people by training them to get jobs to get second third fourth fifth chances in life because rarely do people move up in a straight line in illinois entry level wages are about 10 an hour or about 20 000 a year that s poverty wages and so if we re going to move people out of poverty we have to find them jobs that pay better than that my life was uh a life of addiction criminal activity and failure i was a heroin addict and it came about as a young age i was arrested for possession and manufacture of heroin it destroyed not only myself but my family i would say that was just about the lowest point in my life and i realized that if i didn t change at that time that i was either going to the penitentiary for a long time or i would eventually die as an addict and that s not what i wanted to do my prayers were eventually answered when a program called jobs partnership came into the jail during a recruiting tour they all come out with no hope other than knowing that jobs partnership was there with them when they were in prison so now that they re out of prison and taking us up on the promise that we made that we were gonna be there to help them with these green energy jobs particularly solar jobs we re helping people get around 40 000 a year or better so that s the goal move people up out of the bottom into the middle class change the trajectory of their lives so they can buy houses get cars send their kids to college or trade school or whatever but it changes their vision of what they can accomplish with their lives the folks that typically get jobs in solar right now are cisgender white male under 35 men who have been in construction since they were young adults i work with a lot of black and brown folks in the community and our focus is on formerly incarcerated women specifically a solar training hub is like a direct line for a participant that goes through it to be hired on with a company in a clean energy job the skills that the solar hubs provide is everything from all the way up to that hands on training from what you ll be doing day to day at an actual job this opens the door to actually finding employment and being hired that last step once you have all these skills you re in an interview and they say what are your skills what do you do best you ll use this chart and say ok out of all of these these 5 are the ones i feel i m most good at and i use most frequently the folks that i work with are definitely discriminated against because of their background as soon as they start to do that background search or criminal history search no matter how many diplomas you have or how much experience you have you re immediately written off my community is dark we don t get a lot of information to success no type of career is offered for people like me when i first started with jobs partnership i really had my doubts i was like i don t know if this is really gonna work i actually started at a 3rd grade reading and math level but i still put my all into it every single day and it definitely paid off when i finished i had the highest grades out of the entire class installing solar makes me feel like a hero because i m actually doing something that helps the environment it doesn t even seem like a job it feels like you put on your cape you go out there you save the world these hubs should be everywhere because there are a lot of broken communities there are a lot of black communities and people who need jobs and this could help repair a lot of people s lives the future energy jobs act known as feja was really the start of the process it created a handful of job hubs but all that money s run out and so we need a new bill that s gonna move us to a clean energy economy by 2030 and get us off fossil fuels and that s called the clean energy jobs act ceja the fight to actually becoming a hub has been pretty rough just being completely honest the biggest barrier that we ve had is the fact that the clean energy job act focuses on black and brown communities and there are folks that feel like that s not a priority adding that extra piece that provides jobs to minorities isn t something that people are interested in we have essentially a 6 week window to get the clean energy jobs act through the illinois house it s going to come down to grassroots power grassroots and faith power to engage those legislative decision makers we re facing really a challenge by corporations that have more power than probably any single segment of society in the existence of humanity the big utility corporations they want to control and own the power generation and we re saying that that s just not gonna happen meeting folks in illinois people s action sent me on a road of community organizing finding that value and love in doing something chanting c e j a c ej a chanting c e j a c ej a i ve done canvassing with local organizations also met with representative dan brady so what we re asking you to do is not just to sign this new bill and agree with it but we re actually asking if you can co sponsor the clean energy jobs act are you willing to cosponsor the clean energy jobs act music this is 2021 we have to stand up so whether you re a legislator or whether you re a community member we have to be called to action because enough is enough i want to be able to say to people on the southeast side that you can breathe the air you can drink the water you can play in the park everyone deserves that no matter where you live ceja is a core part of redefining what it means to thrive in 21st century illinois my son he looks at me as being a real dad now a responsible man a respected man and i m also a grandfather and they haven t seen any of the addiction all they have seen is papa is going to meetings papa is going to work papa is always in church my kids are very proud of their father my kids are very proud of their father if the clean energy jobs act bill passes it would be a very overwhelming moment for me i m excited to get that started like i m almost jumping outta my seat i can t wait i d probably laugh at you because i was scared of heights laughs so when i first got on the roof i was nervous the ladder was really my challenge because you have to swing your foot over the ladder to get down so you have to hang off the edge of the roof for a tiny second and that was kinda scary but when i stepped on the roof that s when i knew that this is something i want to do for the rest of my life,"black,fossil,addiction,heroin,middle class,school,environment,fossil fuels,legislator,prison,criminal,college,black
