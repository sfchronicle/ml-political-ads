before was like a train wreck is the best way i can describe it i was not the person that god meant me to be and i had nothing i pretty much had every single job you could think of and in every job that i ve had i ve been discriminated against it s hard to believe that my life was saved by solar train horn piano music not too long after my parents divorced my mom became a single mother which caused tension between the two of us i ran away a lot so that eventually led me to a group home and i eventually ran away from there too and that led me to the department of corrections which is where i got my first adult record i was about to be a felon i had charges pending that were really gonna limit my employment opportunities and i didn t know how to change it and didn t feel like i had the support that i needed to really get through that stage in my life so i signed up for jobs partnership at that local church jobs partnership helps people by training them to get jobs to get second third fourth fifth chances in life because rarely do people move up in a straight line in illinois entry level wages are about 10 an hour or about 20 000 a year that s poverty wages and so if we re going to move people out of poverty we have to find them jobs that pay better than that my life was uh a life of addiction criminal activity and failure i was a heroin addict and it came about as a young age i was arrested for possession and manufacture of heroin it destroyed not only myself but my family i would say that was just about the lowest point in my life and i realized that if i didn t change at that time that i was either going to the penitentiary for a long time or i would eventually die as an addict and that s not what i wanted to do my prayers were eventually answered when a program called jobs partnership came into the jail during a recruiting tour they all come out with no hope other than knowing that jobs partnership was there with them when they were in prison so now that they re out of prison and taking us up on the promise that we made that we were gonna be there to help them with these green energy jobs particularly solar jobs we re helping people get around 40 000 a year or better so that s the goal move people up out of the bottom into the middle class change the trajectory of their lives so they can buy houses get cars send their kids to college or trade school or whatever but it changes their vision of what they can accomplish with their lives the folks that typically get jobs in solar right now are cisgender white male under 35 men who have been in construction since they were young adults i work with a lot of black and brown folks in the community and our focus is on formerly incarcerated women specifically a solar training hub is like a direct line for a participant that goes through it to be hired on with a company in a clean energy job the skills that the solar hubs provide is everything from all the way up to that hands on training from what you ll be doing day to day at an actual job this opens the door to actually finding employment and being hired that last step once you have all these skills you re in an interview and they say what are your skills what do you do best you ll use this chart and say ok out of all of these these 5 are the ones i feel i m most good at and i use most frequently the folks that i work with are definitely discriminated against because of their background as soon as they start to do that background search or criminal history search no matter how many diplomas you have or how much experience you have you re immediately written off my community is dark we don t get a lot of information to success no type of career is offered for people like me when i first started with jobs partnership i really had my doubts i was like i don t know if this is really gonna work i actually started at a 3rd grade reading and math level but i still put my all into it every single day and it definitely paid off when i finished i had the highest grades out of the entire class installing solar makes me feel like a hero because i m actually doing something that helps the environment it doesn t even seem like a job it feels like you put on your cape you go out there you save the world these hubs should be everywhere because there are a lot of broken communities there are a lot of black communities and people who need jobs and this could help repair a lot of people s lives the future energy jobs act known as feja was really the start of the process it created a handful of job hubs but all that money s run out and so we need a new bill that s gonna move us to a clean energy economy by 2030 and get us off fossil fuels and that s called the clean energy jobs act ceja the fight to actually becoming a hub has been pretty rough just being completely honest the biggest barrier that we ve had is the fact that the clean energy job act focuses on black and brown communities and there are folks that feel like that s not a priority adding that extra piece that provides jobs to minorities isn t something that people are interested in we have essentially a 6 week window to get the clean energy jobs act through the illinois house it s going to come down to grassroots power grassroots and faith power to engage those legislative decision makers we re facing really a challenge by corporations that have more power than probably any single segment of society in the existence of humanity the big utility corporations they want to control and own the power generation and we re saying that that s just not gonna happen meeting folks in illinois people s action sent me on a road of community organizing finding that value and love in doing something chanting c e j a c ej a chanting c e j a c ej a i ve done canvassing with local organizations also met with representative dan brady so what we re asking you to do is not just to sign this new bill and agree with it but we re actually asking if you can co sponsor the clean energy jobs act are you willing to cosponsor the clean energy jobs act music this is 2021 we have to stand up so whether you re a legislator or whether you re a community member we have to be called to action because enough is enough i want to be able to say to people on the southeast side that you can breathe the air you can drink the water you can play in the park everyone deserves that no matter where you live ceja is a core part of redefining what it means to thrive in 21st century illinois my son he looks at me as being a real dad now a responsible man a respected man and i m also a grandfather and they haven t seen any of the addiction all they have seen is papa is going to meetings papa is going to work papa is always in church my kids are very proud of their father my kids are very proud of their father if the clean energy jobs act bill passes it would be a very overwhelming moment for me i m excited to get that started like i m almost jumping outta my seat i can t wait i d probably laugh at you because i was scared of heights laughs so when i first got on the roof i was nervous the ladder was really my challenge because you have to swing your foot over the ladder to get down so you have to hang off the edge of the roof for a tiny second and that was kinda scary but when i stepped on the roof that s

happening downstairs i ve got 150 plus people here from the dfw metroplex some crypto education classes bitcoin 101 d5 taproot upgrade for more of the advanced audience but we stepped away for a minute just to talk about um the policy process in texas and why texas needs to be a leader in this space so representative harris you ve been in the legislature you served for for a number of years now and um you guys are are beginning to think about 2023 when the legislature comes back in in january so tell tell the audience a little bit about first of all why texas needs to lead in this space what can what can this industry do for the state of texas and why why you re here tonight what what has caught your attention about this space absolutely you know as you said looking forward to 2023 when the legislature goes back into its regular session we re poised to really take a a lead both nationally and worldwide uh on blockchain and cryptocurrency policy uh you know i m a guy from a town of 18 000 people so what am i doing up here in dallas at a at a blockchain convention well in in studying and looking into the whole industry i m wholly convinced that blockchain blockchain technology is here to stay cryptocurrency is here to stay um and i really believe we re just at the infancy of the entire industry and so you know as texans we pride ourselves on being uh you know the wild west gunslingers and that that s kind of we have that opportunity again to go out there and lead on this entire industry you know we ve been known as the oil and gas state uh you know so many different areas that we ve led in and as as leaders of the state we re constantly looking for areas to grow our portfolio for lack of a better word you know we never want to be in the situation that we were in the 80s when the oil and gas market tanked and the entire texas economy tanked right you know i m i m wholly convinced that that blockchain and cryptocurrency are um one of the main ways that we can protect against that again it s coming we need to be the ones at the forefront leading the world and setting the standard for how to do this well incorrectly i love it so i ve talked to one of your colleagues in the house uh representative cabriglione about this idea and i won t ask for a comment from you today i just kind of get your thoughts on the broader ecosystem so he and i have talked about potentially tokenizing the texas gold bullion depository so you know several years ago some of your colleagues passed some legislation i m assuming you voted for it if you didn t you could not tell the audience of course i did jio was the author yes yes i m sure you did i i wouldn t assume that so so we brought some gold to texas that we were paying new york to custody for us paying them a lot of money and we built a a bullion depository there in leander texas just north of austin what would it look like if texas were to be able to tokenize actually the governor we ve mentioned this to the governor before and he got kind of excited about it of course he doesn t make that kind of policy he signs it once you guys write it he signs it into law um it may not even take uh legislative action but i think it actually would as we dive into the policy to be able to tokenize that gold and have it be uh a texas coin traded on as a as a cryptocurrency but backed by gold the gold in the texas bullying deposits you and i haven t visited about this yet this first i ve heard of the idea and i absolutely love it i mean yes that s fantastic absolutely well i wasn t even looking for that comment i was just kind of broaching the the subject i think uh giovanni s excited about it we ll continue the conversation here s another question for you so talk speak to why this could be a bipartisan topic i mean we were just talking a few minutes ago about um you know the federal dc is broken right there s a lot of dissension polarization the texas legislature still gets things done and there s there s just some disagreements we ve seen that you know this last session but on things like this when it comes to communities flourishing jobs there s a lot of agreement between the r s and the d s that s right what the media portrays is that it s this constant right versus left battle um and that s true in a lot of cases but in reality i d say the majority you know we look at 4 000 bills a session yeah the majority of what we re seeing is an urban versus rural fight where it s left it s it s less of a left versus right fight so that s you know water policy flood mitigation infrastructure roads banking regulation go on down the list where it s not a heavy partisan issue that we re debating and it s been a while since we ve seen something new at the table that is truly nonpartisan and like you and i were talking about earlier this is entirely a non partisan issue it s something that we can all come together and say this is what s best for not only the state of texas but every single citizen in the state of texas and we ve got a lead on it let s do it i love it representative harris thanks for being here for having me appreciate

seeing around the country is already the groundwork being laid to essentially have a coup so a redistricting frenzy is underway across the country it is map makers and politicians picking their voters rather than the other way around fewer people are aligning with the gop s platform and so in order for them to hold on to power they re going to cheat it wouldn t have to be a violent cool it would be a coup by legislative process music over the past 10 years texas gained about 4 million people in total population 95 of that population was people of color despite people of color fueling the growth over the past decade there were no new majority minority districts drawn in either the state senate the state house or the congressional map and in fact both committees made an effort to reduce the number of majority minority districts on all three levels there was a particular attention to a district just north of austin in a county called bell county that is home to a sizable black population and in this county we had two districts placed within its boundaries that looked like a donut there was the outer ring district and then there was the inner district that basically worked to cut up the population of the two biggest cities within that county basically ensuring that people of color in that county could not elect candidates of their choice some of the worst districts were in the greater houston area and into the houston suburbs and fort bend county in particular congressional district 7 take part of populations in harris county and then also cut up the aapi communities that have grown tremendously there over the past 10 years because of these maps that don t accurately reflect texans and their values we get a legislature that is passing laws that are not favorable with the people of texas and this includes senate bill 8 known as the texas heartbeat law bans almost all abortions in the state the texas bill is unique permitting almost anyone to sue any person or provider who may have helped someone get an abortion after the limit north carolina is really a true 50 50 state roy cooper who s our democratic governor won reelection by 51 the same election where trump won the state really all the statewide elections you see are right down the line we would hopefully expect that our state you know politics that our congressional members would reflect that but but they don t because of because of gerrymandering in the maps that just got passed the communities that are being targeted to dilute their representation are all urban communities they re all the places where communities of color are you know they re taking places like greensboro it s a growing town it s our third largest city has a very large historical black population that city is basically being scooped out of its county and paired with really rural mountain counties that are very far away have very different interests and are demographically very different even if democrats are winning more than 50 percent of the votes they re still ending up in the minority in our state legislature and our state legislature is deciding all these really impactful things i mean we re still one of the few states that hasn t expanded medicaid it s something that the vast majority of north carolinians want it would give health coverage to 500 600 000 people in our state who really really need it there s this just huge mismatch between what the people of the state actually want what they ve actually voted for and what they get georgia has 14 congressional districts and under the map that was passed republicans have between nine and ten of those seats which is really remarkable in a state that is one of the quintessential battlegrounds right now georgia is very much a 50 50 state almost evenly down the line what we saw last decade is the emergence of an increasingly diverse multi racial georgia tech gwinnett county for example which is in the suburbs of atlanta you know in 1990 gwinnett county was 90 white it s only 30 white today and yet that is not at all being recognized in the maps that the georgia legislature passed in the atlanta suburbs michelle al is the first chinese american woman elected to the georgia state senate her district is about 62 percent non white and in redistricting it s transformed to a district that s 52 percent white it goes from being a biden district to a trump district in ohio on the congressional map there are 15 congressional districts republicans are favored to win 12 of those in any given year democrats only three which is wildly skewed in fact you know that s about 80 percent of seats in a state where republicans at most win about 53 percent of the vote music we have reintroduced hr4 the john robert lewis voting rights advancement act hr4 will create a new coverage formula to determine which states have been the most egregious actors and subject them to pre clearance that is based on a current evidence of voter discrimination the freedom to vote act will improve access to the ballot by setting national standards for absentee voting early voting and in person voting this bill will end partisan gerrymandering
