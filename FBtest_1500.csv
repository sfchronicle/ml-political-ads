"President Obama called Elizabeth “one of the country’s fiercest advocates for the middle class.” After the big banks crashed our economy in 2008, Elizabeth had the political courage, original thinking, and persistence to call for a new agency to fight for consumers.

That agency has now returned $12 billion to people who were cheated by big banks and other financial firms.

"Every one of the Democratic candidates remaining would make a better president than Donald Trump. But the race for the Democratic nomination is a fractured one. It's not a straightforward narrative captured by glancing at a map, and the process won't be decided by the simple horse race numbers in clickbait headlines. That's never been our focus — our focus is on building a broad coalition to win delegates everywhere.

For months, Elizabeth has been near or at the top of the list of candidates that voters are considering for president. According to the latest Economist/YouGov poll, 40-50% of voters across all age groups are considering voting for Warren, including 58% of self-described liberals and 38% of self-described moderates. Elizabeth is best positioned to unite the party and lead the Democratic ticket to defeat Donald Trump.

Our campaign is no stranger to being written off or counted out early. But here's what we do know: Elizabeth has proven the doubters wrong before.

Elizabeth is progressive, effective, and has lived a life that has prepared her for this fight. With a strong organization of more than 1,000 staff on the ground in 31 states, bolstered by a movement of more than 1,000,000 grassroots donors, we are confident that as Americans continue to get to know Elizabeth, they'll see what we see every day: Elizabeth is the only candidate who can unite the party and defeat Donald Trump in November.

"“She came up with an idea for a new, independent agency standing up for consumers and middle class families. She’s done it while facing some very tough opposition. Fortunately, she’s very tough.” –President Barack Obama

That agency has now returned $12 billion to people who were cheated by big banks and other financial firms.

"As I travel the country talking to workers at town halls and in selfie lines, I hear that too many face a giant challenge in supporting their families: unpredictable work schedules that leave them with too few hours to afford necessities and no control over their time. 

Across the country, workers are fed up with unpredictable and unfair schedules so they’re getting organized - and winning.

My Fair Workweek plan builds on the work of these committed advocates and activists, and ensures that every part-time worker in America is treated with respect and can build a future for themselves and the people they love. It will: 
- Require employers with 15 or more employees to give two weeks of advance notice of work schedules
- Empower employees to ask for schedules that work for them without fear of retaliation.
- Ensure a right to rest between shifts.
- Require employers to offer additional work hours to existing, qualified, part-time workers before hiring new employees or contractors.
- Provide benefits to part-time workers.

"I think Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are entirely correct to advocate for universal healthcare (although I don't agree with their specific plans) and the other candidates advocating for a ""public option"" are not being ambitious enough on healthcare.  We need universal healthcare.  Our healthcare system is largely broken. Costs are very high, quality is uneven and many don't have coverage or they have inadequate coverage. The right goal is to have universal coverage. By universal coverage I mean that every citizen is provided federal healthcare coverage for free. Most developed nations have a system that does this. I have a plan to do that as does Bernie Sanders and 
Elizabeth Warren. To my mind healthcare is a human right and we can only control costs & improve quality if we get everyone covered.  Others who are running are proposing a ""public option.""  A public option is a government run insurance company. It will have premiums, co pays, deductibles etc. A public option is ""fine"" in the same way that any incremental improvement is ""fine"" but it doesn't solve the problem. Where I differ with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren is on the form of universal healthcare. They are proposing a single payer system, which very few countries have. My universal healthcare plan is a ""mixed model"" like most developed countries have, including Germany and France. Everyone gets covered for free but they can ""opt out"" & have other insurance options. The reason I like a ""mixed model"" is because I believe it is better policy. A mixed model is easier to finance (since you don't have to change the whole system), it gives people choices (which they like) and it has shown to produce higher quality healthcare. Bottom line, I'm closer to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on healthcare than I am to the others.","health, social programs"

"Paintings like this remind us of the glory of childhood, yet childhood is far from glorious for millions and millions of children in this country and around the world. Protecting our children should be a national priority, yet among other things the United States is number two in the world for hosting child pornography websites. In the last year alone, tech companies reported 45 million impressions of online sexual and violent abuse against children. Our federal authorities know about it, yet only half the $60 million appropriated to stop it has been allocated to the effort. Without the proper funding, efforts are limited and stymied. We must rise up and shout about this. Many times people say “I don’t even want to know about those things because there’s nothing I can do and it just makes me depressed.” But it’s actually the opposite. Power goes where attention goes. Know about such things in order to talk about them in order to change them. Children have no capacity to defend themselves from abuse; it’s our moral and civic responsibility to do for them what they cannot do for themselves. There should be a public outcry about it, a demand that the fight against online abuse of children be properly funded and vigorously pursued. I think women are key here; we should be leading the charge. Given our numbers, American women could and should be a moral force for good. We have tremendous power that we’re not yet using, and number one should be the health and safety of children here and elsewhere. We should be fierce on their behalf, from safety to health to education to freedom. That’s central to my campaign for the presidency.
