84,in case you missed it california lawmakers nazarian and lee influenced by animal extremist groups california lawmakers introduce legislation against animal feeding operations and processing facilities on february 18 2022 california state assembly members nazarian and lee introduced ab 2764 if passed this bill will ban new animal feeding operations and processing in the state of california the legislation will also prohibit feeding operations and processing plants from expanding to meet demand for nutritious animal protein products if made into law this would add chapter 4 to part 1 of division 9 of the food and agricultural code relating to animals this bill was pushed by radical animal extremist groups direct action everywhere dxe and compassionate bay via their nomorefactoryfarms campaign dxe celebrates the radical animal extremist group dxe celebrated the introduction of ab 2764 with a social media post dxe is a group well known for its animal liberation ideology and agenda the group has factions across the country where they stage and perform protests thefts of animals and mob farm invasions recently the group s founder wayne hsuing was found guilty of trespass and theft adrin nazarian nazarian is a california state assembly member representing the 46th district this district covers the san fernando valley and includes hollywood hills lake balboa north hills north hollywood panorama city sherman oaks studio city toluca lake valley glen universal city van nuys and valley village his bio on his official website shows that he has a degree in economics therefore he clearly understands the impact this legislation will have on lawful businesses in the state that help to feed his own constituents based on numerous articles about nazarian and his activities is it clear is has aligned and created a strong partnership with radical animal extremist groups like dxe physicians committee for responsible medicine prcm animal hope in legislation animal legal defense fund friends of the earth social compassion in legislation and sierra club california he has also received endorsements from jerry brown and kamala harris who have also pushed legislation that is harmful to rural america rural property owners and animal agriculture his endorsements also include a long list of hollywood actors known for their affiliations with radical animal extremist groups vegan school lunches nazarian also authored ab 558 a bill that impacts school lunches which was pushed by the radical animal extremist group physicians committee for responsible medicine according to an article in businesswire the bill incentivizes k 12 public schools across the state to offer healthier climate friendly plant based meals and beverages ab 558 passed the california assembly courtroom advocates for animals furthermore nazarian introduced ab 2645 last year which may be heard in committee in march 2022 if passed ab 2645 would allow judges to appoint courtroom advocates to animals this is highly problematic as it provides an opening to providing personhood for animals the ramifications of this are multifold the american veterinary medical association has this bill on its watch list with the following statement the avma will keep a close eye on whether legislation allows for a court to appoint an advocate utilizing the legal standard of in the interests of the animal involved versus the standard of the interests of justice in the interest of the animal is a different legal standard than in the interest of justice and they have very different implications in the interest of justice includes notions of fairness societal interests for the humane treatment of animals and the interest of the owner while in the interest of the animal is an attempt to require courts to apply the same types of standards as they would for a child alex lee alex lee represents california s 25th assembly district his district covers both alameda and santa clara counties it includes the communities of fremont newark milpitas san jose and santa clara assembly member lee was elected in 2020 and has called the san francisco bay area home his entire life lee was also endorsed by the sierra club and his campaign website states he is fighting for enacting the green new deal and building sustainable communities his activities show partnership with extremist groups like peace 4 animals friends of the earth and social compassion in legislation for animals lee authored house resolution 61 which alarmingly refers to animal owners as guardians the american veterinary medical board addressed this very concern in 2005 this is a small portion of avma s stance some animal owners may like to refer to themselves as pet guardians however guardian is a legal term that has significant legal implications and repercussions its use to describe the relationship between animals and their owners is inappropriate under well developed principles of guardianship law guardianship is a fiduciary relationship the highest legal civil duty owed by one person to another the ward s interests are always to prevail over those of the guardian some conflicts that arise from application of human guardianship law to animals are described in the text that follows on the basis of these conflicts the american veterinary medical association avma recommends that guardian not be adopted even to semantically describe the relationship between humans and their animals the american kennel club expressed concerns about hr 61 and stated contact the author assembly member alex lee and respectfully express your concerns with hr 61 let him know that you agree that all animals should be treated in a humane and safe manner and explain how the broad definitions in hr 61 could encompass procedures that are important for your dogs breed why are two california assembly members who clearly have no background in agriculture and who represent urban and suburban communities writing legislation that will impact agriculture and rural communities summary of ab 2764 this bill would prohibit commercial animal feeding operations and slaughterhouses as

85,here are some of the ways propane is a cleaner and greener alternative to electricity,,facebook
86,in case you ve missed this the dangers of food elitism by jaclyn krymowski for protect the harvest access to adequate food is an extremely important topic all people deserve to have access to safe and nutritious foods in today s society there are numerous questions to ask about food food security and the recent focus on elite foods are various food focused social justice initiatives really pushing towards the goal of safe nutritious foods or are they working to redefine what safe and nutritious means do the groups who are trying to make safe and nutritious simultaneous with buzzwords like organic plant based and all natural know what impact their actions have on food equity food bullying is a reality and it starts with food marketers and their counterparts animal and environmental extremists in her book food bullying author michele payn points out that people may find themselves selecting certain food products or labels because of how it will make them feel increase their status or earn praise from peers the choices they make aren t necessarily derived from nutrition or safety but from an elitist mindset we support all forms of agriculture we do not support misinforming the public there is nothing wrong with providing high quality products to the elite buyer we support organic farming and conventional farming we also support different types of animal production systems what we do not support and believe is morally wrong is the practice of misinforming the public about our food system and the nutritional value of the foods they can afford to provide their families why are we making the statement that these groups are partners in crime many of these elite food marketing groups and companies tap into the false narrative established by animal and environmental extremist groups to push their own products elitist marketers and their counterparts animal and environmental extremist groups have purposely overlooked and ignored the reality that our modern food systems provide safe nutritious humane and most importantly affordable food through their marketing they repeat the negative disinformation about modern agriculture propagated by animal and environmental extremist groups keep in mind that animal extremists want to end all animal agriculture and view animal ownership as akin to slavery and abuse environmental extremist groups view humankind as a global parasite and they have been pushing this narrative for years this provides a convenient already established narrative that elite food companies and marketers tap into animal and environmental extremist groups are in a sense saving elite food marketers money since they have already worked to establish a false narrative in which they can use it as a platform to sell their food products they use the false narrative designed and marketed by extremist groups to enforce the false notion that vegan and other elite foods are the epitome of good health what is worse is that marketers for elite foods frown upon families who choose products they deem are over processed or unhealthy not only are these accusations unfounded but those same families simply don t have the money to spend on expensive alternatives without affordable animal protein products like eggs dairy beef pork and poultry they d have no other choice but to go hungry veganism is elitist and unhealthy one of the dangers of the vegan animal extremist ideology is their insistence that their proposed diet is suitable for everyone and entirely natural they ignore the facts and put the health of people at risk in favor of their radical ideology animal extremist groups also ignore the stark reality that the animal extremist vegan lifestyle requires some degree of supplementation to meet lacking nutrients found in abundance in animal products like b12 iron and vitamin d to name a few additionally vegan meat and dairy substitute products like fake bacon processed pea patties fake cheese and juices that are supposed to replace milk are significantly more expensive compared to wholesome real meat and dairy products if those manipulated into following the vegan ideology cannot afford those products they are then only able to afford produce and grain staples from a health perspective vegan diets are not recommended for everyone physicians from all over the world have warned against the dangers of vegan diets in children citing multiple instances of malnutrition and average delayed growth patterns in some countries forcing children to eat a vegan diet is considered child abuse and a crime food elitism is not family friendly unfortunately years of plentiful eating have blinded a lot of the elite to the fact that so many under privileged families rely on our affordable and sustainable food system the trend of companies serving the elite and wealthy have taken advantage of this ignorance in their marketing tactics most people cannot afford to shop at high end grocery stores like whole foods trader joe s and types of farmers markets on average their groceries are about 20 more expensive compared to traditional stores reflecting a privilege of the elite class examples of nefarious marketing tactics which mislead the public nefarious food product marketing tactics take many forms many marketing firms and elite food companies use scare tactics to sell their products using false or exaggerated disinformation their messaging heavily implies that other foods are nutritionally inferior and unsafe compared to certain products that are produced the right way of course the right way is their way their marketing messaging fully ignores the facts about food safety and the usda s role in ensuring the food items people purchase are safe to consume what these marketing tactics don t tell people is that conventionally raised meat eggs and dairy fall under the safest food inspections and regulations in the world likewise they have a very similar nutritional profile to food items which are marketed as pastured raised or organic these scare tactics can be especially harmful to low income and underprivileged families who are led to believe that they are not and cannot feed their families properly cooks venture is an example of elitist marketing and pricing they are a food delivery service focused on pasture raised beef and chicken they have plans to expand their lineup soon a 9 to 10 pound box of their assorted beef and chicken cuts goes for 149 99 by comparison the average cost per pound of a conventional whole chicken is just 1 70 and beef 4 73 good food is vital for health and happiness says their website heavily implying that their meats are good compared to other conventionally raised products the site continues despite the pastoral images and marketing claims almost all meat today comes from mainstream operations that are labeled with greenwashed buzzwords finding food that is good for both us and the planet doesn t have to be this hard while marketing language this tone is harmful as it reinforces a misconception that is already so rampant among consumers that products derived from conventional animal agriculture are inferior to niche products sporting labels like grass fed pasture raised organic or all natural keep in mind that the definitions for some of these are not even officially defined a company with a similar marketing approach is butcherbox which says it was started with the idea that everyone should have access to high quality humanely raised meat but is their 149 month delivered box if 9 to 14 pounds of meat really accessible to everyone we only work with companies and farmers that are dedicated to doing the right thing continues the website never cutting corners this is yet another example of a company which is painting conventional modern animal agriculture as the enemy the goal is to shame the elite into purchasing their products and it fully ignores those who cannot afford the high end products they are pushing food insecurity is the real issue despite being one of the wealthiest nations in the world americans still fall into the food insecure category making up about 10 5 of households in 2019 according to data from the department of agriculture in poorer countries that number is much higher with some having notable portions of their populations being chronically malnourished a pivotal solution to all of this starts of course at the farm level however the disconnect between large farms modernization and food equity is unfortunately ongoing a global washington article cites increasing farm efficiency productivity as being necessary to help alleviate the rising cost of food products this includes a comprehensive approach that includes access to heartier seeds more effective tools improved farm management practices locally relevant knowledge and reliable markets university researchers and livestock veterinarians have dedicated decades to refining modern farming practices to provide humane sustainable wholesome and affordable foods large farms especially those in first world countries have embraced the research available to them and implemented modern practices unfortunately the global washington article leaves out the vital role of research and modern farming practices instead it cites small farms without defining what that term means as being part of the solution diane sullivan fights for food security in her testimony before the u s house subcommittee on economic and consumer policy on february 6 2020 food security activist diane sullivan shared her insight into the real world implications of food elitism as a mother who has experienced hunger and homelessness too often food policy debate in this country exclusively takes place among those in power elected officials scholars researchers both for profit and non profit special interest groups and more she shared rarely are those of us with lived experience in hunger invited to the table when the policies that directly impact our lives are discussed designed and implemented this is increasingly the case as retailers policymakers state ballot initiatives and more press to regulate farmers in such a way that eliminates affordable safe and nutritious food choices and drives up the cost of our food sullivan also commented on the significant role that hardworking farmers and ranchers play in the conventional food system to make food equitable to struggling households my experience has taught me that productive farmers and ranchers in this country are perhaps among the best friends low income people could have she stated they provide us the broadest choices of safe and affordable food options in the world so long as they are permitted to do so as low income consumers we remain stuck in the middle of policies that increase the cost of our food in 2016 sullivan was the campaign manager for a ballot committee that opposed a ban on sales of meat and eggs from animals raised in large modern farms mass question 3 which is the vast majority of affordable and conventionally raised animal products on so many occasions i ve been in a position where i haven t been able to feed my children an appropriate meal sullivan shared in an interview for a local publication when my snap benefits have run out my paycheck is still a couple of days away i ve been able to go to the grocery store gather up a dollar in change purchase a dozen eggs and feed my children at least a source of protein she added my passion is driving me i know what hunger looks and feels like who s going to take on an organization like the humane society of the united states to defend poor people poor people are too often voiceless the farm systems reform act will drive up the price of affordable food in addition to recent attacks on affordable food and modern agriculture like mass question 3 and california s prop 2 and prop 12 there are animal extremist influenced politicians continuing to push their ideology while ignoring the impact on american families considering the average spending of an american family on their monthly grocery bill and that many are still going hungry the disruption of the conventional food system particularly animal derived proteins would be catastrophic the farm systems reform act is one of the latest legislative efforts being pushed by vegan extremist senator cory booker this piece of legislation will harm families in the name of food elitism and vegan ideology and it is being done on the national level animal extremist driven state ballot initiatives will drive up the price of affordable food in addition to federal legislation the animal extremist driven state ballot initiatives in colorado and oregon are other new targeted attacks on animal agriculture by animal rights vegan extremists they are pushing to eliminate animal protein products from the diets of citizens in those states under a false animal welfare pretense these initiatives would cripple the states animal industries and force an unhealthy diet on growing families by making affordable and nutritious animal protein products prohibitively expensive a balanced food system each year hundreds of millions of people go hungry around the globe and even for those with access to food many are still deficient in essential vitamins and nutrients in the u s alone it is estimated over 92 of the population suffers from at least one vitamin or mineral deficiency at least 10 have a broader type of nutritional deficiency many of the most common deficiencies found throughout the world can be easily addressed by consuming animal protein products iron deficiency for example affects over 25 of the world a single three ounce serving of ground beef one of the most affordable beef products covers almost 30 of the recommended daily value for iron because vitamin b12 absorption decreases with age many older adults an estimated 20 of them are deficient in this vitamin meat milk and eggs are all abundant accessible sources these are just a few brief examples of vitamins that are essential and found easily in animal products modern agriculture provides affordable nutritious and sustainable food modern agriculture including livestock production makes food affordable is more sustainable helps to control food byproduct waste and decreases food disparity among households americans today only spend less than 10 of their income on food for poorer nations and low income american households that percentage is easily 40 in some cases much more than that modern state of the art practices in american agriculture have been developed to feed citizens efficiently and affordably everything in our food system from research to farming practices to subsidies all reflect this mindset not only are nutritious foods plentiful and accessible but they also empower consumers with freedom of choice the pursuit of an equitable food system should be about offering more not less choices to consumers to meet their dietary needs restricting them with only expensive alternatives is food elitism that leaves so many vulnerable families to struggle with life s most basic necessities for links to sources and more information visit this article on our website,Karen Elizabeth Glueck,facebook

111,surveys have found that less than 5 of marijuana businesses today are owned by black americans even in states with social equity programs like california that s because starting any business requires money upfront to pay for security consultants equipment and rent while dealing with investors and incubators doing their best to fleece applicants that means these businesses are started by people who already have access to the necessary resources if we are serious about helping poor and working class americans we must do the much harder task of taking on our economic elites and making sure they aren t the only ones to benefit from legalization that s why i support nationalizing the marijuana industry legal sales of marijuana are expected to exceed 43 billion by the end of 2025 that is with weed being illegal in many states even in states where it is legal illicit sales still make up a significant part of all sales a nationalized industry would bring in billions in revenue to pay for much needed social services services that would actually lift millions of americans out of poverty and deliver real material benefits to people s lives we can prioritize jobs in the industry to go to nonviolent drug offenders we could contract growing cooperatives that are worker run and worker owned we can make sure a substance that was used to terrorize and ruin the lives of so many of our sisters and brothers will now be used to better their lives instead if we don t we risk marijuana just being used by the rich to get even richer,CHIMA FOR CONGRESS,facebook

118,although city council elections here in irvine are nonpartisan by law mayor farrah khan runs her campaigns as a partisan democrat however it appears that khan is facing increasing opposition from local democrats in fact just last month the local democratic club in irvine overwhelmingly voted not to provide an early endorsement for her november mayoral re election campaign khan received less than 25 support from democratic club members in irvine before the vote was taken irvine democratic activists who had campaigned donated and voted for khan in 2020 rattled off a number of instances where the mayor had defied the democratic party s core values including 1 as mayor khan has instituted the rule of two which directly contradicts a resolution passed by the democratic party of orange county mandating that elected democrats provide a second to any agenda item submitted by a fellow democrat 2 khan blocked council discussion on district elections even though district elections are part of the california democratic party s platform 3 the mayor attempted to dismantle the city s transparency focused sunshine ordinance by limiting public notification of council agendas and moving public comments at council meetings to the very end when the council chamber is basically empty after public outcry khan was forced to move public comments to the beginning of meetings 4 in 2020 khan promised veterans and their families that she would honor the citizens initiative signed by nearly 20 000 irvine residents to move forward with the veterans memorial park cemetery on the arda site at the great park however once elected khan banished the voter approved veterans cemetery from irvine altogether she even went out of her way to reject popular plans to start building a veterans memorial park something that should make every democrat cringe is the fact that khan appointed a notorious armenian genocide denier to her mayor s advisory council and she was caught on video telling members of the turkish community that she stood with them no matter what and then went on to participate in a joke about making armenians disappear when the video became public a few weeks ago khan issued a defiant statement saying the video had been doctored by campaign rivals after multiple sources confirmed the authenticity of the video khan was forced to issue an apology during the april 12th city council meeting dozens from within the armenian community provided public comments many spoke passionately about losing relatives in the armenian genocide which took place during world war i when 1 5 million armenians were killed by the turkish government one speaker referenced his disgust with the democratic party s support of khan after the irvine democratic club had voted not to endorse the mayor democratic party bosses in anaheim rushed through an early endorsement of khan months before the official candidate filing period opens clearly these democratic party bosses sense that mayor khan is in serious political trouble here in irvine a city that prides itself on being one of the most diverse thoroughly integrated communities in america on april 14th the southern california armenian democrats released a statement on facebook saying that khan has still not met with armenian community leaders and calling on democratic elected officials to rescind their endorsement of the mayor i can t help but wonder if the democratic party and the democratic elected officials who have publicly endorsed mayor khan would continue to support her if she had been filmed joking with and appointing to her inner circle of advisors a holocaust denier or an individual who regularly bashes the lgbtq community several political consultants speaking on condition of anonymity have referred to khan as increasingly toxic according to one longtime democratic party consultant active in many los angeles and orange county campaigns khan has become radioactive orange county democrats who hold state or federal office are going to be rethinking their endorsements of khan for fear that their association with her will hurt every democratic candidate on the ballot in november,Irvine Community News & Views,facebook

138,martinez property tax measure would save scenic ridgeline by shomik mukherjee bay area news group just a mile from the historic home of revered naturalist john muir lies the kind of scenic wilderness he spent his life fighting to conserve 297 acres of a grassy oak covered ridgeline landscape known as the alhambra hills for more than a decade richfield real estate corp has held onto city permits that allow it to build 109 single family homes on 70 acres of the property on the southern edge of town but instead of building the texas based property manager held off for myriad reasons over the years and agreed in march to sell the land to the city for 19 25 million so it can be preserved permanently to raise that kind of money the city has placed a property tax measure on the june 7 ballot if measure f is passed by a two thirds vote owners of single family parcels would pay 79 a year and those of nonresidential properties from 150 to 600 over the next three decades while the tax is estimated to generate 20 million during that period city officials hope environmental groups could chip in the difference if the actual amount falls short of the sales price for alhambra hills if the measure fails richfield says it intends to proceed with development to those who support the measure the decision to conserve alhambra hills for generations to come is a slam dunk it s really a magical view up there a stunning ridge said councilman mark ross who often visited the area as a child the way the forest parts into the open california grassland that s really special ross said if residents approve the tax measure the city would turn the ridgeline property into the greatest central park a city could have on the west coast the land also holds historical significance because some of it apparently once belonged to muir according to martinez resident jamie fox who leads the save alhambra hills open space committee fox a google electrical engineer said he tracked down a u s national park service map in 2014 that revealed muir owned property on the ridgeline in the 1800s with help from muir s great grandson he brought the map to city officials who hadn t known about the history when they oversaw richfield s 300 page environmental impact report years earlier this is not just a city issue fox said this is a national historic site and we can t let it be destroyed it s too special stephen nussbaum richfield s director of asset management said the company in good faith gave the city the time it needs to buy the property if measure f fails we intend to proceed with the approved project nussbaum said in an email explaining that richfield has already invested millions of dollars since buying the property richfield has been trying to get the project off the ground since the early 1990s when it initially won the city s approval for a much larger development of 212 homes on 122 acres back then environmental groups got involved and pointed out the ridgeline serves as a habitat for the threatened alameda whipsnake in the face of opposition richfield backed off and agreed to downsize the project s scale richfield subsequently discovered that building homes on the steep hillside would be much more expensive than anticipated and a once stable housing market that turned volatile in the late 2000s didn t help by the time richfield came back in 2011 seeking approval for the downsized development and promising to create a public trail network on the rest of the property city officials didn t want to see any homes built along the ridgeline but city officials felt their hands were tied because the area has been zoned residential since the 1970s and richfield had already agreed to cut the number of homes by more than half to mitigate potential environmental impacts such as harming the whipsnake so the council with ross dissenting approved permits for the 109 home development several council members made it clear they did so to avoid a potential lawsuit asked why the council had turned sour on the development after once being for it ross said the original approval came well before the value of pure open space was realized by communities and legislative bodies soon it was hey this development is really ugly i m in real estate it s my industry and i can tell you this is a significant visual detriment to many parts of martinez no organized opposition to measure f has surfaced yet ross said the public has come to understand the value of the environment he surmised that s been a gradual learning curve he added open space is the most obvious because unlike global warming you can see the subdivision on this hill forever it s a glaring environmental issue,Pete 4Joseph Sabine,facebook
