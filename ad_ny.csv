invited to attend a special luncheon on may 3rd to commemorate this milestone bill guglielmo rachel siderine the organization began with seven members and today consists of 23 chambers of commerce and affiliate partners as an umbrella organization the alliance s purpose is to address concerns of the regional business community this united association among chambers and partners provides a structure to address topics such as tourism economic development health care business community promotion education and workforce development in 2020 members of the alliance realized that an organization of this size needed considerably more administrative guidance and support than in previous years particularly if it would be continuing to offer virtual programming during the pandemic the genesis group was recommended to take on the administrative duties and the alliance in turn would became a committee within the framework of genesis the motion was unanimously approved effective january 2021 having the alliance functioning under the auspices of genesis is providing more stability and a stronger organizational foundation as evidenced by the 25 virtual meetings and forums held over a 22 month period during the pandemic on topics as economic development healthcare tourism and education while maintaining an ongoing dialogue with local county state and national business groups and elected officials in order to stay updated and informed on issues of importance to employers the collaboration is benefiting the region s business community particularly during times of economic uncertainty

potential downfall of george p bush the piece goes into quite a bit of detail about the impact that all of us have had in the fight to save the alamo you can press this link to see the original we have also posted the full article below alamo disrespecting george p bush may kill family s political dynasty by isabel vincent march 4 2022 7 40am new york post at first glance george prescott bush seems the ideal political candidate in a state where his family has been a powerful dynasty for decades the telegenic texas lawyer is a grandson of 41st us president george h w bush and the nephew of george w bush the 43rd he is the eldest son of two term florida gov jeb bush and the great grandson of us sen prescott bush of connecticut the war veteran and father of two married to blond lawyer amanda williams bush is also mexican american on his mother s side and speaks fluent spanish but that might not be enough according to critics who accuse him of being the black sheep of the family and disrespecting the alamo texas most treasured symbol by bringing in modern minded out of staters for its restoration on tuesday bush 45 and incumbent ken paxton beat two other republican candidates vying to be the party s pick in the attorney general s race now a critical may runoff will determine whether the fourth generation scion will be able to shore up the family s political legacy in the lone star state analysts say but that s another problem the bush name is not popular in texas anymore luke twombly a dallas based political consultant and former communications director of the texas republican party told the post paxton the texas attorney general since 2015 has been indicted on securities fraud charges and accused of bribery and misuse of office in a civil whistleblower lawsuit but still has the support of the state s conservatives he also has the endorsement of former president donald trump a situation bush hopes to reverse by invoking trump in his campaign ads which don t mention the titans in his own family under the leadership of president trump our country was strong and vibrant again says bush in a campaign video at another point in the ad he notes like president trump i will not sit idly by while our freedoms are under attack because texas must lead the way in fighting this radical agenda if bush is trying to capitalize on his devotion to trump his opponents hope to end the bush family s political dominance in texas which began after george h w moved with his wife barbara from connecticut to the lone star state in 1948 to work in the oil business if conservatives unite we can end the bush dynasty paxton told a lubbock radio station wednesday the bushes have had their chances it s time for the dynasty to end bush commissioner of the general land office in texas has faced withering criticism from both democrats and fellow republicans for his work restoring the alamo historic site he s also been under scrutiny for his agency s administration of veterans homes where the covid fatality rate was 25 percent at seven out of nine facilities more than double the rate at the state s other nursing homes during the height of the pandemic in his eagerness to seek endorsements from trump bush has broken with members of his own family becoming the black sheep of a clan that has little patience for trump s hold on the republican party i can t imagine that george p is getting a lot of love from his family in pursuit of the trump endorsement said twombly although he likely needs trump s endorsement to win the race others say bush lacks the same leadership genes that propelled his relatives to political victory well maybe he s not exactly a black sheep but bush is not the guy jerry patterson bush s predecessor on the general land office told the post i knew 41 and 43 and bush is not a guy who is a leader he s a decent enough fellow but if you want someone to make hard decisions he s out of it he avoids controversy puts his head down as commissioner of the glo he has played fast and loose with the alamo the state s most sacred historic site he added patterson was so incensed with what he called bush s lack of transparency and bungling of the monument s restoration that he decided to run against him to get his old job back in 2018 when patterson lost to bush in the republican primary for the commissioner s job he decided to back bush s democratic opponent miguel suazo in the commissioner s race he wasn t the only one never in my memory have all primary opponents of a republican candidate either endorsed the primary winner s democratic opponent or stated publicly they wouldn t vote for the republican primary winner patterson said in addition to patterson losing republican primary opponents in the race rick range davey edward and david watts all refused to back bush there are things that are more important than your party said patterson who ran the glo between 2003 and 2015 the alamo is texas among the criticisms of bush s work on the restoration of the site which will include a new museum with a rooftop garden is a lack of transparency and the hiring of a philadelphia design firm that suggested incorporating modern glass walls calling in all these out of state so called experts who knew nothing about the alamo nothing about what it means to texas was bush s first mistake according to range a retired firefighter in an interview with the texas monthly he cannot be trusted with the future of the alamo range told the magazine he s flip flopped more times than a catfish stranded on the bank of a river despite the criticisms bush prominently features images of the alamo in his campaign ads which also include several references to trump s domestic policy greatest hits in his latest ad bush reminds viewers that he is a former navy officer deployed to afghanistan and promises to finish trump s wall he is filmed in dark glasses riding an all terrain vehicle in the shadow of the wall that marks the southern border with mexico it s such bulls t said patterson every damned politician talks about the wall but the attorney general has no impact on shutting down the border it s all bulls t it s almost what you have to do if you are a republican in texas still patterson like others is hesitant to write off bush just yet do i think he has a chance he said i think he has a chance bush s

129,,,,a gay couple is suing their former landlord in manhattan after they said they were banned from passing out candy on halloween in 2018 faced ongoing anti lgbtq harassment including when building management allegedly removed the couple s rainbow flag from their apartment anthony dolci his husband ming infante who previously lived at dorchester towers at 155 west 68th street in manhattan claim in their suit that they faced a barrage of adversity from the building during their time living there the 2 5 million lawsuit filed in new york s supreme court on august 20 accuses the building s former property manager mrs kelly ann whipple desrosier and vice president of ogden cap properties john mcdermott of defamation malicious prosecution discrimination and filing false police reports dolci a latinx man and his husband infante an asian man believe they were targeted because of their race and sexual orientation now they are calling for the building to be held accountable for the alleged actions halloween night is just a very small glimpse of the injustices that this building did to my family dolci said they allowed dorchester towers employees to call the police with impunity over and over simply because they didn t like us and they wanted us out of the building dorchester towers allegedly hired off duty nypd officers as security guards to stand in the lobby of the building due to accusations that the couple made tenants feel unsafe the complaint states on halloween night the security officers went even further and barred the couple from participating in trick or treating activities in the building in protest of the guard s orders dolci who was wearing a witch s hat no t shirt and a yellow cape headed outside with a bag of treats according to footage reviewed by gay city news dolci was holding a glow in the dark halloween globe and pleaded for help while the guards attempted to snatch his bag of candy from off of the street in the video the guards allegedly confirmed that they were calling the cops on dolci because he cannot block the pedestrians for what for standing on a public street infante chimed in from their bedroom window for standing on a public street the 22 page complaint claims the police were called at least 25 times on the couple with at least half of those times resulting in dolci being arrested or taken to local hospitals for psychiatric evaluations he added they were weaponizing the 911 call center against us dolci said the following year whipple allegedly told the couple they did not fit in with the building and did not dress appropriately for the building dolci claims the couple was repeatedly reprimanded for trivial reasons such as when whipple allegedly criticized the couple for listening to lgbtq singer boy george and madonna because it was not appropriate for the building i felt she s talking about my sexuality i wear nail polish i am flamboyant dolci said i think i didn t fit her idea of what a gay person should be for this building he added i m not gonna tiptoe around anyone with my sexuality and i think that when i stood up to her about that she retaliated the couple is also accusing the staff of removing the rainbow flag that was placed on their door general counsel for ogden cap properties stephen nahley denied the allegations the accusations contained in the lawsuit concerning dorchester towers ms whipple and our other employees are baseless totally without merit we will defend them vigorously and are confident that we will prevail nahley said in a written statement to gay city news whipple and mcdermott did not immediately reply to gay city news request for comment in march of 2019 the couple moved out of the apartment and soon after dolci began standing outside the high end condos in protest during a couple of dolci s one person rallies the building s staff allegedly began spraying and assaulting him with water hoses and damaging his signs dolci said he submitted this footage along with a complaint to the new york city human rights commission in a statement the commission said they cannot comment on the status of open investigations but once the matter is closed it is then publicly available information in april out gay ny state senator brad hoylman spoke out in support of the couple at the stop false police reporting rally at one police plaza in a statement to gay city news hoylman called the allegations of false police reports troubling and said he hopes we can get to the bottom of it last year as an outgrowth of the alleged harassment dolci started gays against dorchester towers a facebook page chronicling the couple s movement to hold the building responsible for their alleged actions we could have been the worst tenants in the building which we weren t dolci said but that doesn t justify breaking the law and abusing people and abusing their position of power and using the police as a weapon story and interview by tat bellamy

265,,,,in case you ve missed this habeas corpus case to be heard by the supreme court on march 28th 2022 the new york state court of appeals issued a notice that they are scheduled to hear the habeas corpus appeal involving happy the elephant at the bronx zoo filed by an animal liberation group nonhuman rights project nhrp has been ongoing since 2018 better than 3 38 million dollars has been spent on legal fees to defend against this action which will impact animal owners across america to date 1 3 million has been spent on amicus curiae briefs by all parties protect the harvest is an organization which stands up for the interest of animal owners and we have joined this fight while we are not a party to the matter we have participated in these briefs as a friend of the court and have joined with other parties to submit briefs in action from day one according to the website businessjustice com the amicus curia brief can play an important and sometimes critical role in appellate advocacy by bringing relevant facts and arguments to the court s attention that the parties have not already addressed to fully comprehend the significance of these legal actions along with the impact on all animals and animal ownership as well as human civil rights it is necessary to look at what habeas corpus means habeas corpus is for humans not animals the ability for an animal to have habeas corpus would imply that they are persons and can participate in a social contract however animals are unable to be held legally liable for their actions even if an animal such as a chimpanzee has some human like traits that does not make the animal a person habeas corpus for animals brings rise to a number of questions if an animal were to be awarded habeas corpus where would the line be drawn for future cases what is to stop animal rights extremists from litigating further habeas corpus is a common law civil right it was written for and by people taking the law out of context to make it fit into the animal world reduces the significance of our human civil rights habeas corpus was written into our constitution by our forefathers to protect human beings animals were and still are considered a person s property and thus do not need protection from imprisonment to go against this foundational principle is to go against the very makeup of our great country what is habeas corpus habeas corpus has roots that extend back to the 12th century in england and is most commonly referred from the magna carta the magna carta states the following no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or be disseized of his freehold or liberties or free customs or be outlawed or exiled or any other wise destroyed nor will we not pass upon him nor condemn him but by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land the united states added habeas corpus to our own constitution during its establishment under the suspension clause article one section 9 it is written as the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it the main purpose of habeas corpus is to inquire about the validity of a prisoner s custody it is often used to determine if the court had jurisdiction to impose a sentence as this is a civil right the sole purpose is to protect the freedom of humans from infringement essentially in modern usage habeas corpus refers to the right of a detained individual to be brought before a court or judge to determine whether the imprisonment is legal and justified animal rights and habeas corpus the average person would understand that habeas corpus refers to human beings only and not animals but animal rights extremists do not feel that way animal rights are not the same as animal welfare the ideology of animal rights is that animal ownership is akin to slavery and therefore abuse to that end animal rights extremist groups work to end all human animal interaction nonhuman rights project and habeas corpus for animals in 2007 a group called the nonhuman rights project nhrp formed their main goal is to change the status of animals to have the same rights as humans the mission statement on their website states to change the common law status of great apes elephants dolphins and whales from mere things which lack the capacity to possess any legal right to legal persons who possess such fundamental rights as bodily liberty and bodily integrity to get this accomplished the nhrp works both locally and globally in grassroots and legislative campaigns the founder of this group steven wise has an extensive background in animal rights in the past he worked as the former president of the animal legal defense fund and has written multiple books on the animal rights movement has also taught animal rights law at harvard law school vermont law school and tufts university school of veterinary medicine among others the nhrp website states that they have sought habeas corpus for 8 animals seven of these cases have been dismissed or overturned wildlife conservation society operates the bronx zoo where happy lives a february 2022 article in the new yorker outlines information about the bronx zoo and the wildlife conservation society it also provided a quote from bronx zoo director james breheny few organizations have done as much for protecting animals in nature as the wildlife conservation society which in addition to the bronx zoo operates the central park zoo the prospect park zoo the queens zoo and the new york aquarium the society focuses on the conservation of six flagship groups apes big cats sharks skates and rays whales and coastal dolphins tortoises and freshwater turtles and elephants one of the society s first projects in 1905 helped save the american bison from extinction a campaign called 96 elephants named for the number of elephants thought to be killed every day by poachers was launched in 2013 james breheny the director of the bronx zoo stated that the society had led the charge to help stop the ruthless slaughter of 35 000 african elephants each year for the ivory trade as for happy breheny declared with evident frustration we are forced to defend ourselves against a group that doesn t know us or the animal in question who has absolutely no legal standing and is demanding to take control over the life and future of an elephant that we have known and cared for over 40 years he went on they continue to waste court resources to promote their radical philosophical view of personhood veterinary groups weigh in in september of 2021 several veterinary groups weighed in with their own amici curiae brief in support of the wildlife conservation society and the bronx zoo these groups included the american veterinary medical association avma new york state veterinary medical society and the american association of veterinary medical colleges the avma represents about 75 of veterinarians in the united states and holds 97 000 members the aavmc represents more than 40 000 faculty staff and students and the nysvms represents more than 2 000 licensed veterinarians in new york state the brief consists of 46 pages and can be reviewed by opening the link at the bottom of this article the brief contains many valuable statements this is the opening the veterinary community is filing this brief because it is gravely concerned that redefining the human animal legal system in this way will negatively impact animals welfare history has shown that animal ownership is not only permissive it is protective congress and state legislatures as well as courts have long enacted 5 important safeguards and regulations that promote responsible animal ownership deter abuse and advanced animal care changing these rights and responsibilities as proposed here would create instant enormous and pervasive confusion it could limit or even eliminate the ability of animal owners to choose the proper course of treatment for their animals by subjecting their decisions to outside intervention by third parties if animals do not receive the timely care they need including during legal battles over their fate they are the ones who will suffer ownership is the true pro animal position animal owners including zoos should remain responsible and accountable for properly caring for and treating their animals because this lawsuit promotes animal personhood rights above animals welfare it should be rejected this decision will impact animal owners veterinary medicine and agriculture across the county the upcoming may 18th trial in the court of appeals in new york the equivalent of the state supreme court has the potential to cause a devastating impact on animals and animal welfare across the country a decision to award habeas corpus would be a grave step towards pushing society to no longer see an animal as an animal and respect its unique differences from that of human beings if an animal is awarded civil rights the end result is that they will no longer be property this will mean that someone else can make decisions about what is best for our own animals we will no longer be able to make decisions in their best interest it would ultimately cause the closing of every educational zoo and every laboratory conducting lifesaving research that benefits both animals and humans it would certainly impact our precious food system and even owning a pet will become a thing of the past it will impact the cost of veterinary care and veterinary professional liability insurance and it can also impact the way in which veterinarians practice medicine where will the line be drawn in the united states what will happen to the animals we share our daily lives

298,,,,lately disney has been at the forefront of the discussion about diversity and discrimination especially against the lgbtq community our population is made up of a very diverse group of people of all races sexes nationalities and sexual orientations this is nothing new discrimination has also been around forever in the 1960 s it was against the law for blacks and whites to get married in some states before the 1920 s women were treated as second class citizens and did not even have the right to vote in many places people of varying sexual orientations have always been part of our population but for far too long they have been discriminated against even imprisoned for what they are today most people recognize that people of all races and sexual orientations all have the same rights discrimination is perpetuated when movies and literature do not represent the society they are portraying one of the very first movies was birth of a nation which inaccurately portrayed races and glorified racial stereotypes and discrimination of course movies have come a very long way since then but even today most movies and television shows do not represent all aspects of our society and even fewer focus on the minorities among us people today do not socialize with their neighbors and fellow citizens nearly as closely as we did in the past people tend to learn about others as much if not more from movies and television shows as they do from real life interactions if i walk down the streets of new york city or chicago or los angeles i am going to see people of all races religions nationalities and sexual orientations they are part of that environment and are accepted as such by the rest of new yorkers they see them every day they work with them they are neighbors to each other they are not afraid of them on the other hand if i live outside new york city and am watching a show based in present day new york city my view of that city is influenced by how the people are portrayed and in turn my view of the minority peoples that i may not personally interact with on a regular basis that s why especially in rural areas the attitudes towards minorities are much different because people there do not regularly see and interact with nearly as many people of different races nationalities and sexual orientations they are not comfortable around them and discrimination flourishes i live in a semi rural part of virginia we do not see a lot of foreigners we do not see a lot of people of the jewish or muslim faiths our county is 90 white people with sexual orientations outside the mainstream are still ostracized here because people here are not exposed to these other elements of society they are much more likely to believe the false narratives that all immigrants are rapists and drug dealers or that all lgbtq people are perverts who want to attack your children or that most blacks are criminals or that all muslims want to impose sharia law on the rest of us or other even more ridiculous narratives this is why it is so important that movies and television shows accurately reflect our society especially for the viewers outside the larger metropolitan areas as more and more shows include minorities of all types as they exist in the real world we will see people s prejudices and fear gradually subside we have seen this work before women were accepted into the workplace during world war ii because they were needed as the men were at war after the war the attitudes towards women working began to change although not accepted nearly as much as women working interracial relationships are no longer the kiss of death and are even beginning to be accepted as normal by many attitudes towards lgbtq members are just beginning to change and eventually they will also be accepted as normal disney should be commended to taking a stand to fight discrimination of all types as that leaked video showed they are very concerned with making sure that their movies shows and theme parks accurately represent our society one clip from that video included the statement that their goal was to have at least 50 of their characters be minorities this does not mean that 50 of the characters in each show will be black this does not mean that 50 of the characters in every show will be gay this does not mean that 50 of the characters in each show will be asian this does not mean that 50 of the characters in each show will be muslim this does not mean that 50 of the characters in each show will be hispanic this does not mean that 50 of the characters in each show will be women it means that their goal is that 50 of the characters in each show will be at least one type of a minority which is true in our society unfortunately some people with agendas of their own have attempted to cast these actions in a negative light they have accused disney of being pedophiles and grooming children which is absolutely ridiculous and disgusting i don t know why these people are spreading these lies maybe they are just scared of change or of what they don t know maybe they are political opportunists who see an opportunity to further divide our country and spread hate just to solidify their base and win the next election stop listening to their lies and prejudices people with prejudices against the lgbtq community are the ones spreading the lies that kindergartners are being taught about sex and even managed to get a law passed outlawing that in florida what a crock sex education has been a part of our public school curriculum since they 1960 s it has never been taught to kids under the 4th grade each sexual education course is tailored to the age level of the students to which it is taught for example kids in 4th grade are taught about puberty and the changes their bodies will be going through this is age appropriate as some girls and boys began to enter puberty at that time they are not taught about the more advanced topics of birth control safe sex etc until they are older there are national sex education standards that are followed by many school districts the truth is these bigots don t want their children learning that being lgbtq is not a disease or a crime or some sort of perversion they want their children to learn their prejudices and continue society s discrimination against the lgbtq community this is harming society as a whole by perpetuating prejudice and discrimination even worse for kids who are generally confused about their own sexual orientations these prejudices cause unnecessary shame and emotional stress and it s no wonder that these kids develop very high rates of depression and suicide that can haunt them for the rest of their lives,"prejudice,curriculum,school,blacks,gay,muslims,racial,sex,right to vote,environment,white people,sharia,suicide,black,sharia law,education
