of january uh in the year 2022 in this month alone here in new york city five police officers have been shot two of them died jason rivera and brother maura these are very young police officers dedicated to the force and it was a tragedy that ripped through the heart of of god fearing uh people all over everywhere that these officers lost their lives guns on the street of new york streets of new york and south side of chicago and other ghettos and also in the suburbs like you will not believe but gun violence is up now higher than it s been in quite some time new york city has just taken on a new mayor a hammer brother by the name of eric adams who uh was a former police officer himself but i want to and he s decided the way to deal with this this heart wrenching tragedy of these two very young police officers lives being cut down by a glock automatic gun with 47 rounds in it is to put plainclothes policemen back on the street they were part of that group that was once the stop and frisk group uh and the ones that claimed uh who had a a cult called we owned the night that was a part of the shooting of amadou the allo up in the bronx where they shot him 41 times and they saw a cell phone in this hand and said it was a gun they didn t shoot him once all of them opened fire 41 times on amado diallo and eric adams is saying you want to put those men back out on the street to combat gun violence i want to suggest to you that you helped me get this word out that we need to start what is known uh as the joseph project to save our young men and police officers and you need to try to get this word to eric adams or to some of the people that have bankrolled uh his mirror being elected mayor and to others as well that the police are not going to be able to do this job to stop the young men and to get the guns off the street they have that gun buyback programs and things are worse now than they ve ever been but here s what almighty god has said to me to suggest to mayor eric adams that he will start what is known as a joseph project and by that i mean we need to get men who have been in prison been convicted of crimes and have spent at least seven years in prison of a crime they were convicted of and who have been rehabilitated not by the system not by the bars not by the constraints but they have been rehabilitated along the lines the way red of shawshank redemption was rehabilitated where after being there for years and years his whole mindset changed his whole understanding of the dynamics of the world he understood what he was doing when he did it he didn t know what he was doing he was just a young man he had no idea but now he s come to a reckoning point and he understands clearly that is wrong you got men like that right now in dana mora you got men and attica you ve got men in auburn green haven comstock you got men like that in railway state prison but for new york let s stay within the new york confines that have been in prison for seven years or more and they have been not not corrected as a state of correction or rehabilitated according to what some psychiatrist says about criminals but they have been reformed they have been reborn they have studied they have become articulate they have used their time there to read they understand the science of pythagoras they ve they ve read philosophy they ve read the bible they ve even read the quran they ve read most religions many of them have read the hindu and buddhist versions of the bagadad gita they ve read world history they ve read about great men they ve read about criminals they ve read about iceberg slim they ve read to kill a mockingbird they re well read because over the years they have self educated themselves they ve read richard wright s black boy they they they are well read they re well spoken but yet they got another 25 years on their prison centers they re no longer criminals they are what they potentially could have been have they been raised in a strong environment with a strong pastor and a strong moral understanding these young men and they made mistakes they just couldn t analyze and computate and understand the wrong that they were doing or the harm that they did when they were criminals i m saying to merrick out mayor eric adams we need to put together a program called the joseph project let me interview these men along with some staff of other people not psychiatrists not sociologists to hell with them and not parole boy people let me talk with these men and let s bring them out of prison and put them on the streets give them a job on the streets by the schools up and down the avenues of harlem of fort greene of south bronx of south jamaica of bed stein and the ghettos and if the program works well here in new york then it can go nationally to south side chicago to los angeles to uh those ghettos as well south central los angeles but we can start here in new york and let me tell you why the joseph project works first of all i m taking talking about or referencing joseph the son of israel the youngest boy of israel who was thrown into prison by a woman who set him up set the boy up and then grabbed his jacket and lied on him he was a good man but he got put in prison and stayed there many many years but word got out to pharaoh when trouble was hitting egypt the way trouble is hitting america now the way trouble is hitting new york you ain t seen nothing the summer s going to come and the guns are going to be out there and the shootings are going to take place here in harlem is nearly a shooting every day people pushing people in front of the subways crime everywhere people jumping out of cars and broad daylight shooting people robbing burger kings at this year 2022 people sticking up joints you still got stick up kids going on and it s only going to get worse the people who know best how to deal with this or people who used to do it themselves but now they re mature they re well educated many of them are in their 50s now and i m saying get this word to eric adams here i have a problem i m not a democrat i m not a republican i m not an african american i don t i don t go down those roads i m not a liberal i m not an independent and so because i m not on either one of those sides americas politically are very competitive if you re not democrat then we ain t gonna help you if you re not republican we re not gonna help you and i m neither one so i but if you re republican we ll have to fight the democrats if you re a democrat we have to fight the republicans but i m neither one i i need to count on that small slither of people that hear me and know i m saying the truth and don t just walk away and not help me we need to get these men out of prison get them i don t know if you will or suspend this sentence and if they ve been there for longer in seven years they ve been timed to be rehabilitated and i can talk with them i you know i ve been there too i ve been to prison and and and look at the man i ve turned out to be um a community builder founder of three schools builder of a church and a ministry and and and and the things i ve done over the years uh it s just been phenomenal without other men they re probably better than i we need to get them out of there by the grace of god i was able to get out now we need to give them a salary now you re not going to take them out and put them on the streets i m suggesting and i would not settle for anything less these men that have spent at least seven years in prison and if they qualify and window does that anybody just because they ve been in seven years he got to have his head screwed all right he you can tell whether he s been reformed or not um but they ve been there give them a salary starting at a hundred thousand dollars a year to be on the street every day be on the street to two from from seven o clock in the morning to two o clock in the morning you know and and ships walk in the streets you see these young boys you see numbers on fox avenue up on whole avenue you know up on tremont up in the bronx or you you see them on 125th street 116th street edgecomb avenue you see them in the parks these men and and the fact that this will get publicity it ll be all over the television all of the newspapers that these men are out there and these young boys can come talk to them and and they can be in in such a way as the young boys will know you know i m an ex con myself don t go down the road i went down let me talk to you brother let me show you how to get your stuff together let me show you there s a better way and and and begin they ll take the guns off the street i guarantee you that you ll see crime go down by as much as 70 percent in the first year by having putting the police on the street is not here you re saying eric adams put more police on the street that s not the answer mayor laurie lightfoot out in chicago putting more police on the streets not there and you know it s not the answer you re just saying that because you don t know what else to say eric adams putting more police on the street is not the answer it s going to clog up the courts it s gonna cause more cause more shootings and more disillusionment eric adams you know putting more police on the street is not the answer it has never been the answer we need to put men who understand the hood men who understand the thinking process of these young boys and other criminals and put them out there as examples the new york state prison has produced this as your mentor he s in he s been in dannemora for 12 years he s now your mentor he has a decent salary so i can get a decent place to live they ll have to worry about committing crimes a hundred thousand dollars a year you give him two thousand dollars a week salary he can now pr buy his food have a car find a wife raise a family he doesn t have to worry about crying at to steal sell drugs any of that that money will reinforce his commitment to truth and reality so you know i need you to help me get this word out people have ostracized me but i m the man god sent me to harlem that s right god his name is jesus sent me to harlem and i had the men here until obama came along and and obama is a mega problem i believe the reason why trayvon martin is dead and in his grave and his flesh has rotted the same thing with michael brown and a whole lot of others it s because they believe that obama was the answer the same way that eric adam believed that putting more police off on police officers on the street and all of these other mayors putting more police officers on the street is the answer these young men could not rationalize to understand that obama was not the answer he was not going to pay their bills he was not going to make them invincible when you get shot you re going to die nobody if obama s obama s presidency is not going to make you bulletproof trayvon martin not going to make you bulletproof michael brown and we got to understand that otherwise the death toll continues let me be heard let me be heard let me talk to these men in dannemora and attica let me talk to these men let me sit down with them and let the state give them a suspended centers let the courts write a law that says well if you commit any crimes then there ll be no need if you re paying a man a hundred thousand dollars a year you ain t gonna need no you ll need to commit no crimes you know because it s all about money music and trust me these men have the confidence and the strength and the respect and the education these men most of them that i and i met with them i talked with them i sat with them you know uh and they are well trained they are principled and they re what these other young men on the street who don t have the fathers in the homes these young 17 18 19 year old boys don t have a father in the home but their father could be the man that was once in dannemora who s now on the street in the park winter summer and fall constantly on the streets in south jamaica south bronx fort greene harlem or ben stein and we can change the dynamics not on that but we can inspire other men in prison to clean wipe your nose get your act together clean yourself up there s a better way for for the last 75 years we have been creating a prison complex warehousing flesh warehousing hundreds of thousands of men just warehousing them throwing them in prison lock and throwing away the key and warehousing flesh and it hasn t helped and any fool can see more police officers is not the answer we need more jesus is what we need we need more truth we need more righteous men hear me don t let this appeal fall on down on closed ears deaf ears hear me for the young boy that gets saved might be your very own and some of your sons might be there that can come home now he s been gone now for 15 years he s clean shaven he s got a shine on his face he understands the world you can send him as the ambassador to russia you can send him down to the united nations you can send them to africa he d been in prison for 15 years kept his nose clean never been in solitary well maybe some have been no my friends help me eric adams let s do this joseph project and this gonna make you a great man oh my goodness oh you could run to mayor for the rest of new york s in his tenure but if not relying on police and more police and more shootings more rest more handcuffs then you re already into a failure and a fail system i m james david manning everybody i m here at the outlaw world missionary church on 123rd street our telephone number is 800 877 777 0734 and you of course you can pick up the information from the back end of this video come talk to me come talk to me but most of all talk to eric adams and the people around him because the life you save might be your own the shootings at the joseph project will stop what might be a bullet that s aimed for you but because you work to get the joseph project launched you still have your life your 14 year old girl will not be shot down going through the park trying to get home from school one day with a book bag and a hand the joseph project is what it s
