The war veteran and father of two, married to blond lawyer Amanda Williams Bush, is also Mexican American on his mother’s side, and speaks fluent Spanish.\n\nBut that might not be enough, according to critics who accuse him of being the black sheep of the family and disrespecting the Alamo, Texas’ most treasured symbol, by bringing in modern-minded out-of-staters for its restoration.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bush, 45, and incumbent Ken Paxton beat two other Republican candidates vying to be the party’s pick in the attorney general’s race.\n\nNow, a critical May runoff will determine whether the fourth-generation scion will be able to shore up the family’s political legacy in the Lone Star State, analysts say. \n\nBut that’s another problem: “The Bush name is not popular in Texas anymore,” Luke Twombly, a Dallas-based political consultant and former communications director of the Texas Republican Party, told The Post.\n\nPaxton, the Texas attorney general since 2015, has been indicted on securities fraud charges and accused of bribery and misuse of office in a civil whistleblower lawsuit, but still has the support of the state’s conservatives. He also has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump — a situation Bush hopes to reverse by invoking Trump in his campaign ads, which don’t mention the titans in his own family.\n\n“Under the leadership of President Trump, our country was strong and vibrant again,” says Bush in a campaign video. At another point in the ad, he notes, “Like President Trump, I will not sit idly by while our freedoms are under attack, because Texas must lead the way in fighting this radical agenda.” \n\nIf Bush is trying to capitalize on his devotion to Trump, his opponents hope to end the Bush family’s political dominance in Texas, which began after George H.W. moved with his wife, Barbara, from Connecticut to the Lone Star State in 1948 to work in the oil business.\n\n“If conservatives unite … we can end the Bush dynasty,” Paxton told a Lubbock radio station Wednesday. “The Bushes have had their chances. It’s time for the dynasty to end.”\n\nBush, commissioner of the General Land Office in Texas, has faced withering criticism from both Democrats and fellow Republicans for his work restoring the Alamo historic site. He’s also been under scrutiny for his agency’s administration of veterans’ homes, where the COVID fatality rate was 25 percent at seven out of nine facilities — more than double the rate at the state’s other nursing homes during the height of the pandemic.\n\nIn his eagerness to seek endorsements from Trump, Bush has broken with members of his own family, becoming the black sheep of a clan that has little patience for Trump’s hold on the Republican Party. \n\n“I can’t imagine that George P. is getting a lot of love from his family in pursuit of the Trump endorsement,” said Twombly.\n\nAlthough he likely needs Trump’s endorsement to win the race, others say Bush lacks the same leadership genes that propelled his relatives to political victory.\n\n“Well, maybe he’s not exactly a black sheep, but Bush is not the guy,” Jerry Patterson, Bush’s predecessor on the General Land Office, told The Post. “I knew 41 and 43, and Bush is not a guy who is a leader. He’s a decent enough fellow, but if you want someone to make hard decisions, he’s out of it. He avoids controversy, puts his head down.”\n\nAs commissioner of the GLO, he has played fast and loose with the Alamo, the state’s most sacred historic site, he added. Patterson was so incensed with what he called Bush’s lack of transparency and bungling of the monument’s restoration that he decided to run against him to get his old job back in 2018.\n\nWhen Patterson lost to Bush in the Republican primary for the commissioner’s job, he decided to back Bush’s Democratic opponent, Miguel Suazo, in the commissioner’s race. He wasn’t the only one.\n\n“Never in my memory have all primary opponents of a Republican candidate either endorsed the primary winner’s Democratic opponent or stated publicly they wouldn’t vote for the Republican primary winner,” Patterson said.\n\nIn addition to Patterson, losing Republican primary opponents in the race — Rick Range, Davey Edward and David Watts — all refused to back Bush.\n\n“There are things that are more important than your party,” said Patterson, who ran the GLO between 2003 and 2015. “The Alamo is Texas.”\n\nAmong the criticisms of Bush’s work on the restoration of the site, which will include a new museum with a rooftop garden, is a lack of transparency and the hiring of a Philadelphia design firm that suggested incorporating modern glass walls.\n\n“Calling in all these out-of-state so-called experts who knew nothing about the Alamo, nothing about what it means to Texas” was Bush’s first mistake, according to Range, a retired firefighter, in an interview with the Texas Monthly. \n\n“He cannot be trusted with the future of the Alamo,” Range told the magazine. “He’s flip-flopped more times than a catfish stranded on the bank of a river.”\n\nDespite the criticisms, Bush prominently features images of the Alamo in his campaign ads, which also include several references to Trump’s domestic policy greatest hits. \n\nIn his latest ad, Bush reminds viewers that he is a former Navy officer deployed to Afghanistan, and promises to finish “Trump’s wall.” He is filmed in dark glasses riding an all-terrain vehicle in the shadow of the wall that marks the southern border with Mexico. \n\n“It’s such bulls–t,” said Patterson. “Every damned politician talks about the wall, but the attorney general has no impact on shutting down the border. It’s all bulls–t. It’s almost what you have to do if you are a Republican in Texas.”\n\nStill, Patterson, like others, is hesitant to write off Bush just yet.\n\n“Do I think he has a chance?” he said. “I think he has a chance.”\n\nBush’s campaign and spokesman did not return The Post’s calls and emails Thursday.']",,Save The Alamo Committee,,,"[{'percentage': '0.00125', 'age': '18-24', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.18019', 'age': '65+', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.000833', 'age': '35-44', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.003958', 'age': '65+', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.029059', 'age': '45-54', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.00677', 'age': '35-44', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.013644', 'age': '25-34', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.002187', 'age': '25-34', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.247266', 'age': '55-64', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.002396', 'age': '55-64', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.046662', 'age': '35-44', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.106656', 'age': '55-64', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.233309', 'age': '65+', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.122591', 'age': '45-54', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.001354', 'age': '45-54', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.001562', 'age': '18-24', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.000312', 'age': '25-34', 'gender': 'unknown'}]",Save the Alamo,187713745097888,315371274056404,1000001,,10000,14999,0,99

BUSH MAY KILL FAMILY’S POLITICAL DYNASTY\n\nPlease see the excellent article by Isabel Vincent that just came out in the NEW YORK POST on March 4 describing the potential downfall of George P. Bush.

Bush may kill family’s political dynasty\nBy Isabel Vincent\nMarch 4, 2022 7:40am\nNEW YORK POST \n \nAt first glance, George Prescott Bush seems the ideal political candidate in a state where his family has been a powerful dynasty for decades.\n\nThe telegenic Texas lawyer is a grandson of 41st US President George H.W. Bush and the nephew of George W. Bush, the 43rd. He is the eldest son of two-term Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the great-grandson of US Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut. The war veteran and father of two, married to blond lawyer Amanda Williams Bush, is also Mexican American on his mother’s side, and speaks fluent Spanish.\n\nBut that might not be enough, according to critics who accuse him of being the black sheep of the family and disrespecting the Alamo, Texas’ most treasured symbol, by bringing in modern-minded out-of-staters for its restoration.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bush, 45, and incumbent Ken Paxton beat two other Republican candidates vying to be the party’s pick in the attorney general’s race.\n\nNow, a critical May runoff will determine whether the fourth-generation scion will be able to shore up the family’s political legacy in the Lone Star State, analysts say. \n\nBut that’s another problem: “The Bush name is not popular in Texas anymore,” Luke Twombly, a Dallas-based political consultant and former communications director of the Texas Republican Party, told The Post.\n\nPaxton, the Texas attorney general since 2015, has been indicted on securities fraud charges and accused of bribery and misuse of office in a civil whistleblower lawsuit, but still has the support of the state’s conservatives. He also has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump — a situation Bush hopes to reverse by invoking Trump in his campaign ads, which don’t mention the titans in his own family.\n\n“Under the leadership of President Trump, our country was strong and vibrant again,” says Bush in a campaign video. At another point in the ad, he notes, “Like President Trump, I will not sit idly by while our freedoms are under attack, because Texas must lead the way in fighting this radical agenda.” \n\nIf Bush is trying to capitalize on his devotion to Trump, his opponents hope to end the Bush family’s political dominance in Texas, which began after George H.W. moved with his wife, Barbara, from Connecticut to the Lone Star State in 1948 to work in the oil business.\n\n“If conservatives unite … we can end the Bush dynasty,” Paxton told a Lubbock radio station Wednesday. “The Bushes have had their chances. It’s time for the dynasty to end.”\n\nBush, commissioner of the General Land Office in Texas, has faced withering criticism from both Democrats and fellow Republicans for his work restoring the Alamo historic site. He’s also been under scrutiny for his agency’s administration of veterans’ homes, where the COVID fatality rate was 25 percent at seven out of nine facilities — more than double the rate at the state’s other nursing homes during the height of the pandemic.\n\nIn his eagerness to seek endorsements from Trump, Bush has broken with members of his own family, becoming the black sheep of a clan that has little patience for Trump’s hold on the Republican Party. \n\n“I can’t imagine that George P. is getting a lot of love from his family in pursuit of the Trump endorsement,” said Twombly.\n\nAlthough he likely needs Trump’s endorsement to win the race, others say Bush lacks the same leadership genes that propelled his relatives to political victory.\n\n“Well, maybe he’s not exactly a black sheep, but Bush is not the guy,” Jerry Patterson, Bush’s predecessor on the General Land Office, told The Post. “I knew 41 and 43, and Bush is not a guy who is a leader. He’s a decent enough fellow, but if you want someone to make hard decisions, he’s out of it. He avoids controversy, puts his head down.”\n\nAs commissioner of the GLO, he has played fast and loose with the Alamo, the state’s most sacred historic site, he added. Patterson was so incensed with what he called Bush’s lack of transparency and bungling of the monument’s restoration that he decided to run against him to get his old job back in 2018.\n\nWhen Patterson lost to Bush in the Republican primary for the commissioner’s job, he decided to back Bush’s Democratic opponent, Miguel Suazo, in the commissioner’s race. He wasn’t the only one.\n\n“Never in my memory have all primary opponents of a Republican candidate either endorsed the primary winner’s Democratic opponent or stated publicly they wouldn’t vote for the Republican primary winner,” Patterson said.\n\nIn addition to Patterson, losing Republican primary opponents in the race — Rick Range, Davey Edward and David Watts — all refused to back Bush.\n\n“There are things that are more important than your party,” said Patterson, who ran the GLO between 2003 and 2015. “The Alamo is Texas.”\n\nAmong the criticisms of Bush’s work on the restoration of the site, which will include a new museum with a rooftop garden, is a lack of transparency and the hiring of a Philadelphia design firm that suggested incorporating modern glass walls.\n\n“Calling in all these out-of-state so-called experts who knew nothing about the Alamo, nothing about what it means to Texas” was Bush’s first mistake, according to Range, a retired firefighter, in an interview with the Texas Monthly. \n\n“He cannot be trusted with the future of the Alamo,” Range told the magazine. “He’s flip-flopped more times than a catfish stranded on the bank of a river.”\n\nDespite the criticisms, Bush prominently features images of the Alamo in his campaign ads, which also include several references to Trump’s domestic policy greatest hits. \n\nIn his latest ad, Bush reminds viewers that he is a former Navy officer deployed to Afghanistan, and promises to finish “Trump’s wall.” He is filmed in dark glasses riding an all-terrain vehicle in the shadow of the wall that marks the southern border with Mexico. \n\n“It’s such bulls–t,” said Patterson. “Every damned politician talks about the wall, but the attorney general has no impact on shutting down the border. It’s all bulls–t. It’s almost what you have to do if you are a Republican in Texas.”\n\nStill, Patterson, like others, is hesitant to write off Bush just yet.\n\n“Do I think he has a chance?” he said. “I think he has a chance.”\n\nBush’s campaign and spokesman did not return The Post’s calls and emails Thursday.']",,Save The Alamo Committee,,,"[{'percentage': '5.2E-5', 'age': '18-24', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.246022', 'age': '55-64', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.000835', 'age': '45-54', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.00047', 'age': '35-44', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.002974', 'age': '55-64', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.004278', 'age': '65+', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.04476', 'age': '35-44', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.174709', 'age': '65+', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.109865', 'age': '45-54', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.000365', 'age': '25-34', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.260994', 'age': '65+', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.09771', 'age': '55-64', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.025979', 'age': '45-54', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.01805', 'age': '25-34', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.002243', 'age': '18-24', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.007512', 'age': '35-44', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.002556', 'age': '25-34', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.000626', 'age': '18-24', 'gender': 'female'}]",Save the Alamo,187713745097888,696065088204725,1000001,,25000,29999,0,99

193,"['A two-page condensed Expose’ of the Exceptional Christian History of Western Civilization and the United States of America, by Apenniesworth. (8 min. read)\n\nMany Martyrs gave their lives in the 14 and 1500s wrestling the Bible from the hands of concentrated power. Kings, Priests, and Aristocracy held absolute rule over the common person, we were just serfs and peasants, there was no autonomy (The right to choose how one would live their own life or what they would think and believe.) The common person was destitute, poor, and enslaved in serfdom with an average life expectancy of 40 years.\n\nIn 1384, ""The Morning Star of the Reformation"", John Wycliffe wrote in the prologue to his translation of the Bible, “The Bible is for the Government of the People, by the People, and for the People”. (A very famous phrase adopted by Lincoln at the Gettysburg Address) The public gaining access to the Bible ended much illiteracy because everybody wanted to read the Word of God for themselves. In 1440 Johann Gutenberg, a devout Christian, revolutionized printing with the movable type printing press and delivered the first printed book the Bible to the common person fueling the Reformation of the 1500s.\n\nIn the early Modern Era (1600s) they found the Bible to be rational, logical, and natural, therefore they reasoned if God’s Word is rational and logical his creation must be rational and logical, and we can come to rational and logical conclusions about the world we live in. (Baconian Principle). These concepts fostered the birth of science and the end of much superstition, religious or otherwise. This Ideal facilitated many great Christians at the foundations of our Western Tradition: John Locke the Father of Classic Liberalism, (individual rights, property rights, free markets, religious tolerance self determination and personal responsibility). Sir Isaac Newton the Father of Physics and author of “Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica” still thought to be one of the greatest works of all time. Newton\'s methods are still in use today and of interesting note he wrote more books on theology than math. Sir Francis Bacon the Father of the Scientific Method. Sir Robert Boyle the Father of modern Chemistry, The Reverend Thomas Reid the Father of the Intellectual movement called Scottish Common-Sense Realism. (Influential for 200 years plus in the West) The Reverend John Witherspoon disseminated Realism into American thought. He was the President at Princeton University, Signer of the Declaration of Independence and teacher of many of the Founders of our Nation including James Madison ""The Father of the Constitution"". Madison\'s Bible is loaded with personal notes. All these fountainheads included hundreds not mentioned in this short article quoted the Bible and defended the Faith.\n\nThe Pilgrims in 1620, a congregation of Separatist seeking freedom of religion ventured to the New World. They tried communal living and their governor William Bradford wisely gave up on the idea before they all starved to death and instituted private ownership. Their Pastor William Brewster also produced the Mayflower Compact, one of the first attempts at self-governance and democracy in our country.\n\nThe Reverend Thomas Hooker who some historians called the “Father of American Democracy” put forth unprecedented democratic principles that inspired ideas of individual rights, such as: ""due process of law,"" ""trial by a jury of peers,"" ""no taxation without representation"" and prohibitions against ""cruel and unusual punishment."" He was instrumental in the creation of the first constitution, “The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut” in 1639. It later became a model for all other constitutions in the colonies, including the United States Constitution.\n\nThe Reverend John Wise also said to be the Father of American Democracy by some historians of the past wrote “A Vindication of the Government of New-England Churches” in 1717 and many pamphlets in the early 1700s. Before and during the struggle for Independence his material was reprinted and circulated. Thomas Jefferson included many of the Rev. Wise’s concepts in the Declaration of Independence. The Rev. Wise demonstrated from the Bible that; God created all men equal and every man must be acknowledged by the state as equal to every man. The end of all good government is to promote the happiness of all and the good of every man in all his rights: his life, liberty, estate, honor, etc. The consent of the governed is the only legitimate basis for government. Taxation without representation is tyranny. Many of these are part of what was called Natural Law, Self-Evident Truths, and Natural and Unalienable Rights.\n\nThe ""First Great Awakening"" a Christian grass roots movement of the Mid 1700s solidified the Idea of freedom of Conscience. They reasoned that the government or even the church could not stand before God for you so a person’s moral and religious decisions were personal, and the government should stay out of it. The idea of a individual being responsible toward God is at the foundation of our concept of individual rights. The prevailing belief that there would be a day of reckoning also stifled much corruption in our religious self-regulating culture. They added the fact that Jesus let people accept or reject his message and never persecuted anyone that disagreed with him to bolster their argument for tolerance and disestablishmentarianism. Jesus\'s teachings were thought to be perfect Natural Law especially the ""Sermon on the Mount"" even by non-believers and Deists throughout history, Immanuel Kant for instance (An influential philosopher).\n\nDuring the revolutionary period the Black Robed Regiment (Preachers) preached fiery sermons ""Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God"" and “No king but King Jesus”. The shot for freedom heard around the world was said to be fired in Lexington, Massachusetts where the towns militia from the local church and their Deacon the famous Captain Parker fought.\n\nThe ""Second Great Awakening” another Christian grass roots movement of the 1790s placed greater emphasis on man’s ability to change their situation for the better. In the belly of humanity, contemplating equality, liberty and freedom the worldwide practice of institutionalized slavery was questioned for the first time in history by government. In 1777 the State of Vermont became the first sovereign state to abolish slavery. All the Northern States abolished slavery with-in 20 years of our Constitution and fought and won a war that ended it nationwide with-in 80 years, remarkable compared to the history of the world. Out of this Christian movement came the “Benevolent Empire” in which women also became highly active in the cause of social reform and were considered a partner rather than subservient to men. The Reverend Charles Finney President of Oberlin College and influential in this movement was one of the first to give degrees to minorities and women in the early 1800s and worked in the Underground Railroad to free the slaves. A famous European historian and philosopher from this period Alexis de Tocqueville wrote ""Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and power.""\n\nThe schoolbooks in America were full of Bible TRUTHS from the New England Primer to McGuffey’s Readers to Webster’s Blue-Back Speller for 300 years! The bestselling law books were also full of Biblical references such as Blackstone\'s commentaries on English Law and Locke\'s two Treatises on the Law. Prayer and the Ten Commandments were in our schools until the 1980s. and the Bible itself was read in schools until the 1960s.\n\nAfter the Civil War the “Social Gospel Movement” was born. They believed Christians should work for the betterment of humankind. You will recognize many names of organizations still around from this period like the Salvation Army and the YMCA (The birthplace of the Christian sports Basketball and Volleyball). They were heavily involved in the Progressive movement, fought for child labor laws, unions, and women’s rights, and were still active into the civil rights era of the 1960s on both sides of the political aisle. The Supreme Court in a unanimous decision declared that the historical record demonstrated that the United States is a Christian nation. (A Christian People) (Holy Trinity v. United States, 1892) If the founders were not Christian then why did all the States require a profession of Christianity to hold office, some even until 1961? (Not that I agree with Religious tests)\n\nPost Modern academics believe they can reshape our “repressed primitive animal natures” and create a Socialist Utopia through the power of education and a coolie cutter equity. They would free us from slavery to the ""Industrial State"" to enslave us all to an Inefficient Bureaucracy and Big Government Elitist getting rich on our tax dollars and telling us all what to think, believe and how to live. Cultural Marxist believe that they can control thought through controlling language thus Political Correctness was born and they believe history shapes culture so our heritage must be defamed. \n\nPost-Modern Neo-Marxist PHDs hate the Bible because it promotes many western norms and morals that are directly opposed to the Current Intellectual Oligarchy\'s: Post-Modern Existentialism, Neo-Marxist Critical Theory, Dialectical Materialism and Legal Positivism. Ever since the self-regulating effects of the Bible and God have been pushed from the public forum every bad statistic imaginable has gotten extremely worse from record STDs to 800% increases in incarcerations, Drug Abuse, Overdoses, Divorce, to Suicides just to name a few, but they still push their Godless agenda forward no matter the consequences!  Historically just compare the restraint of the Christian Lockean American Revolution to the Bloody Secular Rousseauian French Revolution of the same era which the intellectuals idolize that ended in despotism, murder. starvation and death! (As ALL the many Socialist experiments have!) These differing philosophies have clashed throughout history, you could even say the Two World Wars and the Cold War were fought over these differing concepts of government. We now fight this battle of ideas from with-in, our ideological enemy has gained enough strength to openly challenge our freedoms and is just as cunning as it ever has been if not more!\n\nRead the best seller of all time and year after year the life changing Bible, endorsed by millions through-out history. When too much partying enslaved me to drugs, alcohol and any selfish urge the Bible\'s truths broke the chains of bondage and led me to true freedom! Start your journey in the Gospel of John and the book of Romans to get started, they will give you an idea what the Bible is all about, the love of God and the redemption of humanity. 1st Corinthians 15:1-4 condenses the whole message. Faith in this message will open the door to true freedom which is God\'s Spirit of love in your heart. For a troubled soul read Romans Chapter 8 multiple times a day.\n\nMy website: https://2moresense.com/\n\na surprise: https://youtu.be/hjZ_IlP9c5A']",['Exposing the rising Post-Modern Neo-Marxist Cult and setting the record straight on American Exceptional Christian History!

BUSH MAY KILL FAMILY’S POLITICAL DYNASTY\n\nPlease see the excellent article by Isabel Vincent that just came out in the NEW YORK POST on March 4 describing the potential downfall of George P. Bush. The piece goes into quite a bit of detail about the impact that ALL OF US have had in the fight to Save the Alamo.\n\nYou can press this link to see the original. https://nypost.com/2022/03/04/george-p-bush-may-end-familys-political-dynasty-in-texas/\n\nWe have also posted the full article below.\n\n********************************************************************\n \nAlamo-disrespecting George P. Bush may kill family’s political dynasty\nBy Isabel Vincent\nMarch 4, 2022 7:40am\nNEW YORK POST \n \nAt first glance, George Prescott Bush seems the ideal political candidate in a state where his family has been a powerful dynasty for decades.\n\nThe telegenic Texas lawyer is a grandson of 41st US President George H.W. Bush and the nephew of George W. Bush, the 43rd. He is the eldest son of two-term Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the great-grandson of US Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut. The war veteran and father of two, married to blond lawyer Amanda Williams Bush, is also Mexican American on his mother’s side, and speaks fluent Spanish.\n\nBut that might not be enough, according to critics who accuse him of being the black sheep of the family and disrespecting the Alamo, Texas’ most treasured symbol, by bringing in modern-minded out-of-staters for its restoration.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bush, 45, and incumbent Ken Paxton beat two other Republican candidates vying to be the party’s pick in the attorney general’s race.\n\nNow, a critical May runoff will determine whether the fourth-generation scion will be able to shore up the family’s political legacy in the Lone Star State, analysts say. \n\nBut that’s another problem: “The Bush name is not popular in Texas anymore,” Luke Twombly, a Dallas-based political consultant and former communications director of the Texas Republican Party, told The Post.\n\nPaxton, the Texas attorney general since 2015, has been indicted on securities fraud charges and accused of bribery and misuse of office in a civil whistleblower lawsuit, but still has the support of the state’s conservatives. He also has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump — a situation Bush hopes to reverse by invoking Trump in his campaign ads, which don’t mention the titans in his own family.\n\n“Under the leadership of President Trump, our country was strong and vibrant again,” says Bush in a campaign video. At another point in the ad, he notes, “Like President Trump, I will not sit idly by while our freedoms are under attack, because Texas must lead the way in fighting this radical agenda.” \n\nIf Bush is trying to capitalize on his devotion to Trump, his opponents hope to end the Bush family’s political dominance in Texas, which began after George H.W. moved with his wife, Barbara, from Connecticut to the Lone Star State in 1948 to work in the oil business.\n\n“If conservatives unite … we can end the Bush dynasty,” Paxton told a Lubbock radio station Wednesday. “The Bushes have had their chances. It’s time for the dynasty to end.”\n\nBush, commissioner of the General Land Office in Texas, has faced withering criticism from both Democrats and fellow Republicans for his work restoring the Alamo historic site. He’s also been under scrutiny for his agency’s administration of veterans’ homes, where the COVID fatality rate was 25 percent at seven out of nine facilities — more than double the rate at the state’s other nursing homes during the height of the pandemic.\n\nIn his eagerness to seek endorsements from Trump, Bush has broken with members of his own family, becoming the black sheep of a clan that has little patience for Trump’s hold on the Republican Party. \n\n“I can’t imagine that George P. is getting a lot of love from his family in pursuit of the Trump endorsement,” said Twombly.\n\nAlthough he likely needs Trump’s endorsement to win the race, others say Bush lacks the same leadership genes that propelled his relatives to political victory.\n\n“Well, maybe he’s not exactly a black sheep, but Bush is not the guy,” Jerry Patterson, Bush’s predecessor on the General Land Office, told The Post. “I knew 41 and 43, and Bush is not a guy who is a leader. He’s a decent enough fellow, but if you want someone to make hard decisions, he’s out of it. He avoids controversy, puts his head down.”\n\nAs commissioner of the GLO, he has played fast and loose with the Alamo, the state’s most sacred historic site, he added. Patterson was so incensed with what he called Bush’s lack of transparency and bungling of the monument’s restoration that he decided to run against him to get his old job back in 2018.\n\nWhen Patterson lost to Bush in the Republican primary for the commissioner’s job, he decided to back Bush’s Democratic opponent, Miguel Suazo, in the commissioner’s race. He wasn’t the only one.\n\n“Never in my memory have all primary opponents of a Republican candidate either endorsed the primary winner’s Democratic opponent or stated publicly they wouldn’t vote for the Republican primary winner,” Patterson said.\n\nIn addition to Patterson, losing Republican primary opponents in the race — Rick Range, Davey Edward and David Watts — all refused to back Bush.\n\n“There are things that are more important than your party,” said Patterson, who ran the GLO between 2003 and 2015. “The Alamo is Texas.”\n\nAmong the criticisms of Bush’s work on the restoration of the site, which will include a new museum with a rooftop garden, is a lack of transparency and the hiring of a Philadelphia design firm that suggested incorporating modern glass walls.\n\n“Calling in all these out-of-state so-called experts who knew nothing about the Alamo, nothing about what it means to Texas” was Bush’s first mistake, according to Range, a retired firefighter, in an interview with the Texas Monthly. \n\n“He cannot be trusted with the future of the Alamo,” Range told the magazine. “He’s flip-flopped more times than a catfish stranded on the bank of a river.”\n\nDespite the criticisms, Bush prominently features images of the Alamo in his campaign ads, which also include several references to Trump’s domestic policy greatest hits. \n\nIn his latest ad, Bush reminds viewers that he is a former Navy officer deployed to Afghanistan, and promises to finish “Trump’s wall.” He is filmed in dark glasses riding an all-terrain vehicle in the shadow of the wall that marks the southern border with Mexico. \n\n“It’s such bulls–t,” said Patterson. “Every damned politician talks about the wall, but the attorney general has no impact on shutting down the border.

BUSH MAY KILL FAMILY’S POLITICAL DYNASTY\n\nPlease see the excellent article by Isabel Vincent that just came out in the NEW YORK POST on March 4 describing the potential downfall of George P. Bush. The piece goes into quite a bit of detail about the impact that ALL OF US have had in the fight to Save the Alamo.\n\nYou can press this link to see the original. https://nypost.com/2022/03/04/george-p-bush-may-end-familys-political-dynasty-in-texas/\n\nWe have also posted the full article below.\n\n********************************************************************\n \nAlamo-disrespecting George P. Bush may kill family’s political dynasty\nBy Isabel Vincent\nMarch 4, 2022 7:40am\nNEW YORK POST \n \nAt first glance, George Prescott Bush seems the ideal political candidate in a state where his family has been a powerful dynasty for decades.\n\nThe telegenic Texas lawyer is a grandson of 41st US President George H.W. Bush and the nephew of George W. Bush, the 43rd. He is the eldest son of two-term Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the great-grandson of US Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut. The war veteran and father of two, married to blond lawyer Amanda Williams Bush, is also Mexican American on his mother’s side, and speaks fluent Spanish.\n\nBut that might not be enough, according to critics who accuse him of being the black sheep of the family and disrespecting the Alamo, Texas’ most treasured symbol, by bringing in modern-minded out-of-staters for its restoration.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bush, 45, and incumbent Ken Paxton beat two other Republican candidates vying to be the party’s pick in the attorney general’s race.\n\nNow, a critical May runoff will determine whether the fourth-generation scion will be able to shore up the family’s political legacy in the Lone Star State, analysts say. \n\nBut that’s another problem: “The Bush name is not popular in Texas anymore,” Luke Twombly, a Dallas-based political consultant and former communications director of the Texas Republican Party, told The Post.\n\nPaxton, the Texas attorney general since 2015, has been indicted on securities fraud charges and accused of bribery and misuse of office in a civil whistleblower lawsuit, but still has the support of the state’s conservatives. He also has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump — a situation Bush hopes to reverse by invoking Trump in his campaign ads, which don’t mention the titans in his own family.\n\n“Under the leadership of President Trump, our country was strong and vibrant again,” says Bush in a campaign video. At another point in the ad, he notes, “Like President Trump, I will not sit idly by while our freedoms are under attack, because Texas must lead the way in fighting this radical agenda.” \n\nIf Bush is trying to capitalize on his devotion to Trump, his opponents hope to end the Bush family’s political dominance in Texas, which began after George H.W. moved with his wife, Barbara, from Connecticut to the Lone Star State in 1948 to work in the oil business.\n\n“If conservatives unite … we can end the Bush dynasty,” Paxton told a Lubbock radio station Wednesday. “The Bushes have had their chances. It’s time for the dynasty to end.”\n\nBush, commissioner of the General Land Office in Texas, has faced withering criticism from both Democrats and fellow Republicans for his work restoring the Alamo historic site. He’s also been under scrutiny for his agency’s administration of veterans’ homes, where the COVID fatality rate was 25 percent at seven out of nine facilities — more than double the rate at the state’s other nursing homes during the height of the pandemic.\n\nIn his eagerness to seek endorsements from Trump, Bush has broken with members of his own family, becoming the black sheep of a clan that has little patience for Trump’s hold on the Republican Party. \n\n“I can’t imagine that George P. is getting a lot of love from his family in pursuit of the Trump endorsement,” said Twombly.\n\nAlthough he likely needs Trump’s endorsement to win the race, others say Bush lacks the same leadership genes that propelled his relatives to political victory.\n\n“Well, maybe he’s not exactly a black sheep, but Bush is not the guy,” Jerry Patterson, Bush’s predecessor on the General Land Office, told The Post. “I knew 41 and 43, and Bush is not a guy who is a leader. He’s a decent enough fellow, but if you want someone to make hard decisions, he’s out of it. He avoids controversy, puts his head down.”\n\nAs commissioner of the GLO, he has played fast and loose with the Alamo, the state’s most sacred historic site, he added. Patterson was so incensed with what he called Bush’s lack of transparency and bungling of the monument’s restoration that he decided to run against him to get his old job back in 2018.\n\nWhen Patterson lost to Bush in the Republican primary for the commissioner’s job, he decided to back Bush’s Democratic opponent, Miguel Suazo, in the commissioner’s race. He wasn’t the only one.\n\n“Never in my memory have all primary opponents of a Republican candidate either endorsed the primary winner’s Democratic opponent or stated publicly they wouldn’t vote for the Republican primary winner,” Patterson said.\n\nIn addition to Patterson, losing Republican primary opponents in the race — Rick Range, Davey Edward and David Watts — all refused to back Bush.\n\n“There are things that are more important than your party,” said Patterson, who ran the GLO between 2003 and 2015. “The Alamo is Texas.”\n\nAmong the criticisms of Bush’s work on the restoration of the site, which will include a new museum with a rooftop garden, is a lack of transparency and the hiring of a Philadelphia design firm that suggested incorporating modern glass walls.\n\n“Calling in all these out-of-state so-called experts who knew nothing about the Alamo, nothing about what it means to Texas” was Bush’s first mistake, according to Range, a retired firefighter, in an interview with the Texas Monthly. \n\n“He cannot be trusted with the future of the Alamo,” Range told the magazine. “He’s flip-flopped more times than a catfish stranded on the bank of a river.”\n\nDespite the criticisms, Bush prominently features images of the Alamo in his campaign ads, which also include several references to Trump’s domestic policy greatest hits. \n\nIn his latest ad, Bush reminds viewers that he is a former Navy officer deployed to Afghanistan, and promises to finish “Trump’s wall.” He is filmed in dark glasses riding an all-terrain vehicle in the shadow of the wall that marks the southern border with Mexico. \n\n“It’s such bulls–t,” said Patterson. “Every damned politician talks about the wall, but the attorney general has no impact on shutting down the border. It’s all bulls–t. It’s almost what you have to do if you are a Republican in Texas.”\n\nStill, Patterson, like others, is hesitant to write off Bush just yet.\n\n“Do I think he has a chance?” he said. “I think he has a chance.”\n\nBush’s campaign and spokesman did not return The Post’s calls and emails Thursday.']",,Save The Alamo Committee,,,"[{'percentage': '0.001302', 'age': '45-54', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.050781', 'age': '35-44', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.000434', 'age': '25-34', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.074653', 'age': '55-64', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.139323', 'age': '65+', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.281684', 'age': '65+', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.24349', 'age': '55-64', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.121528', 'age': '45-54', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.03125', 'age': '25-34', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.000434', 'age': '18-24', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.003906', 'age': '25-34', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.005208', 'age': '65+', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.026042', 'age': '45-54', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.009549', 'age': '35-44', 'gender': 'female'}, {'percentage': '0.005642', 'age': '18-24', 'gender': 'male'}, {'percentage': '0.003906', 'age': '55-64', 'gender': 'unknown'}, {'percentage': '0.000868', 'age': '35-44', 'gender': 'unknown'}]",Save the Alamo,187713745097888,710727373448497,1000001,,3000,3999,0,99
