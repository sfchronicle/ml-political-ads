111,"This weekend I went bass Fishing with my grandson at Santa Maria River, California and he surprised me with a question I never thought he would ask.

‚ÄúGrandpa John... Do you have Life Insurance?‚Äù 

I was taken back for a moment, because what kind of 7 year old would ask such a bold question? 

Rather than answering, I simply asked him what made him think to ask me that. 

He put his head down for a moment before looking at me with one eye squinted and said...

‚ÄúI heard my mom and dad talking about you and they‚Äôre scared that if something happened to you we wouldn‚Äôt have the money to pay the funeral man‚Äù 

I could see he was worried. I told him that everything would be fine and there was nothing to worry about. 

The truth is, I didn‚Äôt have anything in place to protect them if something were to happen to me and they don‚Äôt have $10,000 lying around to cover a sudden funeral cost, either. 

That was my responsibility. One I hadn‚Äôt owned up to yet. 

I returned from our trip the next morning and called my friend who's a Licensed Field Underwriter. I almost paid for another insurance and then he told me that California Residents ages 50-85 years old qualify for a NEW State Regulated Burial Program that is designed to pay for our Final Expenses up to $25,000 Tax Free. 

It was really simple. They approved me almost instantly and they didn‚Äôt even mind that I have some prior health conditions. 

There was no Blood Work Required.

No Physical Exam, No Doctors Appointments or invasive requirements. 

They provided Day One Coverage, even covered my brother who‚Äôs a diabetic that has been turned down for previous coverage. 

Thanks to this program, I was able to tell my grandson and my family that everything will be fine when something happens to me.

116,"""In the newly drawn 5th District, which represents Costa Mesa, a portion of Irvine and South County coastal cities, we enthusiastically back Sen. Pat Bates.
She‚Äôs running against Democratic Supervisor Katrina Foley (who now represents the 2nd District), and two Republicans ‚Äì businesswoman and former Assemblywoman Diane Harkey and Newport Beach Mayor Kevin Muldoon.
Bates certainly has the most impressive resume among all the candidates, having served as state senator since 2014, where she spent two years as Senate Republican Leader. She was on the Board of Supervisors from 2007-2014 and spent six years in the California State Assembly. But our choice isn‚Äôt based solely on her experience.
We‚Äôve closely watched her career and while we‚Äôve sometimes disagreed with her votes, we‚Äôve always been impressed with her thoughtfulness, graciousness and integrity. She operates in a low-key manner that puts the nuts-and-bolts of governing above politicking. The board needs her steady, earnest approach after its series of scandals and oversight failures.
Foley has done yeoman‚Äôs work battling board secrecy, but her endorsement list is a who‚Äôs who of progressive groups and labor unions. Likewise, Harkey and Muldoon both sound like wholly owned subsidiaries of the deputies‚Äô union. By contrast, we know that voters can trust Bates to be an independent and public-spirited voice who isn‚Äôt beholden to anyone.

We urge a vote for Pat Bates for 5th District supervisor.""

BlocPower is a climate technology company with the goal of ‚Äúmaking American cities smarter, greener and healthier‚Äù. The company started in 2014 in Brooklyn, New York and has since retrofitted more than 1,000 buildings in disadvantaged communities in New York City, with more projects occurring in several other US cities.

We will learn about the inspiring story behind Donnel Baird who is BlocPower‚Äôs CEO and founder, why building electrification is essential to mitigating the climate crisis, and the important role Climate Justice plays. Our speaker will also discuss BlocPower‚Äôs business model, their role in the Ithaca electrification effort, and whether these approaches have been used, or could be used in California.

There will be time for questions from the audience. This presentation is being hosted by the North County Climate Change Alliance and the San Diego Building Electrification Coalition.",North County Climate Change Alliance

California Lawmakers Nazarian and Lee Influenced by Animal Extremist Groups

California Lawmakers Introduce Legislation Against Animal Feeding Operations and Processing Facilities

On February 18, 2022, California State Assembly members Nazarian and Lee introduced AB 2764. If passed, this bill will ban new animal feeding operations and processing in the state of California. The legislation will also prohibit feeding operations and processing plants from expanding to meet demand for nutritious animal protein products. If made into law, this would add Chapter 4 to Part 1 of Division 9 of the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to animals.   

This bill was pushed by radical animal extremist groups Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) and Compassionate Bay via their #nomorefactoryfarms campaign.

DxE Celebrates
The radical animal extremist group DxE celebrated the introduction of AB 2764 with a social media post. DxE is a group well known for its animal liberation ideology and agenda. The group has factions across the country where they stage and perform protests, thefts of animals, and mob farm invasions.  Recently the group‚Äôs founder, Wayne Hsuing, was found guilty of trespass and theft.  

Adrin Nazarian
Nazarian is a California State Assembly member representing the 46th district. This district covers the San Fernando Valley and includes Hollywood Hills, Lake Balboa, North Hills, North Hollywood, Panorama City, Sherman Oaks, Studio City, Toluca Lake, Valley Glen, Universal City, Van Nuys, and Valley Village.  
His bio on his official website shows that he has a degree in economics. Therefore, he clearly understands the impact this legislation will have on lawful businesses in the state that help to feed his own constituents.  

Based on numerous articles about Nazarian and his activities is it clear is has aligned and created a strong partnership with radical animal extremist groups like DxE, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PRCM), Animal Hope in Legislation, Animal Legal Defense Fund, Friends of the Earth, Social Compassion in Legislation, and Sierra Club California. He has also received endorsements from Jerry Brown and Kamala Harris who have also pushed legislation that is harmful to rural America, rural property owners, and animal agriculture. His endorsements also include a long list of Hollywood actors known for their affiliations with radical animal extremist groups.  

Vegan School Lunches
Nazarian also authored AB 558, a bill that impacts school lunches, which was pushed by the radical animal extremist group Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. According to an article in Businesswire, ‚ÄúThe bill incentivizes K-12 public schools across the state to offer healthier, climate-friendly plant-based meals and beverages.‚Äù AB 558 passed the California Assembly.

Courtroom Advocates for Animals
Furthermore, Nazarian introduced AB 2645 last year which may be heard in committee in March 2022. If passed, AB 2645 would allow judges to appoint courtroom advocates to animals. This is highly problematic as it provides an opening to providing personhood for animals. The ramifications of this are multifold. The American Veterinary Medical Association has this bill on its watch list with the following statement:

 ‚Äú‚Ä¶. the AVMA will keep a close eye on whether legislation allows for a court to appoint an advocate utilizing the legal standard of in the interests of the animal involved versus the standard of the interests of justice. In the interest of the animal is a different legal standard than in the interest of justice, and they have very different implications. In the interest of justice includes notions of fairness, societal interests for the humane treatment of animals, and the interest of the owner, while in the interest of the animal is an attempt to require courts to apply the same types of standards as they would for a child.‚Äù

Alex Lee
Alex Lee represents California‚Äôs 25th Assembly District. His district covers both Alameda and Santa Clara Counties. It includes the communities of Fremont, Newark, Milpitas, San Jose and Santa Clara. Assembly member Lee was elected in 2020 and has called the San Francisco Bay area home his entire life. Lee was also endorsed by the Sierra Club and his campaign website states he is fighting for enacting the Green New Deal and building sustainable communities.   

His activities show partnership with extremist groups like: Peace 4 Animals, Friends of the Earth, and Social Compassion in Legislation for Animals.  

Lee authored house resolution 61 which alarmingly refers to animal owners as guardians. The American Veterinary Medical Board addressed this very concern in 2005.  This is a small portion of AVMA‚Äôs stance: 

‚ÄúSome animal owners may like to refer to themselves as ""pet guardians,"" however ""guardian"" is a legal term that has significant legal implications and repercussions. Its use to describe the relationship between animals and their owners is inappropriate. Under well-developed principles of guardianship law, guardianship is a fiduciary relationship (the highest legal civil duty owed by one person to another). The ward's interests are always to prevail over those of the guardian. Some conflicts that arise from application of human guardianship law to animals are described in the text that follows. On the basis of these conflicts, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) recommends that ""guardian"" not be adopted, even to semantically describe the relationship between humans and their animals.‚Äù

The American Kennel Club expressed concerns about HR 61 and stated: 
‚ÄúContact the author, Assembly member Alex Lee, and respectfully express your concerns with HR 61. Let him know that you agree that all animals should be treated in a humane and safe manner, and explain how the broad definitions in HR 61 could encompass procedures that are important for your dogs/breed.‚Äù

Why are two California Assembly members who clearly have no background in agriculture and who represent urban and suburban communities writing legislation that will impact agriculture and rural communities? 

Summary of AB 2764
‚ÄúThis bill would prohibit commercial animal feeding operations and slaughterhouses, as defined, from commencing or expanding operations, except as specified. The bill would make any person that violates this prohibition civilly liable for a penalty in an amount not to exceed a sum of $10,000 per violation per day but specify that a violation of this prohibition is not a crime.‚Äù

The Dangers of Food Elitism 
By Jaclyn Krymowski for Protect the Harvest 

Access to adequate food is an extremely important topic. All people deserve to have access to safe and nutritious foods. In today‚Äôs society, there are numerous questions to ask about food, food security and the recent focus on elite foods.  

‚Ä¢ Are various food-focused social justice initiatives really pushing towards the goal of safe, nutritious foods, or are they working to redefine what safe and nutritious means? 
‚Ä¢ Do the groups who are trying to make ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and ‚Äúnutritious‚Äù simultaneous with buzzwords like ‚Äúorganic‚Äù, ‚Äúplant-based‚Äù, and ‚Äúall-natural‚Äù, know what impact their actions have on food equity? 

Food Bullying is a Reality and It Starts with Food Marketers and Their Counterparts, Animal and Environmental Extremists
In her book, Food Bullying, author Michele Payn, points out that people may find themselves selecting certain food products or labels because of how it will make them feel, increase their status, or earn praise from peers. The choices they make aren‚Äôt necessarily derived from nutrition or safety, but from an elitist mindset.

We Support All Forms of Agriculture ‚Äì We Do Not Support Misinforming the Public
There is nothing wrong with providing high quality products to the elite buyer.  We support organic farming and conventional farming.  We also support different types of animal production systems.  What we do not support and believe is morally wrong is the practice of misinforming the public about our food system and the nutritional value of the foods they can afford to provide their families.  

Why Are We Making the Statement that These Groups Are Partners in crime?  
Many of these elite food marketing groups and companies tap into the false narrative established by animal and environmental extremist groups to push their own products.   Elitist marketers and their counterparts, animal and environmental extremist groups, have purposely overlooked and ignored the reality that our modern food systems provide safe, nutritious, humane and most importantly, affordable food.  Through their marketing they repeat the negative disinformation about modern agriculture propagated by animal and environmental extremist groups.   Keep in mind that animal extremists want to end all animal agriculture and view animal ownership as akin to slavery and abuse.   Environmental extremist groups view humankind as a global parasite and they have been pushing this narrative for years.  This provides a convenient, already established narrative that elite food companies and marketers tap into.  Animal and environmental extremist groups are in a sense, saving elite food marketers money since they have already worked to establish a false narrative in which they can use it as a platform to sell their food products.  They use the false narrative designed and marketed by extremist groups to enforce the false notion that vegan and other elite foods are the epitome of good health. 

What is worse is that marketers for elite foods frown upon families who choose products they deem are ‚Äúover-processed"" or ‚Äúunhealthy.‚Äù Not only are these accusations unfounded, but those same families simply don‚Äôt have the money to spend on expensive alternatives. Without affordable animal protein products like eggs, dairy, beef, pork, and poultry, they‚Äôd have no other choice but to go hungry.

Veganism is Elitist and Unhealthy
One of the dangers of the vegan animal extremist ideology is their insistence that their proposed diet is suitable for everyone and entirely ‚Äúnatural.‚Äù  They ignore the facts and put the health of people at risk in favor of their radical ideology.  Animal extremist groups also ignore the stark reality that the animal extremist vegan lifestyle requires some degree of supplementation to meet lacking nutrients found in abundance in animal products like B12, iron and Vitamin D to name a few. Additionally,  vegan meat and dairy substitute products like fake bacon, processed pea patties, fake cheese and juices that are supposed to replace milk, are significantly more expensive compared to wholesome real meat and dairy products.  If those manipulated into following the vegan ideology cannot afford those products they are then only able to afford produce and grain staples.

From a health perspective, vegan diets are not recommended for everyone. Physicians from all over the world have warned against the dangers of vegan diets in children, citing multiple instances of malnutrition and average delayed growth patterns.  In some countries forcing children to eat a vegan diet is considered child abuse and a crime.  

Food Elitism is Not Family Friendly
Unfortunately, years of plentiful eating have blinded a lot of the elite to the fact that so many under-privileged families rely on our affordable and sustainable food system. The trend of companies serving the elite and wealthy have taken advantage of this ignorance in their marketing tactics. 

Most people cannot afford to shop at high-end grocery stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe‚Äôs and types of farmers‚Äô markets. On average, their groceries are about 20% more expensive compared to traditional stores reflecting a privilege of the elite class.

Examples of Nefarious Marketing Tactics Which Mislead the Public
Nefarious food product marketing tactics take many forms.  Many marketing firms and elite food companies use scare tactics to sell their products.  Using false or exaggerated disinformation, their messaging heavily implies that other foods are nutritionally inferior and unsafe compared to certain products that are produced the ‚Äúright‚Äù way. Of course, the ‚Äúright way‚Äù is their way.  Their marketing messaging fully ignores the facts about food safety and the USDA‚Äôs role in ensuring the food items people purchase are safe to consume.  What these marketing tactics don‚Äôt tell people is that conventionally raised meat, eggs and dairy fall under the safest food inspections and regulations in the world. Likewise, they have a very similar nutritional profile to food items which are marketed as  ‚Äúpastured raised‚Äù  or ‚Äúorganic‚Äù. 

These scare tactics can be especially harmful to low-income and underprivileged families who are led to believe that they are not and cannot feed their families properly.

Cooks Venture is an example of elitist marketing and pricing.  They are a food delivery service focused on pasture-raised beef and chicken (they have plans to expand their lineup soon). A 9 to 10-pound box of their assorted beef and chicken cuts goes for $149.99.  By comparison, the average cost per pound of a conventional whole chicken is just $1.70 and beef $4.73.

‚ÄúGood food is vital for health and happiness,‚Äù says their website, heavily implying that their meats are ‚Äògood‚Äô compared to other conventionally raised products. 

The site continues:
‚ÄúDespite the pastoral images and marketing claims, almost all meat today comes from mainstream operations that are labeled with greenwashed buzzwords. Finding food that is good for both us and the planet doesn‚Äôt have to be this hard.‚Äù

While marketing language, this tone is harmful as it reinforces a misconception that is already so rampant among consumers: that products derived from conventional animal agriculture are inferior to niche products sporting labels like ‚Äúgrass-fed‚Äù ‚Äúpasture-raised‚Äù ‚Äúorganic‚Äù or ‚Äúall-natural.‚Äù (Keep in mind that the definitions for some of these are not even officially defined.)

A company with a similar marketing approach is ButcherBox, which says it ‚Äúwas started with the idea that everyone should have access to high-quality, humanely raised meat.‚Äù  But is their $149/month delivered box if 9 to 14 pounds of meat really accessible to everyone?

‚ÄúWe only work with companies and farmers that are dedicated to doing the right thing,‚Äù continues the website, ‚Äúnever cutting corners‚Ä¶‚Äù

This is yet another example of a company which is painting conventional, modern animal agriculture as the enemy.  The goal is to shame the elite into purchasing their products and it fully ignores those who cannot afford the high-end products they are pushing.

Food Insecurity is the Real Issue
Despite being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, Americans still fall into the ‚Äúfood insecure‚Äù category making up about 10.5% of households in 2019, according to data from the Department of Agriculture.  In poorer countries, that number is much higher with some having notable portions of their populations being chronically malnourished.

A pivotal solution to all of this starts, of course, at the farm level. However, the disconnect between large farms, modernization and food equity is unfortunately ongoing. A Global Washington article cites increasing farm efficiency productivity as being necessary to help alleviate the rising cost of food products. This includes ‚Äúa comprehensive approach that includes access to heartier seeds, more effective tools, improved farm management practices, locally relevant knowledge and reliable markets.‚Äù University researchers and livestock veterinarians have dedicated decades to refining modern farming practices to provide humane, sustainable, wholesome, and affordable foods. Large farms, especially those in first-world countries, have embraced the research available to them and implemented modern practices.  Unfortunately, the Global Washington article leaves out the vital role of research and modern farming practices.  Instead, it cites small farms (without defining what that term means) as being part of the solution. 

Diane Sullivan Fights for Food Security
In her testimony before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy on February 6, 2020, food security activist, Diane Sullivan, shared her insight into the real-world implications of food elitism as a mother who has experienced hunger and homelessness.

‚ÄúToo often, food policy debate in this country exclusively takes place among those in power‚Äîelected officials, scholars, researchers, both for-profit and non-profit special interest groups, and more,‚Äù she shared. ‚ÄúRarely are those of us with lived experience in hunger invited to the table when the policies that directly impact our lives are discussed, designed, and implemented. This is increasingly the case as retailers, policymakers, state ballot initiatives, and more press to regulate farmers in such a way that eliminates affordable, safe and nutritious food choices and drives up the cost of our food.‚Äù

Sullivan also commented on the significant role that hardworking farmers and ranchers play in the conventional food system to make food equitable to struggling households. 

‚ÄúMy experience has taught me that productive farmers and ranchers in this country are perhaps among the best friends low-income people could have,‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúThey provide us the broadest choices of safe and affordable food options in the world, so long as they are permitted to do so. As low-income consumers, we remain stuck in the middle of policies that increase the cost of our food‚Ä¶‚Äù

In 2016, Sullivan was the campaign manager for a ballot committee that opposed a ban on sales of meat and eggs from animals raised in large modern farms (Mass Question 3) ‚Äì which is the vast majority of affordable and conventionally raised animal products.

""On so many occasions, I've been in a position where I haven't been able to feed my children an appropriate meal,"" Sullivan shared in an interview for a local publication. ""When my SNAP benefits have run out, my paycheck is still a couple of days away, I've been able to go to the grocery store, gather up a dollar in change, purchase a dozen eggs and feed my children at least a source of protein."" 

She added:
""My passion is driving me. I know what hunger looks and feels like. Who's going to take on an organization like the Humane Society of the United States to defend poor people? Poor people are too often voiceless.""

The Farm Systems Reform Act Will Drive Up the Price of Affordable Food
In addition to recent attacks on affordable food and modern agriculture like Mass Question 3, and California‚Äôs Prop 2, and Prop 12, there are animal extremist influenced politicians continuing to push their ideology while ignoring the impact on American families.  

Considering the average spending of an American family on their monthly grocery bill, and that many are still going hungry, the disruption of the conventional food system ‚Äì particularly animal-derived proteins ‚Äì would be catastrophic. The Farm Systems Reform Act is one of the latest legislative efforts being pushed by vegan extremist, Senator Cory Booker.   This piece of legislation will harm families in the name of food elitism and vegan ideology and it is being done on the national level. 

Animal Extremist Driven State Ballot Initiatives Will Drive up the Price of Affordable Food
In addition to federal legislation, the animal extremist driven state ballot initiatives in Colorado and Oregon  are other new targeted attacks on animal agriculture by animal rights vegan extremists.  They are pushing to eliminate animal protein products from the diets of citizens in those states under a false animal welfare pretense. These initiatives would cripple the states‚Äô animal industries and force an unhealthy diet on growing families by making affordable and nutritious animal protein products prohibitively expensive.

A Balanced Food System
Each year, hundreds of millions of people go hungry around the globe. And, even for those with access to food, many are still deficient in essential vitamins and nutrients. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated over 92% of the population suffers from at least one vitamin or mineral deficiency. At least 10% have a broader type of nutritional deficiency. 

Many of the most common deficiencies found throughout the world can be easily addressed by consuming animal protein products.  Iron deficiency, for example, affects over 25% of the world. A single three-ounce serving of ground beef (one of the most affordable beef products) covers almost 30% of the recommended daily value for iron.

Because vitamin B12 absorption decreases with age, many older adults (an estimated 20% of them) are deficient in this vitamin. Meat, milk and eggs are all abundant, accessible sources.

These are just a few brief examples of vitamins that are essential and found easily in animal products.

Modern Agriculture Provides Affordable, Nutritious and Sustainable Food
Modern agriculture, including livestock production, makes food affordable, is more sustainable, helps to control food byproduct waste, and decreases food disparity among households. Americans today only spend less than 10% of their income on food. For poorer nations (and low-income American households) that percentage is easily 40%, in some cases much more than that. 

Modern, state of the art practices in American agriculture have been developed to feed citizens efficiently and affordably. Everything in our food system ‚Äì from research to farming practices to subsidies ‚Äì all reflect this mindset. Not only are nutritious foods plentiful and accessible, but they also empower consumers with freedom of choice.

The pursuit of an equitable food system should be about offering more, not less, choices to consumers to meet their dietary needs. Restricting them with only expensive alternatives is food elitism that leaves so many vulnerable families to struggle with life‚Äôs most basic necessities.

193,"This weekend I went bass Fishing with my grandson at Santa Maria River, California and he surprised me with a question I never thought he would ask.

‚ÄúGrandpa John... Do you have Life Insurance?‚Äù 

I was taken back for a moment, because what kind of 7 year old would ask such a bold question? 

Rather than answering, I simply asked him what made him think to ask me that. 

He put his head down for a moment before looking at me with one eye squinted and said...

‚ÄúI heard my mom and dad talking about you and they‚Äôre scared that if something happened to you we wouldn‚Äôt have the money to pay the funeral man‚Äù 

I could see he was worried. I told him that everything would be fine and there was nothing to worry about. 

The truth is, I didn‚Äôt have anything in place to protect them if something were to happen to me and they don‚Äôt have $10,000 lying around to cover a sudden funeral cost, either. 

That was my responsibility. One I hadn‚Äôt owned up to yet. 

I returned from our trip the next morning and called my friend who's a Licensed Field Underwriter. I almost paid for another insurance and then he told me that California Residents ages 50-85 years old qualify for a NEW State Regulated Burial Program that is designed to pay for our Final Expenses up to $25,000 Tax Free. 

It was really simple. They approved me almost instantly and they didn‚Äôt even mind that I have some prior health conditions. 

There was no Blood Work Required.

No Physical Exam, No Doctors Appointments or invasive requirements. 

They provided Day One Coverage, even covered my brother who‚Äôs a diabetic that has been turned down for previous coverage. 

Thanks to this program, I was able to tell my grandson and my family that everything will be fine when something happens to me.

I grew up in Stockton. I went to school at Tokay High and Delta College before getting a degree in Neurobiology from UC Davis. I am the son of two Sikh immigrant parents who started their own small business and achieved the American dream. I want to make sure future generations can do the same. 

I organized coalitions for the Green New Deal, cheaper student housing, and demilitarizing our police. I organized for a mobile crisis intervention program in Stockton that will respond to non-violent emergencies instead of armed police officers. As an elected officer in my local union, I raised relief funds for our undocumented neighbors during the pandemic. 

Corporations that continue to abuse workers and rip off customers already have plenty of politicians in Washington D.C. But I am not your boss's politician. 

I forged my politics through union and grassroots organizing, fighting to give a voice to everyday folks.

201,"Surveys have found that less than 5% of marijuana businesses today are owned by Black Americans, even in states with ""social equity"" programs like California.

That‚Äôs because starting any business requires money upfront to pay for security consultants, equipment, and rent while dealing with investors and incubators doing their best to fleece applicants. That means these businesses are started by people who already have access to the necessary resources.

If we are serious about helping poor and working-class Americans, we must do the much harder task of taking on our economic elites and making sure they aren‚Äôt the only ones to benefit from legalization.

That‚Äôs why I support nationalizing the marijuana industry.

Legal sales of marijuana are expected to exceed $43 billion by the end of 2025. That is with weed being illegal in many states. Even in states where it is legal, illicit sales still make up a significant part of all sales.

A nationalized industry would bring in billions in revenue to pay for much needed social services. Services that would actually lift millions of Americans out of poverty and deliver real material benefits to people‚Äôs lives.

We can prioritize jobs in the industry to go to nonviolent drug offenders. We could contract growing cooperatives that are worker run and worker owned. We can make sure a substance that was used to terrorize and ruin the lives of so many of our sisters and brothers will now be used to better their lives instead.

205,"S2A Modular is hosting a webinar on Thursday, April 28th for investors in your area to learn about Smart Home construction integrated with renewable energy modular technology.

The webinar will break down the differences between the ""traditional stick built"" method of construction versus the ""modular"" method. You'll learn the advantages and disadvantages of the modular process along with how we're integrating renewable energy smart home components to create net-zero (NZEB) properties. The heart of the concept is the inclusion of a residential storage battery, such as the Tesla Powerwall for example and revolutionary solar panel systems, while adding high energy-efficient windows, doors, insulation, heating, etc. to maximize the battery's use.

Who is this webinar for?
1. The buyer who is looking to build a new home and would like to get the process done 30%-40% faster at a cost savings of 10%-20% of the original stick built method while building a stronger product.
2. The consumer who is interested in sustainability, renewable energy, smart home technology, energy-efficient home components integrated with green living.
3. The ""Developer"" that wants to build a community or subdivision of hundreds of homes and/or the developer that wants to build apartment or hotel doors quicker, stronger and for less money.
4. The accredited investor that would like to be involved at the start of something that could quickly grow and potentially disrupt an industry.
5. The strategic investor who wants to partner with a company not only to get a strong ROI on their investment but to have priority on the assembly line and a discount from normal mark-up.
6. The construction professional, the architect, the salesperson, the civil engineer, the supplier of building materials and anyone else that may want to learn more about modular construction and smart home technology and how to partner with S2A Modular. 

Organizer
Brian Kuzdas started his real estate career in 1985 as a commercial real estate agent in Chicago, Illinois. After representing buyers and sellers for 12 years, Brian bought his first apartment building in 1997 with the intention to convert it into condominiums.

After the success of that first apartment conversion, over the next ten years (1998-2007), Brian bought 4,000+ apartments and converted all of them to condos.

When the recession hit in 2007, Brian shifted to helping banks auction their foreclosed inventory (REOs). By 2010, Brian bought ""RealEstateAuctions"" (REA) and expanded the company to fourteen states while moving the corporate office to Palo Alto, CA in 2012.

In 2017, Brian opened an acquisition division to develop 10,000+ modular renewable energy smart homes that run off of a storage battery creating net-zero (NZEB), in California, and throughout the entire world.

He will be joined by Dean DeLisle, Chief Revenue Officer of S2A Modular. Dean has been marketing, home building, mortgage and the Real Estate industry for over 30 years.",

207,"Here are the top 10 questions our staff has received regarding the OCPA:

1. What is the Orange County Power Authority (OCPA)? 
The OCPA (established in 2020) is an independent, locally governed, not-for-profit Community Choice Energy Provider of electricity for all residential and commercial customers in Irvine, Fullerton, Huntington Beach, Buena Park, and the unincorporated areas of Orange County. 
 
2. Is it true that Irvine taxpayer money is funding the OCPA?
Yes. The former City Council entered into an agreement for the City of Irvine to fund the OCPA through 2022. So far, $7.7 million of Irvine taxpayer money has been advanced to the OCPA.
 
3. Where has the $7.7 million of Irvine taxpayer money gone?
We don't know. The OCPA has not provided the City of Irvine with any detailed financial information regarding purchasing agreements or the hiring of staff, consultants, and lawyers. According to the agency's website, the Power Authority's projected loss for 2022 will be $23 million and $17 million the following year (2023).
 
4. Am I being enrolled in the OCPA without my expressed permission?
Yes. The City of Irvine has joined the OCPA. As a result, all businesses operating in the City of Irvine are being transferred this month from their current provider of electricity, Southern California Edison (SCE) and enrolled in the new OCPA plan. Later this year ‚Äî in October ‚Äî all Irvine residential customers will be transferred from SCE to OCPA.
 
5. Will we pay less for electricity under the OCPA plan?
No. The business and residential plans selected by the City of Irvine are more expensive than SCE. Residential customers will pay as much as 6% more for electricity than they currently pay to SCE. Commercial customers will also pay more ... unless they ""opt-down"" to the 38% renewable rate, which will cost the same as SCE.
 
6. Will we get electricity derived from 100% renewable sources?
No. The electricity you receive from OCPA will remain the same to every household and business. It will be provided to your home through SCE transmission lines. However, the expectation is that the money you pay into OCPA will be used to purchase cleaner energy down the road.
 
7. Has OCPA followed through on its promise to create local sustainable programs?
No, not yet. Although the Power Agency's website states that local sustainable programs will be created, our staff has been unable to find any such programs that have been established in the first two years of the agency's existence.
 
8. Can I stay with SCE?
Yes. Businesses can ""opt-out"" within five days of being transferred out of SCE and enrolled in OCPA by calling 1-866-262-7693. Once residents receive their enrollment notice ‚Äî which is expected to be mailed out sometime in August ‚Äî they will be able to call the same phone number to opt-out of OCPA and remain with SCE.
 
9. Is OCPA installing their own electric power lines?
No. SCE will continue to maintain the grid, repair power lines, and provide Irvine customers one consolidated utility bill that includes OCPA electric generation charges and SCE electric delivery charges.
 
10. What happens if the OCPA fails?
If the OCPA fails, commercial and residential customers will be transferred back to SCE. As far as the $7.7 million of Irvine taxpayer money that has been advanced to the OCPA so far, at the November 9, 2021 Council meeting, the Irvine City Attorney said the City ""will not get repaid.""",Irvine Community News & Views
208,"Although City Council elections here in Irvine are nonpartisan by law, Mayor Farrah Khan runs her campaigns as a partisan Democrat.

However, it appears that Khan is facing increasing opposition from local Democrats. In fact, just last month the local Democratic club in Irvine overwhelmingly voted not to provide an early endorsement for her November Mayoral re-election campaign. (Khan received less than 25% support from Democratic club members in Irvine.)

Before the vote was taken, Irvine Democratic activists ‚Äî who had campaigned, donated and voted for Khan in 2020 ‚Äî rattled off a number of instances where the Mayor had defied the Democratic Party‚Äôs core values, including:

1. As Mayor, Khan has instituted the Rule of Two, which directly contradicts a resolution passed by the Democratic Party of Orange County, mandating that elected Democrats provide a ‚Äúsecond‚Äù to any agenda item submitted by a fellow Democrat.
 
2. Khan blocked Council discussion on district elections (even though district elections are part of the California Democratic Party‚Äôs platform).
 
3. The Mayor attempted to dismantle the City‚Äôs transparency-focused ‚ÄúSunshine Ordinance‚Äù by limiting public notification of Council agendas and moving ‚ÄúPublic Comments‚Äù at Council meetings to the very end, when the Council chamber is basically empty. (After public outcry, Khan was forced to move public comments to the beginning of meetings.)
 
4. In 2020, Khan promised veterans and their families that she would honor the citizens‚Äô initiative ‚Äî signed by nearly 20,000 Irvine residents ‚Äî to move forward with the Veterans Memorial Park & Cemetery on the ARDA site at the Great Park. However, once elected, Khan banished the voter-approved Veterans Cemetery from Irvine altogether. She even went out of her way to reject popular plans to start building a Veterans Memorial Park.

Something that should make every Democrat cringe is the fact that Khan appointed a notorious Armenian Genocide denier to her Mayor‚Äôs Advisory Council. And, she was caught on video telling members of the Turkish community that she stood with them ‚Äúno matter what,‚Äù and then went on to participate in a joke about making Armenians ‚Äúdisappear.‚Äù

When the video became public a few weeks ago, Khan issued a defiant statement saying the video had been ‚Äúdoctored‚Äù by campaign rivals. After multiple sources confirmed the authenticity of the video, Khan was forced to issue an apology.

During the April 12th City Council meeting, dozens from within the Armenian community provided public comments. Many spoke passionately about losing relatives in the Armenian Genocide, which took place during World War I when 1.5 million Armenians were killed by the Turkish government.

One speaker referenced his disgust with the Democratic Party‚Äôs support of Khan. After the Irvine Democratic club had voted not to endorse the Mayor, Democratic Party bosses in Anaheim rushed through an early endorsement of Khan, months before the official candidate filing period opens. Clearly, these Democratic Party bosses sense that Mayor Khan is in serious political trouble here in Irvine ‚Äî a city that prides itself on being one of the most diverse, thoroughly integrated communities in America.

On April 14th, the Southern California Armenian Democrats released a statement on Facebook saying that Khan has still not met with Armenian community leaders, and calling on Democratic elected officials to rescind their endorsement of the Mayor.

I can‚Äôt help but wonder if the Democratic Party and the Democratic elected officials who have publicly endorsed Mayor Khan would continue to support her if she had been filmed joking with (and appointing to her inner circle of advisors) a Holocaust denier or an individual who regularly bashes the LGBTQ+ community.

Several political consultants, speaking on condition of anonymity, have referred to Khan as increasingly ‚Äútoxic.‚Äù According to one longtime Democratic Party consultant, active in many Los Angeles and Orange County campaigns: ‚ÄúKhan has become radioactive. Orange County Democrats who hold state or federal office are going to be rethinking their endorsements of Khan for fear that their association with her will hurt every Democratic candidate on the ballot in November.‚Äù",Irvine Community News & Views

233,"Martinez property tax measure would save scenic ridgeline 
- by Shomik Mukherjee - Bay Area News Group
https://tinyurl.com/EastBayTimesArticle
 Just a mile from the historic home of revered naturalist John Muir lies the kind of scenic wilderness he spent his life fighting to conserve ‚Äî 297 acres of a grassy, oak covered ridgeline landscape known as the Alhambra Hills.

For more than a decade, Richfield Real Estate Corp. has held onto city permits that allow it to build 109 single-family homes on 70 acres of the property on the southern edge of town.

But instead of building, the Texas-based property manager held off for myriad reasons over the years and agreed in March to sell the land to the city for $19.25 million so it can be preserved permanently.

To raise that kind of money, the city has placed a property tax measure on the June 7 ballot. If Measure F is passed by a two-thirds vote, owners of single-family parcels would pay $79 a
year and those of nonresidential properties from $150 to $600 over the next three decades.

While the tax is estimated to generate $20 million during that period, city officials hope environmental groups could chip in the difference if the actual amount falls short of the sales price for Alhambra Hills.

If the measure fails, Richfield says it intends to proceed with development. To those who support the measure, the decision to conserve Alhambra Hills for generations to come is a slam-dunk.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a magical view up there, a stunning ridge,‚Äù said Councilman Mark Ross, who often visited the area as a child. ‚ÄúThe way the forest parts into the open California grassland ‚Äî that‚Äôs really special.‚Äù Ross said if residents approve the tax measure, the city would turn the ridgeline property into ‚Äúthe greatest central park a city could have on the West Coast.‚Äù

The land also holds historical significance because some of it apparently once belonged to Muir, according to Martinez resident Jamie Fox, who leads the Save Alhambra Hills Open Space Committee. Fox, a Google electrical engineer, said he tracked down a U.S. National Park Service map in 2014 that revealed Muir owned property on the ridgeline in the 1800s.

With help from Muir‚Äôs great-grandson, he brought the map to city officials, who hadn‚Äôt known about the history when they oversaw Richfield‚Äôs 300-page environmental impact report years earlier.
‚ÄúThis is not just a city issue,‚Äù Fox said. ‚ÄúThis is a national historic site, and we can‚Äôt let it be destroyed. It‚Äôs too special.‚Äù

Stephen Nussbaum, Richfield‚Äôs director of asset management, said the company in ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù gave the city the time it needs to buy the property. 

‚ÄúIf Measure F fails we intend to proceed with the approved project,‚Äù Nussbaum said in an email, explaining that Richfield has already invested millions of dollars since buying the property.

Richfield has been trying to get the project off the ground since the early 1990s, when it initially won the city‚Äôs approval for a much larger development of 212 homes on 122 acres.

Back then, environmental groups got involved and pointed out the ridgeline serves as a habitat for the threatened Alameda whipsnake. In the face of opposition, Richfield backed off and agreed to downsize the project‚Äôs scale.

Richfield subsequently discovered that building homes on the steep hillside would be much more expensive than anticipated, and a once-stable housing market that turned volatile in
the late 2000s didn‚Äôt help.

By the time Richfield came back in 2011 seeking approval for the downsized development and promising to create a public trail network on the rest of the property, city officials didn‚Äôt
want to see any homes built along the ridgeline.

But city officials felt their hands were tied because the area has been zoned residential since the 1970s and Richfield had already agreed to cut the number of homes by more than half to mitigate potential environmental impacts such as harming the whipsnake.

So the council, with Ross dissenting, approved permits for the 109-home development. Several council members made it clear they did so to avoid a potential lawsuit.

Asked why the council had turned sour on the development after once being for it, Ross said the original approval came ‚Äúwell before the value of pure open space was realized by communities and legislative bodies. Soon, it was, ‚ÄòHey, this (development) is really ugly.‚Äô

I‚Äôm in real estate, it‚Äôs my industry, and I can tell you this is a significant visual detriment to many parts of Martinez.‚Äù

No organized opposition to Measure F has surfaced yet, Ross said. ‚ÄúThe public has come to understand the value of the environment,‚Äù he surmised. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs been a gradual learning curve,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúOpen space is the most obvious, because unlike global warming, you can see the subdivision on this hill forever. It‚Äôs a glaring environmental issue.‚Äù

The Dangers of Food Elitism 
By Jaclyn Krymowski for Protect the Harvest 

Access to adequate food is an extremely important topic. All people deserve to have access to safe and nutritious foods. In today‚Äôs society, there are numerous questions to ask about food, food security and the recent focus on elite foods.  

‚Ä¢ Are various food-focused social justice initiatives really pushing towards the goal of safe, nutritious foods, or are they working to redefine what safe and nutritious means? 
‚Ä¢ Do the groups who are trying to make ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and ‚Äúnutritious‚Äù simultaneous with buzzwords like ‚Äúorganic‚Äù, ‚Äúplant-based‚Äù, and ‚Äúall-natural‚Äù, know what impact their actions have on food equity? 

Food Bullying is a Reality and It Starts with Food Marketers and Their Counterparts, Animal and Environmental Extremists
In her book, Food Bullying, author Michele Payn, points out that people may find themselves selecting certain food products or labels because of how it will make them feel, increase their status, or earn praise from peers. The choices they make aren‚Äôt necessarily derived from nutrition or safety, but from an elitist mindset.

We Support All Forms of Agriculture ‚Äì We Do Not Support Misinforming the Public
There is nothing wrong with providing high quality products to the elite buyer.  We support organic farming and conventional farming.  We also support different types of animal production systems.  What we do not support and believe is morally wrong is the practice of misinforming the public about our food system and the nutritional value of the foods they can afford to provide their families.  

Why Are We Making the Statement that These Groups Are Partners in crime?  
Many of these elite food marketing groups and companies tap into the false narrative established by animal and environmental extremist groups to push their own products.   Elitist marketers and their counterparts, animal and environmental extremist groups, have purposely overlooked and ignored the reality that our modern food systems provide safe, nutritious, humane and most importantly, affordable food.  Through their marketing they repeat the negative disinformation about modern agriculture propagated by animal and environmental extremist groups.   Keep in mind that animal extremists want to end all animal agriculture and view animal ownership as akin to slavery and abuse.   Environmental extremist groups view humankind as a global parasite and they have been pushing this narrative for years.  This provides a convenient, already established narrative that elite food companies and marketers tap into.  Animal and environmental extremist groups are in a sense, saving elite food marketers money since they have already worked to establish a false narrative in which they can use it as a platform to sell their food products.  They use the false narrative designed and marketed by extremist groups to enforce the false notion that vegan and other elite foods are the epitome of good health. 

What is worse is that marketers for elite foods frown upon families who choose products they deem are ‚Äúover-processed"" or ‚Äúunhealthy.‚Äù Not only are these accusations unfounded, but those same families simply don‚Äôt have the money to spend on expensive alternatives. Without affordable animal protein products like eggs, dairy, beef, pork, and poultry, they‚Äôd have no other choice but to go hungry.

Veganism is Elitist and Unhealthy
One of the dangers of the vegan animal extremist ideology is their insistence that their proposed diet is suitable for everyone and entirely ‚Äúnatural.‚Äù  They ignore the facts and put the health of people at risk in favor of their radical ideology.  Animal extremist groups also ignore the stark reality that the animal extremist vegan lifestyle requires some degree of supplementation to meet lacking nutrients found in abundance in animal products like B12, iron and Vitamin D to name a few. Additionally,  vegan meat and dairy substitute products like fake bacon, processed pea patties, fake cheese and juices that are supposed to replace milk, are significantly more expensive compared to wholesome real meat and dairy products.  If those manipulated into following the vegan ideology cannot afford those products they are then only able to afford produce and grain staples.

From a health perspective, vegan diets are not recommended for everyone. Physicians from all over the world have warned against the dangers of vegan diets in children, citing multiple instances of malnutrition and average delayed growth patterns.  In some countries forcing children to eat a vegan diet is considered child abuse and a crime.  

Food Elitism is Not Family Friendly
Unfortunately, years of plentiful eating have blinded a lot of the elite to the fact that so many under-privileged families rely on our affordable and sustainable food system. The trend of companies serving the elite and wealthy have taken advantage of this ignorance in their marketing tactics. 

Most people cannot afford to shop at high-end grocery stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe‚Äôs and types of farmers‚Äô markets. On average, their groceries are about 20% more expensive compared to traditional stores reflecting a privilege of the elite class.

Examples of Nefarious Marketing Tactics Which Mislead the Public
Nefarious food product marketing tactics take many forms.  Many marketing firms and elite food companies use scare tactics to sell their products.  Using false or exaggerated disinformation, their messaging heavily implies that other foods are nutritionally inferior and unsafe compared to certain products that are produced the ‚Äúright‚Äù way. Of course, the ‚Äúright way‚Äù is their way.  Their marketing messaging fully ignores the facts about food safety and the USDA‚Äôs role in ensuring the food items people purchase are safe to consume.  What these marketing tactics don‚Äôt tell people is that conventionally raised meat, eggs and dairy fall under the safest food inspections and regulations in the world. Likewise, they have a very similar nutritional profile to food items which are marketed as  ‚Äúpastured raised‚Äù  or ‚Äúorganic‚Äù. 

These scare tactics can be especially harmful to low-income and underprivileged families who are led to believe that they are not and cannot feed their families properly.

Cooks Venture is an example of elitist marketing and pricing.  They are a food delivery service focused on pasture-raised beef and chicken (they have plans to expand their lineup soon). A 9 to 10-pound box of their assorted beef and chicken cuts goes for $149.99.  By comparison, the average cost per pound of a conventional whole chicken is just $1.70 and beef $4.73.

‚ÄúGood food is vital for health and happiness,‚Äù says their website, heavily implying that their meats are ‚Äògood‚Äô compared to other conventionally raised products. 

The site continues:
‚ÄúDespite the pastoral images and marketing claims, almost all meat today comes from mainstream operations that are labeled with greenwashed buzzwords. Finding food that is good for both us and the planet doesn‚Äôt have to be this hard.‚Äù

While marketing language, this tone is harmful as it reinforces a misconception that is already so rampant among consumers: that products derived from conventional animal agriculture are inferior to niche products sporting labels like ‚Äúgrass-fed‚Äù ‚Äúpasture-raised‚Äù ‚Äúorganic‚Äù or ‚Äúall-natural.‚Äù (Keep in mind that the definitions for some of these are not even officially defined.)

A company with a similar marketing approach is ButcherBox, which says it ‚Äúwas started with the idea that everyone should have access to high-quality, humanely raised meat.‚Äù  But is their $149/month delivered box if 9 to 14 pounds of meat really accessible to everyone?

‚ÄúWe only work with companies and farmers that are dedicated to doing the right thing,‚Äù continues the website, ‚Äúnever cutting corners‚Ä¶‚Äù

This is yet another example of a company which is painting conventional, modern animal agriculture as the enemy.  The goal is to shame the elite into purchasing their products and it fully ignores those who cannot afford the high-end products they are pushing.

Food Insecurity is the Real Issue
Despite being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, Americans still fall into the ‚Äúfood insecure‚Äù category making up about 10.5% of households in 2019, according to data from the Department of Agriculture.  In poorer countries, that number is much higher with some having notable portions of their populations being chronically malnourished.

A pivotal solution to all of this starts, of course, at the farm level. However, the disconnect between large farms, modernization and food equity is unfortunately ongoing. A Global Washington article cites increasing farm efficiency productivity as being necessary to help alleviate the rising cost of food products. This includes ‚Äúa comprehensive approach that includes access to heartier seeds, more effective tools, improved farm management practices, locally relevant knowledge and reliable markets.‚Äù University researchers and livestock veterinarians have dedicated decades to refining modern farming practices to provide humane, sustainable, wholesome, and affordable foods. Large farms, especially those in first-world countries, have embraced the research available to them and implemented modern practices.  Unfortunately, the Global Washington article leaves out the vital role of research and modern farming practices.  Instead, it cites small farms (without defining what that term means) as being part of the solution. 

Diane Sullivan Fights for Food Security
In her testimony before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy on February 6, 2020, food security activist, Diane Sullivan, shared her insight into the real-world implications of food elitism as a mother who has experienced hunger and homelessness.

‚ÄúToo often, food policy debate in this country exclusively takes place among those in power‚Äîelected officials, scholars, researchers, both for-profit and non-profit special interest groups, and more,‚Äù she shared. ‚ÄúRarely are those of us with lived experience in hunger invited to the table when the policies that directly impact our lives are discussed, designed, and implemented. This is increasingly the case as retailers, policymakers, state ballot initiatives, and more press to regulate farmers in such a way that eliminates affordable, safe and nutritious food choices and drives up the cost of our food.‚Äù

Sullivan also commented on the significant role that hardworking farmers and ranchers play in the conventional food system to make food equitable to struggling households. 

‚ÄúMy experience has taught me that productive farmers and ranchers in this country are perhaps among the best friends low-income people could have,‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúThey provide us the broadest choices of safe and affordable food options in the world, so long as they are permitted to do so. As low-income consumers, we remain stuck in the middle of policies that increase the cost of our food‚Ä¶‚Äù

In 2016, Sullivan was the campaign manager for a ballot committee that opposed a ban on sales of meat and eggs from animals raised in large modern farms (Mass Question 3) ‚Äì which is the vast majority of affordable and conventionally raised animal products.

""On so many occasions, I've been in a position where I haven't been able to feed my children an appropriate meal,"" Sullivan shared in an interview for a local publication. ""When my SNAP benefits have run out, my paycheck is still a couple of days away, I've been able to go to the grocery store, gather up a dollar in change, purchase a dozen eggs and feed my children at least a source of protein."" 

She added:
""My passion is driving me. I know what hunger looks and feels like. Who's going to take on an organization like the Humane Society of the United States to defend poor people? Poor people are too often voiceless.""

The Farm Systems Reform Act Will Drive Up the Price of Affordable Food
In addition to recent attacks on affordable food and modern agriculture like Mass Question 3, and California‚Äôs Prop 2, and Prop 12, there are animal extremist influenced politicians continuing to push their ideology while ignoring the impact on American families.  

Considering the average spending of an American family on their monthly grocery bill, and that many are still going hungry, the disruption of the conventional food system ‚Äì particularly animal-derived proteins ‚Äì would be catastrophic. The Farm Systems Reform Act is one of the latest legislative efforts being pushed by vegan extremist, Senator Cory Booker.   This piece of legislation will harm families in the name of food elitism and vegan ideology and it is being done on the national level. 

Animal Extremist Driven State Ballot Initiatives Will Drive up the Price of Affordable Food
In addition to federal legislation, the animal extremist driven state ballot initiatives in Colorado and Oregon  are other new targeted attacks on animal agriculture by animal rights vegan extremists.  They are pushing to eliminate animal protein products from the diets of citizens in those states under a false animal welfare pretense. These initiatives would cripple the states‚Äô animal industries and force an unhealthy diet on growing families by making affordable and nutritious animal protein products prohibitively expensive.

A Balanced Food System
Each year, hundreds of millions of people go hungry around the globe. And, even for those with access to food, many are still deficient in essential vitamins and nutrients. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated over 92% of the population suffers from at least one vitamin or mineral deficiency. At least 10% have a broader type of nutritional deficiency. 

Many of the most common deficiencies found throughout the world can be easily addressed by consuming animal protein products.  Iron deficiency, for example, affects over 25% of the world. A single three-ounce serving of ground beef (one of the most affordable beef products) covers almost 30% of the recommended daily value for iron.

Because vitamin B12 absorption decreases with age, many older adults (an estimated 20% of them) are deficient in this vitamin. Meat, milk and eggs are all abundant, accessible sources.

These are just a few brief examples of vitamins that are essential and found easily in animal products.

Modern Agriculture Provides Affordable, Nutritious and Sustainable Food
Modern agriculture, including livestock production, makes food affordable, is more sustainable, helps to control food byproduct waste, and decreases food disparity among households. Americans today only spend less than 10% of their income on food. For poorer nations (and low-income American households) that percentage is easily 40%, in some cases much more than that. 

Modern, state of the art practices in American agriculture have been developed to feed citizens efficiently and affordably. Everything in our food system ‚Äì from research to farming practices to subsidies ‚Äì all reflect this mindset. Not only are nutritious foods plentiful and accessible, but they also empower consumers with freedom of choice.

The pursuit of an equitable food system should be about offering more, not less, choices to consumers to meet their dietary needs. Restricting them with only expensive alternatives is food elitism that leaves so many vulnerable families to struggle with life‚Äôs most basic necessities.

280,"Sumaiyya ran away from home at age 12. She got sober at 21. Sumaiyya remained sober for 18 years until something terrible happened. What many people do not understand about addiction is people use drugs to escape pain. Sumaiyya ended up homeless in Venice Beach, California. 
.
When Sumaiyya went into A Bridge Home shelter, she didn't talk. Her case manager shared that Sumaiyya is now the life of the party. Sumaiyya's story validates that we can end homelessness when we help people go from the streets to shelter and then permanent supportive housing. It also is a powerful reminder homeless people need housing and support to heal. 
.
With @pathpartners and @vchcorp support, Sumaiyya moved into her own single apartment that provides case management and other services. Joe Kulman from PATH shared in this video fighting my friend Kenneth moving into a similar apartment https://youtu.be/JNA-PoN-aJc, shelters are filled with people ready and waiting to move into housing, but there is no housing. 
.
We can end homelessness. We've known how to end homelessness for years. We just lack the political and public will to end homelessness. Instead, cities continue to invest in criminalizing homelessness over creating the affordable housing and support services needed. That's where you come in. 
.
We all must advocate for more housing and support services and stop homeless sweeps at the local level. At the same time, we must continue to pressure state and federal legislators. Your voice can help end homelessness. If we do not fix the affordable housing crisis, homelessness will continue to get worse.

After receiving training from CRI President Karen England and Greg Burt from CFC, throngs of people headed to legislative offices to express opposition to AB 2223, a bill decriminalizing infanticide. 

Then at 11 AM, thousands gathered at a press conference on the capitol steps led by RI Director Gina Gleason and CFC President Jonathan Keller.  Speakers included:

- Pastor Jack Hibbs (Calvary Chapel Chino Hills and Founder of Real Impact); 

- Pastor Greg Farrington (Destiny Christian Church, Rocklin); 

- Pastor Jim Franklin (Cornerstone Fresno); 

- Kevin Mcgary, (Every Black Life Matters) 

- Pastor Marc Little, (Cure America Action);

443,"Exciting News!

I am thrilled to announce that we have a special film screening happening at Bethel Church, Twin View on April 28th!

We will be watching the award-winning documentary Tending Clouds, which tells the extraordinary story of the victorious overcomer and trafficking survivor, Reaksmey Haas.
When Reaksmey was eight years old, she was sold by her mother to an American pedophile. She was later rescued and brought into the care of Agape International Missions. Despite enduring horrific trauma, she and several other minors dared to testify against their abuser in a historic trial that resulted in a 210-year prison sentence. Now a young adult, Reaksmey has started her own business and is working in Cambodia to free girls from the very bondage she endured. While rebuilding her life, she once again has to testify against her abuser in a retrial during the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Tending Clouds tenderly tells the story of a woman of great courage who refuses to allow tragedy to define her.
We will be joined by Northern California Anti-Trafficking Coalition, Agape International Missions, Justice Collective, and Terina Dutton of Yasha Global Home and One Heart Global. This is a night to gather as a community to discover our part in fighting this evil.
Mark your calendars for April 28th! The film starts at 7:00 and the doors will open shortly beforehand. More details in the coming days! Please invite all your friends!

450,"Here are the top 10 questions our staff has received regarding the OCPA:

1. What is the Orange County Power Authority (OCPA)? 
The OCPA (established in 2020) is an independent, locally governed, not-for-profit Community Choice Energy Provider of electricity for all residential and commercial customers in Irvine, Fullerton, Huntington Beach, Buena Park, and the unincorporated areas of Orange County. 
 
2. Is it true that Irvine taxpayer money is funding the OCPA?
Yes. The former City Council entered into an agreement for the City of Irvine to fund the OCPA through 2022. So far, $7.7 million of Irvine taxpayer money has been advanced to the OCPA.
 
3. Where has the $7.7 million of Irvine taxpayer money gone?
We don't know. The OCPA has not provided the City of Irvine with any detailed financial information regarding purchasing agreements or the hiring of staff, consultants, and lawyers. According to the agency's website, the Power Authority's projected loss for 2022 will be $23 million and $17 million the following year (2023).
 
4. Am I being enrolled in the OCPA without my expressed permission?
Yes. The City of Irvine has joined the OCPA. As a result, all businesses operating in the City of Irvine are being transferred this month from their current provider of electricity, Southern California Edison (SCE) and enrolled in the new OCPA plan. Later this year ‚Äî in October ‚Äî all Irvine residential customers will be transferred from SCE to OCPA.
 
5. Will we pay less for electricity under the OCPA plan?
No. The business and residential plans selected by the City of Irvine are more expensive than SCE. Residential customers will pay as much as 6% more for electricity than they currently pay to SCE. Commercial customers will also pay more ... unless they ""opt-down"" to the 38% renewable rate, which will cost the same as SCE.
 
6. Will we get electricity derived from 100% renewable sources?
No. The electricity you receive from OCPA will remain the same to every household and business. It will be provided to your home through SCE transmission lines. However, the expectation is that the money you pay into OCPA will be used to purchase cleaner energy down the road.
 
7. Has OCPA followed through on its promise to create local sustainable programs?
No, not yet. Although the Power Agency's website states that local sustainable programs will be created, our staff has been unable to find any such programs that have been established in the first two years of the agency's existence.
 
8. Can I stay with SCE?
Yes. Businesses can ""opt-out"" within five days of being transferred out of SCE and enrolled in OCPA by calling 1-866-262-7693. Once residents receive their enrollment notice ‚Äî which is expected to be mailed out sometime in August ‚Äî they will be able to call the same phone number to opt-out of OCPA and remain with SCE.
 
9. Is OCPA installing their own electric power lines?
No. SCE will continue to maintain the grid, repair power lines, and provide Irvine customers one consolidated utility bill that includes OCPA electric generation charges and SCE electric delivery charges.
 
10. What happens if the OCPA fails?
If the OCPA fails, commercial and residential customers will be transferred back to SCE. As far as the $7.7 million of Irvine taxpayer money that has been advanced to the OCPA so far, at the November 9, 2021 Council meeting, the Irvine City Attorney said the City ""will not get repaid.""",Irvine Community News & Views
