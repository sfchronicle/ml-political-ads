seeing around the country is already the groundwork being laid to essentially have a coup so a redistricting frenzy is underway across the country it is map makers and politicians picking their voters rather than the other way around fewer people are aligning with the gop s platform and so in order for them to hold on to power they re going to cheat it wouldn t have to be a violent cool it would be a coup by legislative process music over the past 10 years texas gained about 4 million people in total population 95 of that population was people of color despite people of color fueling the growth over the past decade there were no new majority minority districts drawn in either the state senate the state house or the congressional map and in fact both committees made an effort to reduce the number of majority minority districts on all three levels there was a particular attention to a district just north of austin in a county called bell county that is home to a sizable black population and in this county we had two districts placed within its boundaries that looked like a donut there was the outer ring district and then there was the inner district that basically worked to cut up the population of the two biggest cities within that county basically ensuring that people of color in that county could not elect candidates of their choice some of the worst districts were in the greater houston area and into the houston suburbs and fort bend county in particular congressional district 7 take part of populations in harris county and then also cut up the aapi communities that have grown tremendously there over the past 10 years because of these maps that don t accurately reflect texans and their values we get a legislature that is passing laws that are not favorable with the people of texas and this includes senate bill 8 known as the texas heartbeat law bans almost all abortions in the state the texas bill is unique permitting almost anyone to sue any person or provider who may have helped someone get an abortion after the limit north carolina is really a true 50 50 state roy cooper who s our democratic governor won reelection by 51 the same election where trump won the state really all the statewide elections you see are right down the line we would hopefully expect that our state you know politics that our congressional members would reflect that but but they don t because of because of gerrymandering in the maps that just got passed the communities that are being targeted to dilute their representation are all urban communities they re all the places where communities of color are you know they re taking places like greensboro it s a growing town it s our third largest city has a very large historical black population that city is basically being scooped out of its county and paired with really rural mountain counties that are very far away have very different interests and are demographically very different even if democrats are winning more than 50 percent of the votes they re still ending up in the minority in our state legislature and our state legislature is deciding all these really impactful things i mean we re still one of the few states that hasn t expanded medicaid it s something that the vast majority of north carolinians want it would give health coverage to 500 600 000 people in our state who really really need it there s this just huge mismatch between what the people of the state actually want what they ve actually voted for and what they get georgia has 14 congressional districts and under the map that was passed republicans have between nine and ten of those seats which is really remarkable in a state that is one of the quintessential battlegrounds right now georgia is very much a 50 50 state almost evenly down the line what we saw last decade is the emergence of an increasingly diverse multi racial georgia tech gwinnett county for example which is in the suburbs of atlanta you know in 1990 gwinnett county was 90 white it s only 30 white today and yet that is not at all being recognized in the maps that the georgia legislature passed in the atlanta suburbs michelle al is the first chinese american woman elected to the georgia state senate her district is about 62 percent non white and in redistricting it s transformed to a district that s 52 percent white it goes from being a biden district to a trump district in ohio on the congressional map there are 15 congressional districts republicans are favored to win 12 of those in any given year democrats only three which is wildly skewed in fact you know that s about 80 percent of seats in a state where republicans at most win about 53 percent of the vote music we have reintroduced hr4 the john robert lewis voting rights advancement act hr4 will create a new coverage formula to determine which states have been the most egregious actors and subject them to pre clearance that is based on a current evidence of voter discrimination the freedom to vote act will improve access to the ballot by setting national standards for absentee voting early voting and in person voting this bill will end partisan gerrymandering it s not too late for congress to act but the train is literally leaving the station music you,"black,gerrymandering,abortion,expanded medicaid,discrimination,abortions,values,voting
