and music through the night that our flag was still there oh say does that star spangled applause land of the applause breaks applause we unleash the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than is therefore freedom did the individual have been more available than in any other place on earth for this freedom at times has been high we have never been unwilling to pay that price it does require however our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great to believe that together with god s help we can and will resolve the problems which now confronts we are americans music applause music applause music music good morning good morning hey listen stay stay standing stay standing father we come before you god we ask you to take this day you created it you established it and lord i know that we re a people that have been gathered together who love this country not everywhere in this room are watching we understand that but father we pray right now that the reality of who you are the grandeur of this nation that you gave us and the fact that you re alive gives us ultimate hope we ve talked a lot about this last week regarding in the things that are valuable to us and we must admit that these things that we hold dear are things that you have always been righteous freedom liberty love kindness forgiveness grace mercy salvation father we give you this time and we ask it in jesus name and all god s people said amen now you can be seated god bless you guys it s great to see you good to see you you guys want to shout on the count of three it s merry christmas right they re already starting it over here i want to hear it loud we re not going to let the culture rob us of shouting christmas right one two three merry christmas charlie brown for sure amazing so we look at our nation and all that s going on around us and we must re i m hearing all week the fact that this nation has been founded in a way that no other country on earth can boast obviously there s the correlation with the united states and israel you open up the bible and you see that god called israel out of slavery that he established them upon his word the bible and that all the way through whenever god wanted to bring his people back he brought them back to the bible back to the word of god we saw in the days of nehemiah when israel had been taken captive that they returned to the word we saw that with ezra they returned to the word every time we see a reawakening it s the returning to the word of god friends listen i know that there may be somebody who will say i love this country but not not the god that you talk about and that s okay i want you to hear something the god that i rep today is the god that the bible says is all creator and that the bible says he is love that he is grace that he has forgiveness but that he is holy and this is why what you and i are standing for matters now look i m a pastor so i m i m i m allowed to say what i m about to say woke pastors need to either change their biblical world view or go look for another job up or you need to get out by all means we need to get back to the bible back to the word of god again and you say well what makes you say that this nation s history makes listen when we talk about our founding fathers we need to understand that when we read our founding father to talk about their founding fathers did you know that listen adams jefferson washington talked about the founding fathers you say jack wait a minute i thought those guardian fathers they are our founding fathers but when they were beginning this nation they leaned back upon the pilgrim experience look just a couple weeks ago we celebrated thanksgiving did you realize that in 2021 we celebrated the 400th thanksgiving service that had been conducted in america 400 years ago 400 years ago and this is what s awesome this is what s glorious about it that when the mayflower pulled up before they got off that ship william bradford in the gang half of them believers half of them not they said we re not getting off this ship until we have a governing body of laws and they crafted what is called the mayflower compact now if i was the dictator of education in america nobody would from school unless they had memorized the mayflower compact very big it s not very difficult but i can tell you right there for those who are saying america is not founded upon god man you need to read some history and oh by the way i don t know if it was tucker if it was i know charlie but listen this whole thing about the 1619 project you gotta listen that is so dumb it is so dumb because why stop at 16 19 why don t you go back to 1605 when reverend hunt came to this country to this continent and preached the gospel when he landed in what was parts of virginia or would be virginia 1605 ladies and gentlemen host 16 19 16 19 that was a focus on a bunch of people who came here for prisons and not for god reason most of it failed until you get to the 1620 landing of the pilgrims and why did they succeed everybody you need to know this i think you do i m just saying it anyway in 1620 is when they came because it was rooted in faith it wasn t rooted in anything else and how do you know that the mayflower says this it says right there that we have come in the name of our king and our god to this continent to spread the gospel of jesus christ it s in the mayflower compact and to back that up everybody in plymouth massachusetts there is a massive pillar and that pillar which nobody rarely ever stops to see is the founders monument and it s all a way around label by the characteristics and attributes of what makes a great nation and this is what they believed they believe that this is what makes a great that you re educated from education dispels barbarous acts if you re educated that you should be merciful to one another that you should love each other because with that you can establish a country based upon laws that there s there s a god in heaven that we live and conduct our lives understanding that he s holy and we re not that that is to be that god s word would be the guiding light you just heard that tape played again that audio bugging again and you know everybody says oh reagan said that this we need to make this nation city on the shining hill listen john winthrop said that reagan knew that and reagan quoted john winthrop who was the first governor of the pilgrim colony founded upon the word of god now look you don t have to become a follower of this country that s how amazing our founders were they knew the lord but what they did is that they created a nation where even the atheists would have the freedom to exercise their atheism that s how much freedom we ve got it s amazing but we look around and listen everybody it s been referenced look i m i m it s the last day i don t have much to say you guys have already heard it all and i m telling you though right now that what we ve been hearing it will be a crime if we leave this facility and we do not determine to put into practice what we ve been learning this week we have got to do it charlie mentioned on the opening day charlie mentioned something that i wonder if you got it and believe it or not it was probably one of the most powerful things said he said you need to run for school board you need to run for pta you need to know how much power you can have in those entities because like many have said politics is local oh and one word about politics so aren t you a pastor you shouldn t talk about politics let me put it to you this way the bible says that god invented government in the book of leviticus he invented government it s repeated in the book of exodus throughout the bible god is the given you know what happens to government when man takes control of it without seeking god he makes it into politics man makes the politics god has established the government government is where you and i have enjoyed for 400 years and that we had the freedom to worship we had the freedom and the prosperity and the education to not only be blessing one another but to bless the entire world ladies and gentlemen we all if you live in arizona i live in southern california obviously a border state listen here s the deal i was down at the border with federal agents and i asked an agent how many people do you have to deal with that are breaking into he said you mean california and i said no how many people do you have to deal with that are breaking into mexico from california and he said man i don t understand your question he said oh i get i get it nobody breaking into mexico from california this country is still the greatest hope on earth as messed up as it is it s still the greatest home people are breaking into this country because hope is what the bible talks about listen king david when he saw that his nation was falling apart in psalm 11 he cried out and he said you were asking me to fountain of the lord he said what am i to do and what shall the righteous do when the foundations are removed our nation s foundations have been shaken by those who do not believe in our constitution they do not believe in the god of the bible they do not believe in individual responsibilities or freedoms and they ve imposed make no mistake about it they have imposed their deity upon us their deity is tyranny their deity is made up of a bunch of little demigods that they call the shots a handful of those who are the power brokers and i want you to know something jesus called that nicolaitans if you re familiar with your bible just the works of the nicolaitans which i hate jesus said that and the word nicolaitans means those that lord over the people god wants you to connect with him personally god wants this nation there s still hope for this nation to turn back and listen i gotta tell you i love our military i love this nation from a marine uh i gotta tell you uh i fight for this country right now i m old but i m gonna go down swinging but i gotta tell you this everybody i got to tell you this it s the the strength is not in the military the strength is not in the white house the strength is not in the state house the strength is in god when we we see god he will respond and let s all let s all agree right now that we re in a desperate moment of time this is the first time in human history that what s going on in the world is happening to the world at the exact same time we need to wake up and realize something s up didn t tucker say it the other day when yes he said it s spiritual he hit the nail on the head you guys know uh j r r tolkien author of lord of the rings how did the lord of the rings come about in token s mind tolkien saw world war one and tolkien being a soldier said to himself there is no way this can be happening warring with man there s got to be demon invisible forces that are behind man killing man and he invented he gave us the lord of the rings i got news for you tucker was exactly right the issue is spiritual but i m gonna differ with tucker and i i don t know him i hope he s not here uh don t tell him i said this but uh look i m sure you love montana like everybody else loves montana but uh he he was encouraging you to go build a cabin somewhere i m i m inviting you to move to california and put on your battle gear you need to come come fight we don t go listen don t don t run to some place go get us if you want fine come and that s what charlie s all about listen i know that i m old enough to be charlie s dad but i got to tell you i pray for the strength of charlie kirk to be a clear joy and hip on making then knowledgeable his freedoms are and that god in heaven his freedoms and you guys check this out i got a few moments left so david looked around and he said what is the righteous to do when the foundations are removed our foundations are being removed we re being attacked what do we do you do the same thing that david did and that all have done from the ages when everything looks impossible you turn and you look up and you say god look down from heaven and have mercy god have mercy upon us listen friends our nation california specifically now has sanctioned abortion our governor is saying i fear the overturn of roe v wade and so i sense that that s coming this is newsome he senses that the roe v wade ruling is going to be overturned that abortion is going to be abolished so he s doubling down and he is announcing to america that california will be your abortion destination state applause guess what we re doing dear god in heaven either save gavin newsom or give us a new governor but by all means please don t let that happen applause when the foundations are shaken maybe in life your foundations have been shaken i thank god for listen i know it sounds crazy man but i thank god for there s a lot of people in california that have not bowed the need to fouchy i mean and not bowed the need to fear applause we understand it s flu season happens every year here s the deal when we are told by politics not government you can t gather you can t sing out loud isn t it funny you can t sing out loud you can t you can t gather together listen the more i read my bible and read my bible the more i understood if that s what i m hearing from politics then it s time to obey god rather than man it s time for us to do the right thing and so for us today your life there s no doubt in a room this size that you ve lost someone this last year it s it s possible you ve known somebody who died from covid cancer heart attacks old age we all have but what about you the moment we hear about death isn t it a faith isn t amazing everybody s afraid of death all of a sudden in the whole world you re not allowed to get sick nobody s allowed to die wear a mask wrap yourself in bubble wrap and stay home you can t get sick why because you could die well we re all going to die the point is to the gospel is that for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever him would not perish but have everlasting life listen we re all we re all gonna we re all going to die we re all going to die here s the deal you got to get ready before you die jesus said if somebody dies believe even forever jesus said i am the way the truth and the life and no man comes to the father but through me isn t that narrow yeah that s so narrow you bet it s narrow son died once on the cross never to die there again to make a way of salvation for you it s free it cost them everything but it s free to you so the number one thing about turning back america is that we get on our knees that s how we fight do we run for office absolutely do we vote knowing the candidates absolutely always look at their voting records never listen to them listen never listen to candidates when they don t listen to them voting records their voting records never lie they ll lie through their teeth but the voting record never lies so you you vote smart you pray you get involved because here s here s what you do at the end of the day for one you make sure that when all this is over someday it s all going to be done going to come to the end of your life or the end of your moment and you re going to want to make sure that jesus christ is the lord of your life wisdom you being a good person ain t gonna cut it if you could be good enough to get to heaven then why did jesus die on the cross listen he he died for jerks like me he died for sinners like me it s him and listen you want your soul secure because you rise from that and you go forward doing the right thing well you guys in california you just had a the largest recall in american history against your governor that s right but you wound up losing listen it was the biggest recall in american history it was awesome here s the deal would we like to have won yes but here s the deal we stood for what s right and at the end of time we get to look god in the face and say we did what s right and listen i i invite you to say yes to jesus christ our only hope he s enough he s all that you need and when the foundations are shaken he ll stand strong god bless you guys applause music how s everybody doing it is a great time to be an american i m corey deangelis i m from the american federation for children and it s also a great time to be a school choice advocate the teachers unions have finally overplayed their hand showed their true colors and in

you can describe it hello america fest this is jack posobik once again the host of human events on the turning point live network now one of the main questions that i get every day is jack how do i

message for this you text get involved all one word to seven seventeen seventy six all one word to seven seventeen seventy six and a member of our team will reach out to a i ll see you out there we should fund students directly not the system anybody heard of the the national association i mean before this year it s like no one really knew what it was it s like why does the national school board association even exist in the first place but it turns out that there s been pushback here too on the part of parents it it s a good idea to label parents as domestic terrorists for pushing back at the school board meetings and since they put out that statement to the biden administration essentially labeling and suggesting that some parents should be labeled as domestic terrorists 18 states have already voted to defund the national school board association parents are taking their power back and it can happen at the state and local level we re seeing that with the national school board association i mean at this point can we even call it the national school board association 18 states have already left they ve lost already over 42 percent of their state level funding maybe we ll call it the regional school board association or something at this point because at this point uh people are understanding that it doesn t make any sense so let s continue join us in the fight to fund students not systems you can go to the educationfreedompledge com or for short if you want to go to ed edfreedompledge com help us join the fight to fund students not systems at the american federation for children thank you guys so much have fun applause music america is the greatest country that we have ever seen i was able to receive information and realize that we do not live in a racist country i get so sick and tired of being sick of these idiotic people you should have an ounce of respect for anybody claiming black lives matter at this point when they don t give a flying fear about black police officers they don t care about black conservatives see a lot of you and tell you what you want to hear and then you ll buy it and switch it up that s the problem applause music applause music applause music all right y all need to stay standing because y all know how i get you get you get your blood flowing and let me tell you why i do this every time i speak people say why do you want us to stand and do the little chant it s because i believe in the bible and i believe that the power of life and death is in your tongue in the beginning god said like we are made in god s image and likeness we have power in the things that we say all right so don t bash the family on tv and let s get this right i want you to yell i win when i point at you and won t you say it like you

million dollars to you for free today one key to success the only thing that you need to know in order to accomplish the dreams that you have to be the person that god has made you to be is to put god first in everything you do put god first in everything you do everything that i have accomplished who i am who some of you believe that i am i ve seen a lot of you some of you had tears in your eyes saying you changed my life all of that is because i put god first all that you will achieve in life all of your aspirations and dreams that thing that s sitting right there in your heart telling you to go for it before all odds tell me you stop worry about what your parents say about you and you go for it some of y all a question of whether or not you should drop out of school and pursue your passion maybe that s you the thing that s burning on the inside some of y all need to go back to school some of you need to pursue your dreams in school some of you guys may want to start a youtube channel like beat tatum but before you do any of that make sure you have god first now i believe that my life is a testimony to the things that i say i wasn t always like this and i say this a lot of times when i speak people don t recognize me wouldn t recognize me if they knew who i was before this i had a badass if you say the wrong thing to me we ll fight i had you i got a young savage tattooed across my stomach if my six pack game was was all right on point i ll show y all but my my wife the meals and then you know hey i want y all to see that side of me but i still have gold teeth in my mouth i got my hood tattooed on my forearm and it took god to revolutionize who i was and changed me in 2008 when i got saved how many people here say i was racist i was racist now i look back on it we used to have a disdain when i was growing up for white people we thought white people hated us and that i had to work four five or six times harder than the white man to achieve i used to believe that police officers were racist white people that just pulled over black people for no reason i used to believe that crowd i used to believe all of it passionate about the things i say today is because i used to be that guy i used to be that person and when i make these videos i m quit being lazy quit making excuses you can be anything you want to be in this country if you work hard and they tell this big lie about our country and our founding i believe that the constitution was inspired through these men by god the problem was and it s just like the bible today is whether or not we applaud the things that were written people say the constitution ain t for the black man constitution we re in the constitution where say white whites only i see nowhere in the pledge of allegiance where it says whites only it don t exist the only problem we struggle with in our country i think we struggle within our faith sometimes is actually applying what was written he didn t want to take he didn t want to take away the constitution united states of america he didn t want to eradicate it he didn t want to get rid of it he wanted us to live up to it live up to the promises that we made don t let these folks lie to you there s no division amongst us we re all one we re all the children of god don t let them lie to you we ve been working together since the very beginning we ve been working together since the very beginning what do you think harriet tubman was doing she was going to lala land having these black people go with her to lala land it s a mysterious place no there were white people who work with her rich their lives so that black people could be free when the vote to free black people in this country of slavery give them citizenship and the right to have a vote those things were voted on by white people i don t know how they missed that we didn t have a right to vote how we gonna vote on our right to vote but there were good white people and they won t they don t want you to believe it there were good white people who never believed that anybody should be a slave they understood the purpose that we had in our country another myth that eats me alive sometimes is the myth that police officers and the police department around the country systemically racist it s a lie it is a lie i was a police officer of arizona in tucson we have any tucsonians in here y all represent for a little town i see you but i was a police officer in tucson never met a racist cop not one time i met some lazy ones i met some ugly ones but i never met a racist cop all the men and women that i went to the briefing and debriefing with we loved one another we would die for one another and it wasn t just words it s not just words that s the problem today people just talk it s lip service we literally went out every day and put our lives on the line for one another in real life and i had one guy be racist towards me he i went on a call he was a he s a say he s a white supremacist he couldn t whoop me if we had a fight so i don t know what his white supremacy would do for him but uh i go to the co says i don t want a black man taking my case report before i could even open my mouth my partner got on his real fast real fast i thought i was gonna have to break him up i thought he was gonna fight the guy that to me tells me that the majority of us will never accept hatred and racism does it exist in america yeah some fools in a cornfield somewhere run around in circles that s probably the extent of racism in america to me in my opinion it has no power and let me tell you this it s a phrase that i use um i made a shirt with a with a title on it because i believe it s an invaluable concept i don t believe in white privilege i believe in christ s privilege why do you say that mr tatum because they re in a single racist white man system whatever you want to call it that can stop what god is already playing in your life it doesn t matter what color you are police officers interact with about 300 million people a year and only a thousand result in the death of somebody you could do the math i m not a mathematician hundred million and one thousand that s some that s some numbers i can t even calculate the computer may put an e on it right the same as covet i didn t say it i didn t say it youtube don t blame me so but it s a myth that they re out here just killing black men and they re out here just thugging it s not true i was on the swat team you you rarely get into a deadly force situation as a police officer i know police i was good at a whole career anybody how have i had to put my gun on people yes have i had to put the hands on people yes have i had to chase people i caught everybody except one guy one dude only reason i didn t catch him i had my rifle in my hand he had some skinny jeans on he was gone i was like yeah damn hope nobody got this on camera but anyway the message today is for you to be inspired you guys said i mean this is the coldest event that i ve ever been to y all agree charlie kirk man he younger than me and he doing it big greatest event i love coming to because i see america at these events i see people of all races all backgrounds all ages all dispositions whatever you name it i see them and we are all together these people who hate us these lunatics on the left hey cause they don t have happiness they can t do anything like this because the first black man show up on their event gonna be crying about oppression and slavery and a thousand years ago black men would stop all that crap stop all that crap you guys should be empowered to do great being inspired have some passion about what you do in life i don t care what your background is i didn t come from a perfect background my parents weren t perfect my life story wasn t perfect i got kicked out of school when i was a senior trying to fight a teacher i threw a chair she was she messed up that time i got arrested when i was eight years old smoking marijuana in a vacant house with my cousins my life i did a whole bunch of stuff i regret but that don t stop you from taking advantage of the 24 hours and i hope that when you leave here you leave here a different person than the person you came here as i hope that you ve been meeting people you ve been connecting with people that live in your state outside of your state people you would normally talk to i m hoping that you re connecting because when you go back wherever you go to school wherever you live that s infiltrated with these brain dead that you have a friend to reach out to that you ve met a new friend to replace these fake people i want you to understand this and i know a lot of y all have lost friends quote unquote y all have lost family members screw them right if if they are not paying your bills if they don t put food on your table if they not taking your tests for you which i hope they not they re already excluded because they can t but if they re not doing those things for you what do you need them for let them go on and cry in the corner find some new friends everybody that i went to school with just about when i came out and i said i supported trump i ll tell you where you can get it at the end of the speech all right hey it s capitalism all right it s capitalism music applause i lost i lost all of my childhood buddies they called

on this stage it ain t just about me i can sit at the house and do these videos my videos get ten thousand twenty thousand thousand views it s because it s about you i want god to use me to help you and god is calling you to use what you heard here to help other people right don t remember nothing else i said when times get tough things go astray remember it s not about you the things that happen to you and i go back in history the things that happen to the slaves people don t want to say this but be tatum keep it real the things that happened to the slaves in this country were for me they went through so i could have life and so black people can have life here in america and it was a tough road but god threw them an opportunity we should be grateful for that s all i got to say we should be grateful i m glad i live in america i hate they have to go through it but i m glad i live in america i hate that christ had to die on the cross but i m glad that i m saved i m gonna start preaching where where the offering pray that pass the offering around it ain t about you when i get discouraged and i say man i m tired of this boy i m tired of people on social media any people that follow me sometimes i ll be wanting to turn it all off and i say it ain t about me how am i gonna get so worked up how am i gonna get so emotional about my friends when jesus died it wasn t a figurative death it wasn t an illusion he got beat he took it and he wasn t even wrong he didn t do nothing wrong he was telling the truth just like y all telling the truth and they didn t want to hear it just like they don t want to hear it but you know what he said i don t care 30 years old he had a long life he said it s time for me to take this punishment for everybody else every time they hit him have you ever got a whooping before raise your hand you got a whoopin oh it was way worse than that whoopi y all got my see my daddy should stay right here when he with me they were whipping

so give it a hand for chad right again we ve got a ranger right here rangers lead the way right actually we have two of them we ve got ryan collector he s an author ranger a sniper and uh the list could go on and on but thank you for being here with us today and then if you don t know john down at the end also a ranger and uh a true america a chance talking a little bit yesterday an honor to have him as well um we re going to jump into this conversation because you don t want to hear from me we re going to we re going to hear from these guys one thing we re dealing with in law enforcement and i know that this is probably the case in the military as well we re seeing a rise of these guys probably don t know the term woke ism or woke because they live in a whole different warrior world than we do uh but we re seeing that liberal woke ism out in them across this country i wanted to ask you guys i ll start with you john because i know you ve got some opinions on this what does how is that liberal wokism affecting the military and the people coming into the military the ranks of the military a great question it s devastating in numerous ways one is i think it steals the hearts of soldiers i mean a soldier is supposed to be ready to die in defense of their country but if if pervasive woken this ideology convinces them that our country is evil that we re all white supremacists xenophobic land stealing fascists why in the world in that you know i i it really if you re defending entry that makes you evil and so why in the world would the soldier die end of country and so it literally erodes the whole foundation of what a soldier is supposed to do we can t survive that third thing that uh this leftism does to the military uh is it s just gonna get people killed is we shameful retreat from afghanistan and it literally i know yeah and it s literally cost the lives of innocent people that some of those americans some of them innocent suffering under uh tyrannical terrorism it s costing people s lives and it s also a signal the rest of the world that america is weak and vulnerable you surely you guys have been gearing up in russia arena gearing up they re not playing woke gender games they re getting ready to take over and dominate and that should alarm this is going to literally get people killed it already is uh and the third thing is what this wokeism is doing is it s eviscerating with the mass evacuation of the special operations community that s our community we re former special operations soldiers all of us uh and here s the fact for you i know a grand total of zero operations guys zero don t exist and and it s to be in that community that we re connected to requires a certain level of down to earth realism also a certain amount of intelligence uh pragmatism uh and uh resilience to bullying you can t believe and so when this left this comes out it s simple it s kind of like and then they just get out i ve gotten so many resumes from seals and rangers and special forces guys that want to come work with the warrior poet society doing training or doing some of our content i get resumes all the time because they refuse to ideology and they re getting run out of the military that s what s happening i was so busy trying to get chad s intro right i forgot about the warrior post society so uh ryan do you have anything to add to that well i agree with john i the reason we was not because we were it was because we believed in something we repeatedly volunteered we volunteered for the military in the first place then you volunteer for maybe various schools or various unit assignments and there s something to be said for why we did that it s because we believed in the country we believed in the flag i mean i still do i don t mean to make it sound that way but there was a never the magic that i felt when i was saluting the flag and knowing just that the swelling of pride i had within me and when you re overseas when you re deployed i deployed a couple times to afghanistan about your time 2001 i was in afghanistan right there s something to be said about that girl back home for the soldier there s something we said about that family back home that you know you re protecting you re there for and when we tell these guys and women that what they re fighting for isn t worth fighting for what do we think great point chad yeah great point guys let me add just something on to that these woke agendas are actually available in the circles of special operations communities let me tell you what we used to do with vaccines when i was a seal operator we d walk into the medical office do you want this vaccine we said yes or no if we said no trash can and we d sign the paperwork this crap is freaking laughable to me man that s how we look man come on and let me tell you what china russia iran they can do whatever they want because i am still convinced that we the people of america have the strongest most dedicated most capable most highly trained operators on the face of the freaking earth man so tell them to bring it son they got nothing on us bring it look that s where we re at let me tell you the problem with these agendas when you re in combat you gotta deal deal with problems within the boundaries of reality you have to accept reality in combat you have to accept the situation for what it is man and let me tell you when you ask me to say that a man can be a woman or now all this crap when you ask me to do that you know what you re asking me to do you re asking me to partake in an alternate reality you re that s what you re doing you re asking me to partake in an alternate reality that is is is not possible in terms of human biology or the laws of nature negative there is an all out war on your perspective of reality and we have a large percentage of our population that are living in an alternate reality if you can convince me to say that people of the same sex can produce a child what else can you convince me to say you can convince me to say whatever you wanted me to say it s about reality man we have to return to reality what is real what is real send it son yeah buddy yeah that s what i m talking about i love it we asked back there if we could do a mic drop we had to catch it if we drop it but that was a bike drop and you know what on top of backwoods navy seal uh wizard hermit reverend chad right right that was fired up man i love my country man i love it too and you know love you guys chad brings up a good point what is our resolve as americans to fight for what we love which is the freedom that we that these men have fought whose friends have died for freedom we have and uh it s an honor to listen to these guys the passion they have for america should be the passion that you leave this this conference with a renewed passion um i just wanted to say one quick thing on bad you know because i want to get into leadership but one thing i saw was them leaving afghanistan you may not think it has an effect here in america but i m going to tell you as a sheriff who deals with border security every day when we sent the message to the world that we were too weak hold our in afghanistan who do you think is gonna that s not gonna stop them from coming to this country illegally especially those who would wish harm on our country now what we talk have been saying that the good men and women of law enforcement and they probably won t raise their hand because cops never do but i know out here we got some cops here today thank you guys and i always say the cops are not the ones that didn t hold the line the police officers out there on the streets are holding the line who didn t hold the line the administrators of this profession there s a lack of leadership in this country of people with the fortitude to stand up for what is right and to stand up for the minute when he put on the badge so i want to talk to you about leadership in the military we talked a little bit about the woke ism and i want to talk we ll start with uh ryan this time what is the leadership and how do you see this being an issue in the military well i think i see where some of the problem is coming from when we have leaders like general miley and people like this that are advancing this woke culture agreed they re the ones that are leading the charge on this wokeness in the military that needs to stop and i think the reason is where they come from i mean i ve gone to college since so don t hate me but when i was in the military i was enlisted i didn t go to college first to be an officer you have to go to college and these officers that are in charge are sometimes going to these liberal institutions and they re learning this liberal ideology through college and the more advanced degrees they have arguably the more liberal college they go to sometimes they re promoted better in the military so we have liberals figured it out they beat us to it 30 40 years ago by getting into the colleges first and so when you have general miley there he has the minds at college he doesn t have the mindset starting from being up in the field like us and until we get leaders out there that know what it s actually like to be on the ground i know it s like to be one of the the bottom guys first i don t know if we re going to fix it thank you thank you excellent reverend hold up just a minute let s quit calling these things liberal ideologies and let s start calling them what they are it s freaking evil man evil is the problem there s this weird thing on earth it s this intangible force that we can t see but it s there whether you know it or not and i m gonna go ahead and tell you men like us have seen it and it is called evil right all right and that s what it is it s not a liberal ideology we have to change the way we re talking about these things all right there you can t negotiate with evil evil ain t gonna listen to you you can t make terms with evil you know what you have to do with evil you have to freaking drive it back into the shadows that s what you do with evil screw these people man applause amen battle a good john uh so love what my brother s up here saying but can i get one big round of applause for chad s legs you guys see these things stand up again one more time look at it turn around turn around it s the only sexy thing on my body i i don t know about you guys but i like love what chad s saying i hear about 95 but the other five percent of me is just looking at his legs and just being like thank you john bro bro you knew we were speaking today too you re just kind of like i m gonna wear these shorts i m surprised you can t see him dropping out the shorts oh we re getting way off topic now we gotta reel this hey it s like sad let s back on leadership he said you can t just not say something about that you know very good uh returning to leadership listen the way the world works it just rises and falls on leadership that s just the way it is chad mentioned he believes that the united states has the most elite fighting force that breathes freedom and is ready to lead him and die defending her and i believe that s true i believe that is uh the common soldier i believe that s true with law enforcement as well the good cops out there that s absolutely true uh though i i maintain that s true the weak leader would make it to no real advantage uh and so we have to make sure we have strong leadership uh alexander the great if you don t know him he took over the world by 33 years old quite impressive so he knows something about fighting and he certainly knew something about leadership something amazing about leadership and he said this he said he didn t fear an army of lions by a sheep uh but he did fear an army of sheep led by a lion music let that sink in we cannot survive being led by sheep we can t do it we have to have strong leadership and we the american people soldiers military soldiers cops we have to demand strong leadership and if we don t get it we must get them out we have to we cannot survive weak leadership what the house or whether it s in the top ranks of our military we cannot survive it and we cannot change it until we demand better because we do deserve it and freedom necessitates it excellent excellent and you know this year is our opportunity this is our opportunity to send a rebuking and send real leaders who want to represent america first and i think that s important um we got a lot of folks out here some may have served in the may be active some may be law enforcement how can these people i m gonna start with you chad give them some principles that they can implement that will bring out that america that warrior within agency with inside each and every one of them today oh are y all ready for this son do you guys really want to be warriors do you want to do what warriors do your little story you guys have been hanging out in this conference for the last week and you ve got all this motivation and you ve got all these tools all these ideas and you ve got all these things in your head right that you know need to happen in the seal teams i was a preacher and as a breacher it was my job to build a bomb so that i could blow a hole in the target building so that my team could get in and crush our enemy and every time we would get a target package come down i would go back into the ready room and i would build a bomb and i can t tell you how many hundreds of times i can remember walking up to the target building i was the first person in the patrol and i would take this bomb out of my pack and i would peel the hydrogel off of off the back of it and i would stick it to the wall and i would cap my blasting caps in and i would pay my debt core back to minimum safe distance right and i would look behind me and guess what i would see behind me i would see a bunch of sets of green eyes because it was dark outside and we owned the night i d see a bunch of sets of green eyes and it was my team that was lined up behind me and they were waiting for me to hear three words and you want a tip you want to know what warriors do best you know what you want to know what you need to do when you leave here you need to be thinking about these three words i was waiting for on every target i ever went on as a breacher standing by with my entire team behind me those three words are execute execute execute and that is what warriors do warriors execute execute execute and if you let this knowledge if you let this motivation if you let these ideas die and you don t execute execute execute guess what you re not just cheating yourself you re being selfish and you re cheating your entire nation and you re in cheat you re cheating generations that will follow you generations that are following you are waiting for you to execute execute execute just like every single warrior does on the battlefield and that s what you all need to do when you leave here when you wake up tomorrow morning there needs to be three things going through your head as a matter of fact go ahead and put it in your alarm on your phone so that when that thing goes off in the morning you the phone and your phone tells you to execute execute execute amen brother that s what warriors do that s what sets us apart you don t need no vaccine we just need a little bit of chad s blood in each and every one of us right we ll be all we america be just fine chad i want that as a ringtone will you i will buy that on the app store execute actually my last goes off it s your voice just screaming execute at me i love it brother gotta do it it s the essential ingredient it is the essential ingredient and that is why we are failing right now it s because people won t freaking execute man we got apathetic we got too lazy and now it s time to execute to work john party give us some give us some advice give these guys some warrior advice i m sorry you got to follow chad but i don t understand phrased the question again he just looked at me so i got it we got we got a room full of good americans here yeah how do they implement a warrior lifestyle every day how do they how do they tap into that each and every one of them uh it s been said that a great author love him names g k chesterton he says the soldier doesn t fight because uh he hates what s in front of him it s because he loves what s behind him i think that s so critical and so where i i want to echo yes execute execute execute i think the thing that grounds me to be fearless because that s that s what keeps us from executing right it s fear or or we just don t know what in the world to do right but a lot of times it s fear that paralyzes us uh we don t have one have that awkward conversation or what if i put myself out there and there s consequences and i lose my job or i lose friends or it s an awkward family uh meal or something like that or just debilitated by fear but when i think about the people that i love when i think about the ideals that mean the most to me the things that are worth living for and dying for and that s god that s family that that s country that s everything we stand for when i think about that stuff uh jesus says um perfect love casts out all fear well he said first john uh perfect love casts out all fear um that that s the thing that moves us right and so when i m motivated by love and when i m thinking about those high ideals that s the i think that s the way that we stoke up that courage to master uh that fear and so my encouragement to you guys is this don t let fear steal your life anymore you re good people you re good people god love you for it way to go but part of that means well we re kind of okay to just not make a scene and and be real respectful while the left just wreaks absolute chaos like petulant children screaming picketing whining until they get their way and we re just kind of seeding the field it s kind of like i don t want to i don t want to compete with crazy i m like no we can t afford to give an inch more ground you got to go on the offense you got to have those hard conversations you can t let fear paralyze you anymore and though uh you re not flipping down nods and kicking in doors and blowing uh blowing uh buildings apart like we used to do you are still engaging in the war of ideas and right now we re not in a civil war that we re trying to kill countrymen god forbid we ever get to that please please god protect us from that horrible horrible state but as it is now we re in the war of ideas and you ve got to go on the offense it s not just us we re not going to be able to do it for you it s every person in this room going on the offense in the war of ideas we still be loving we still be respectful but we call a spade a spade and when someone issues this leftist garbage horse crap you re willing to immediately say that is horse crap absolutely not i do not believe in that music thank you john and i want to say john beautiful beautiful point i want to add to that that offense starts with your family and your local community that is where that starts so if you don t have the capacity to run for some congress man or woman or president or whatever it starts in your family and in your local community okay family is the smallest form of government so everyone in here can make a difference everyone in here can execute everyone in here can do what john just encourage you to do don t feel like you re you re out of that you like you don t have the capacity to serve in that manner all right i just think family unity is one of the strengths of america ryan we re running give you a little bit of time but i want to leave save 30 seconds for these guys too to let these folks know where they can follow them what you want your your websites podcasts all that so i would say take care of yourself first before you take care of others it might sound selfish but i mean like the gas mask on an airplane you got to be around and you got to be alive you have to be educated before you can mentor others spiritually go to mentally educate yourself what the topics are take yourself physically you don t have to run for 38 hours straight like chad does but you study in shape right and i ask you to consider moving and taking action before you know exactly what you re doing you can t steer a parked car it has to be moving before you can make some direction right i like to look at life in anything that i ve done anything i ve done that s worked out i started and people ask me how i did it later i i figured it out as i went i look at life like going through hills and valleys out in the woods i m out there at a map maybe or i m navigating i m trying to figure out the way to go well sometimes i m down at the bottom between the mountains and all i see is the trees around me and i can t see the peaks the hills very well and i don t know where to go well sometimes the best way to know where to go is to get up on that hilltop so that takes effort that takes moving that takes walking even though i don t know it s the right and that sometimes in life when i m up on those hilltops and i can look back and i can see where i came and i can see where i m going for me to remember what that terrain looked like because pretty soon i m going to back down again and not see anymore but i got to keep on charging and just move now figure it out as you go later amen move move all right ryan tell them tell everybody where they can find you where they can find your book and then just give me one sentence to sum up what america means to you oh my goodness that s a tough one yeah i might go after john good luck last sentence i have no idea what i m going to say you got to do this in like 20 seconds all right you can find me at gun university com i do myriad projects online with guns and i do them with john i write books i write the long range shooting handbook and stuff like that but university dot com is where it s at go find everything thank you chad where can they find you tell me what i m married yeah guys 37 project dot com the most important thing i can tell you before you leave here today is read your freaking bible and give your heart to jesus that s what drives second timothy 1 7 for god hath not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen brother yeah we re all christians up here isn t that great praise god that s fantastic i ll echo uh that as well uh john lovell warrior poet society we live for higher purpose we re ready to sacrifice in the defense of others that s what warrior poet is and if you if that resonates with you follow warrior poet society

organization that is leading the fight leading the charge against the woke social justice left that is trying to take over our country so what do you do if you want to get involved we actually have set up text message for this you text get involved all one word to 7 1776 get involved all one word 7 1776 and a member of our team will reach out to a i ll see you out there these people need to learn to fear us because we the people are the ones who hold us in power the incompetence of the bible white house cost american lives mr president listen carefully and i ll say it slowly just for you no man left behind that s leadership when it comes to the matter of protecting our friends our family and our heartland do not trifle with this representative democracy for we the people will not stop we will never back down we will give out everything to protect those dear to us our republic finish the wall we are going to be the party that is known to fight when i say that if you think this vasculation of the constitution will be met with silence then you know nothing of the america i know you want my guns i know it we all know it we ll mr speaker music music wow well whoever built this stage i had to say thank you you gave me a great ramp i was like if they put a jump here could have gone straight into the crowd so first and foremost get the most important thing out of the way we all need to thank our lord jesus our lord and savior jesus christ letting us all be here today number two we need to recognize that i have been called a nationalist in the mainstream media i i ve been called somebody who cares only about america and focuses on on this nation uh the rest of the world be damned and i just said they re absolutely right so one i d like to get uh some political matters out of the way so obviously i believe conservatives are poised to take over this country very very soon i m going to have control soon i i believe that and so i want to talk about what we have that control and then i want to speak about really the most important part of what we all can do as americans as this next generation as the leaders of this country to be able to save the country so number one when we take power i think first and foremost our number one priority should be prosecuting anthony falci for lying to congress and putting them on well i believe that we are really the racing in this country is the communist chinese party uh really their their ability to infiltrate our world to infiltrate our country to influence things on the global stage i believe especially all of us in this room we re under 40 years old they will be the enemy that we will be facing uh for the rest of the century i didn t believe that so because of their terrible mishandling of covet 19 allowing it to be released from their country i believe that we should seize all chinese assets in the united states of america as a down payment for what they owe us next i genuinely believe that we need to launch some investigations when we take command one i want to figure out exactly why the nih is torturing puppies in africa number two i want to understand why we are funding gain and function research number three i would like to investigate president joe biden for if if you think about what happened he does not and i i i i ll tell you none of us in this room i think should take any joy in watching the cognitive decline of the president of the united states of america uh but i i will tell you i am so frustrated with dr jill biden his wife to force a man who is obviously going into cognitive mental decline to stand up against people who are going into the prime to where i i just wanted to call him you know happy uncle joe was the vice president one day he could stay off into the sunset but no now we have to go against him and when he disobeyed direct orders from the supreme court of the united states and did an unconstitutional action my friends that s an impeachable offense so so next i i really want to talk about and those are some political things that i think we all can do that s some things i think we can all get behind and advocate for as americans but as we are going into really the the rest of this decade the rest of 2020 i i really feel like the 1920s set the tone for all of the 20th century a lot of the things that happened you saw all these revolutions with socialism saw those revolutions with communism all across the country and i think it was because of the terrible economic upheaval that we start with that we saw in the 1920s that s what we re going through today uh in the world today and i think that we have is incumbent upon us to make sure that the world does not go in the direction that it went after the 1920s uh does not go into the direction of heading to a world war it s not going to the direction of terrible people where people are saying no let s give all the the the means of production over to the government because that s a great idea the government s never messed anything up i i would love for them to run my health care give them the empathy of the irs and the efficiency of the dmv it d be fantastic gosh if anybody here has been to the dmv recently i just want to pray for you it s it s so much worse after after 2020 uh but i ll tell you the number one way that i think we all can save this country because i believe that we all genuinely love this country is by embracing the america first doctrine by embracing you know the mag of doctrine that donald trump started when people say donald trump is the leader of the republican party i i say i think he started a revolution in this country where now we are the leaders of the conservative movement we are the leaders who are going to determine what happens in this country and i believe that our number one priority should be to really truly understand what does it mean to believe in in america first and just shout out some answers what does it mean to be america first and yeah yeah yeah incredible answers like buy american the constitution all these incredible things stand up for the flag absolutely i love that one i mean it s hard for me to stand i understand that but um but really and you know i m going to use a word that is kind of scary and yesterday i was i was trying to figure out a synonym for it but i got to talk to dennis prager and i was like hey what word could i use aside from this and then dennis said well why madison why would you not use that word he needed a cigar and have a fireside chat and and i because i wanted to say well you know being america first means that you re a nationalist that you believe in this country and just like anything else nationalism can be mistrued nationalism can become dangerous and deadly but i believe that it is incumbent upon all of us to save this nation i and now i ll tell you i i i m a devout christian i ve got a great relationship with my lord and savior and so of course i love being able to help people i love taking care of people i i think we should send missionaries out into the world we should bring people to christ i think the most important thing for us to do is to save souls to jesus really the savior of jesus christ but that s our job as christians and i believe that we are a christian nation you know almost every single one of the signers uh they were regular church attending christians who anybody wants to tell you they re atheists or dies they re idiots don t listen to them i think john level had an incredible quote when he said when you hear some horse manure just instantly can he he s much more pious man than i am i would use a different word uh but when you hear that just call it out instantly so when people say we re not a christian nation that we were founded by racist by evil men that s wrong the people who founded this nation should be revered and they should talk to the next generation as the heroes of the 18th century but i i ll tell you i believe that before we as a christian nation start going out and paying for for gender studies in egypt and giving all this foreign aid why don t we start by serving the homeless veterans on the side of the street instead of being the police force of the world some people who want to say oh my goodness well you know what there s this terrible border crisis going on in ukraine and russia vladimir putin blah blah i don t care i i really don t and i love eastern europe i m sure it s a great place but until we get our own southern border secured i don t give a damn about the border conflict in ukraine and so today i m here to make the case for being an america first patriot and when i say make the case for it i i believe that it is our duty and most of us in this room are are pretty young we re all within the same generation i see a lot of there s a lot of generations represented in this room and when i look at this room i have to tell you how honored i am to be alive when we all are alive today because i used to pray all the time uh you know i would say god you know why did you not let me be alive you know in the 1940s to fight against you know the in world war ii or to be a alive during a revolution i want to i want to be a warrior for you i want to save my country i want to do all these great things but you had me born in 1995 at the height of those peaceful and prosperous time the world has ever known you know give me an opportunity well guys i gotta say i m sorry for praying that prayer um i think god has answered in a big way and he said well you know what here s tyranny uh here are people trying to censor your speech your people trying to control every bit of your lives you re people trying to say well you have to have this forced medical operation to be able to operate in normal society what my friends you know i went to new york city it was awful but i went to new york city this past week and i was i was filming a fox hit and when i was there we went out to dinner and they were like oh we re gonna need to see your vaccine card and i said absolutely not even if i had a vaccine card i would refuse to eat here because the only way the only way that we are going to be able to get out of the situation that we are facing in this country where the tyranny is starting to come down upon us is if we start exercising a little civil disobedience if we as americans who say hey you know what i love this country more than i love my government and so if you want to give these if you want to give these unconstitutional orders i will reject them and i will go about my life because i i m just i ll shoot you the finger i really will now i know there s probably some christians in here are saying but what about in in romans where it says that you need to you know be submissive under on unto the the governments that i place in authority over you well i i understand that but does anybody know what the preamble to the constitution says what are the first three words we the people so in our founding documents it says that we are the authority it says that people like me a congressman i serve you and so when the government is not when the government is not working on your behalf it is your duty to disregard their orders it is your duty to be civilly disobedient i believe that s what we re all called to do and so i know i went into some some policy ideas of things that we can do and i have to say how sick and tired i am of having to say i m a republican and i am a republican but first and foremost i m an american and when i say that it s because all of us in this room you know we can blame antifa we can blame black lives matter we can blame joy mayor we can we can blame all these terrible people for the problems we re facing in our country but i believe the true problem that we re facing in our country is for the last six decades we have had a republican party who has sat down and allowed the radical left to run a rough shot over every single one of us we ve had this party who s just said you know what let s let s go there let s debate about tax policy and incremental gdp growth at the end of the year let s let s do all of that and when i hear all of these things it s as if these people believe that we re an economy that happens to be inside of a country no we are a country that has an economy inside of it the economy serves us and the way to make sure we have a strong economy is to make sure we have a strong society and i i believe as people who believe the america first message we are here to make sure we have the strongest america the world can ever have and the way to ensure that is to embrace judeo christian values number one but two it is to reinforce the importance of the family unit that is our number one priority any policy any policy that you hear that is trying to tell you that we re going to have government intervention into the ability for a father and a mother to raise their child should be highly scrutinized and fiercely fought against the guy none of you who are parents in this room signed up to co parent with the government and you know i i know i started out with with some policy ideas but and people will call me a radical for believing that you know you should be a christian you should get married young you should have as many kids as possible you should try and have a great job you should be as successful as you possibly can they ll say i m an extremist for that and i just look at them and i said how can you believe that i genuinely just care about dining room politics i care about that young family who s sitting around the dinner table and what are they thinking about when they re seeing their young children eat they re thinking about am i going to be able to send them to a good school one i think you should homeschool i was homeschooled all the way through i am proudly a college dropout if you are not becoming an engineer or a doctor or a lawyer i highly encourage you to drop out it s a scam um but i believe that we should care about those dining room politics that unites all of us across the board because you know if you sit down with somebody on the other side they just they kind of lean left because the culture around them is indoctrinated in it they ve been indoctrinated to it since they ve been in the government schools well if you sit there and have a conversation with them for over 10 minutes you get past all these these pre programmed indoctrinated and brainwashed pre programmed responses they have and then they actually have to sit there and talk to you using original thoughts and using common sense and common sense is contrary to everything that they believe because they ve had to spend billions of dollars to be able to try and manipulate them and so when we talk about these dining room politics these america first agenda items it s very simple stuff it s hey i want to have very very strong law enforcement i want to have the ability to be able to defend myself if you break into my home you try to hurt my family i will kill you i i believe that we should have a strong economy and the way that we do that is by encouraging people to be able to go out and take risks it s by saying hey instead of taking out that one hundred 100 000 business loan as an 18 year old or 100 000 student loan which is worthless as an 18 year old why don t you why does the government not allow us to be able to take out a 10 000 business loan at 18 to be able to go and create an economy create work create all these great things and another thing i think we should start waging into is this idea of of culture and for a long time the republican party and people that have come before us and i m not here to blame other generations i was born in this day and age and we will save this country regardless what has happened before it but for so long people have said hey don t talk about religion and politics let s not get involved in that because you might offend somebody well good i will offend you because i believe those are the most important things we can talk about if you want a bolshevik revolution in my country if you want to introduce a socialist ideology i had some members of the squad one time telling me hey you know what and i know it s it s sad pray for me i go to work every day with nancy pelosi and aoc it s awful but i had one of them one time tell me hey you know what the person i am on media and on social media you know that s just work i can be amicable outside of work and i almost was i was in the elevator with the person i almost said oh hey yeah no i understand so let s um that that that s cool yeah maybe we can grab a drink one day but then i stopped myself and i said you know what i have no desire to be friends with you outside of this environment because you are trying to indoctrinate my generation to believe that the most lethal ideology in history that killed 100 million people in the 20th century is good and moral and just you are trying to steal my generation s ability to write their own destiny away from them so no i have no desire to be your friend and in fact i will defeat you in every single aspect of this world and now again the the the more typical republican probably would have said well oh yeah no that s great let s go out and get a drink and let s all be a part of this uniparty and let s vote against our constituents absolutely not the remember like i said we the people is the preamble to the constitution preamble to what we believe you all are in charge i serve you and so if i have a socialist who s trying to destroy your lives i don t care about being friends with them outside of the country when you have one of your radical family members who s gone to brownell or some ridiculous university and been indoctrinated and come home and said well mother i m now actually non binary and sir if you could refer to me as he as as a woman she says that if somebody wants to change their name and i i i have a lot of empathy for this if a guy wants to change his name to some feminine name my name is madison so again i haven t believed this and he wants to be called ashley i ve got no problem with that that s cool that s your decision but if you want me to sit here and call a man a woman you are asking me to buy into this lie and i ll say no to that i will say no to that in every single way and now don t get me wrong i will defend i i don t care if you re if you re trans if you re gay if you re muslim if you re black if you re white i will defend your constitutional rights as hard as i can at all times no matter what but i believe again i believe that we as conservatives need to start waging into this cultural war because when you want to take your ideology and now force it onto our children well we are going to fight against that and it is our duty to do so when you want to say that mothers who go and speak at a school board meeting are are domestic terrorists well my friends when i take power back i will be holding you accountable to that the things that you want to hold us accountable for i will start launching investigations into you and we ll start figuring out who the real domestic terrorists are because remember my friends it the things that unite us as americans are very simple because one and we all have a pretty strong libertarian streak that runs through us i genuinely believe that and i think libertarianism is great i would be a full on libertarian if i lived in 1806 and people believed uh in in the ten commandments as as much as they did back then but unfortunately we don t live in that world now and so i i believe that cultural conservatism is the only way that we re gonna be able to save our country i believe that encouraging strong family values regardless of the backlash you re gonna fake regardless of the arrows that you re gonna take in the back is the only way that we save this country i believe that encouraging people to instead of encouraging churches just we ll get as many baptisms as you can get as many offering places you can as many donations as you can you know let s encourage the church to stand up and get off the sideline and start working on discipleship rather than just rather than just baptism because if you go back and you look through the 1750s and the 1760s to look back at what the pastors back in those days were actually talking about it s as if they ve just read the newspaper the week before and said huh i wonder what the bible says about that i m gonna go preach on that but now we have all these woke christian pastors who are coming out and wanting to say oh well let s fly the black lives matter flag out there let s let s do all these things it s disgusting christians are you re not here to protect your tax exempt status as a pastor you are here to be salt and light in this earth you should demand that of your pastors and guys you know i m looking at this clock and to the people backstage i m sorry i m probably going to go to a minute over i i i the times run away from me i had a lot more points that i wanted to make but i i just want us all to lean in for a second to really hear the last bit of words that i m going to say is that i m sure you all have heard charlie kirk say this many times that in our country um you know if we just if we believe that we re going to radically change our country and get back to our founding values and it s not going to cost us anything then we are fooling ourselves my friends i i believe that we as the patriotic americans who were born for such a time as this as esther s uncle told her in the time to to influence the secular government of our time god put us here because he knew that we could handle it and if we could handle it while being able to lean on him and i will tell you we re going to face some dark times as a nation i genuinely believe that i think we have an opportunity the next four to six years to prevent kinetic american forces countrymen on countrymen from ever meeting and i think that is incumbent upon all of us although i have no doubt that we d be victorious better happen but remember that would be that would be so immoral and wrong if we just said hey you know what let s just let s just kick off a civil war and then we ll we ll just go ahead and go to that point no my friends we were called to be innocent as doves yes but we were also called to be shrewd as snakes and we as conservatives it s time for us to get shrewd it s time for us in genesis it talks about taking dominion of the earth you read that original word i mean it means go out and take control of it take dominate the earth that you re given fill it and my friends the only way we re going to do that is if we stop playing this lackluster milk toast defensive game where we re all just saying hey i don t want to offend anybody i don t want to talk about religion and politics no i m going to lean in i m going to take some punches on the chin i think all of us in this room are too and we are going to stand up for the america that we all know and believe in because when we do that when we stop saying oh yeah i believe in free trade no screw that i believe in dominant american trade when i ask opec for oil although we ll drill it here they re gonna say yes sir we ll give it all right away thank you so much for all that you ve done my friends as americans it s time for us to stop being sheep stand up and be lions let s make these people be the last thing i m going to say because we re about to start playing music last thing i m going to say is that the radical left should be terrified of who we are the radical left should be terrified of what we are going to do and if you want to introduce a globalist agenda in this country well we are going to politically uh psychologically in every form that we can confront you we will defeat the globalists in this nation my friends is up to all of us thank you all so much music applause music nothing protects your wealth like gold and silver when you buy from the right source at republic monetary exchange we do business in person take immediate delivery of your gold and silver and if you need to sell get immediate payment no waiting and no worries that s how we do business risk free don t wait weeks for your gold or money from a broker you ve never seen republic monetary exchange gold and silver immediate delivery that s how we do business camelback just east of 40th street the politicians don t want you to know what they re up to secret slush funds secret emails and pay to play judicial watch is your watchdog in washington dc shining in the light of transparency on our nation s capital the lockdowns will go down as one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country bar none you have money you can survive a lockdown you don t you have to fight everything i stand for is for the betterment of the individual as soon as the government comes in and starts to take freedoms away from us it s very hard to get them back i love the opinion that you could do what is right if i let you say your nonsense let me say my facts this is a cultural fire alarm i believe in the american ethos this is a movement of optimism and one of hope it s always been we it s time for our generation to start to rise up and take back america for freedom applause music thank you thank you everybody i i never get used to that the fire right as you turn around the corner please sit down everybody what a great couple days hasn t it this has been incredible and i got to tell you we do so much at turning point usa on campus high school college chapters uh we re working really hard and as you can see look around you the team went above and beyond at turning point usa to make sure that you you had a special couple days and you know from the country music to the early worship on sunday to all the breakouts to the sponsors it really was a very very special weekend and i am happy to say that all of you can now say that you were part of the largest multi day conservative event in american history it s amazing so i want to talk about a couple of things as we kind of close this conference and then of course we have the wonderful kaylee mcinney coming up which is i mentioned this briefly in our opening remarks and turning point usa we are a student organization first and foremost and i think we need to kind of zero in on the problems and the issues that are facing our generation and generation z now i m what would be called a transgenerational i get to choose what generation i m part of so i i disavow millennials okay so i get to be generation z um or whatever but whether it s millennial generation z and every parent out here as i talk about this i m not blaming the older generation for these conditions but it s important that we do take a step back and say that young people are there they re entering into a world that is completely and fundamentally different than one that was in the 1980s and 1990s this is the most depressed most suicidal most drug addicted most alcohol addicted least married uh most childless generation in american history and we should take a pause and ask ourselves the question what is causing this and what are we doing to stop it first and foremost on an individual level then on a family level than a community level and then on a national political level and first on the individual level um i think that one of the major issues that we re seeing is that we have a generation that is searching for meaning and searching for purpose and you see that here at this conference the most enthusiastic applause lines and speakers are people are not just saying that the right is good and the left is bad but instead of saying here s what you got to do to get your life in order to find something that s actually going to live longer than you you see one of the major mistakes we ve made in america and we re fixing it here at america fest is that we used to tell young people that you re the problem and you have a lot of work to do and america s wonderful now we say to young people you re wonderful and america s terrible we totally flipped it upside down and one of the main reasons why we have over a hundred thousand young people that have overdosed on opioids in the this this year alone one hundred thousand young people is that students and members of generation z and millennials they look around they say that there is no purpose or meaning or place for me and that s one of the big lies you want to talk about the big lie the big lie is allowing a generation to literally believe that there is no place for them to be able to succeed and flourish in this country and so you look at the statistics it s the most suicidal generation in american history now if i were to ask the audience how many of you know someone personally that committed suicide almost ever raise your hand almost every single hand goes up this should be a fire alarm for our civilization by the way and by the way it s way more important than systemic racism i m well i m way more interested in systemic suicide in our country than systemic racism which doesn t exist by the way which is systemic racism does not exist in america but stomach suicide does and what is causing this well there s a lot of different factors i think technology is playing a huge role in this in fact i think that and i see this all the time and i don t mean to offend anybody but honestly if i do i don t care this is the last day so um and you re not getting a refund so uh sorry which is when i see eight year olds at a at a restaurant and no one s talking to one another and everyone s staring at screens and they give a seven year old an ipad which is basically a digital pacifier i think there s something really wrong with that i think there s something deeply unhealthy with that and so some of you might remember last year in palm beach at the student action summit i gave a list of things that i would like everyone to do and i was pretty kind of intensely um against technology and then you know this year was a wonderful year i got married in may which was awesome and i encourage every young person to get married early it s not a joke when i say that you should reject hookup culture you should save yourself for one human being and get married early i i don t give advice to young women on how to find a man uh i will say to young men uh get your act together and really make self control and self discipline a priority in your life one of the reasons why so many young women are upset with the dating pool i hear this all the time is that they see men that can t control themselves and they and as you can tell the young ladies are very enthusiastic about hearing this and by the way here s a thought crime for you women want to be led women want to be led by strong men and you will men are different than women and women are different than men and both need each other by the way and so when i got married back in may to my wonderful wife i decided to turn my phone off completely for 10 days just turn it off and just focus on each other focus on god and it was one of the most incredible experiences for a variety of reasons and as i look back at this year this that was really a couple days that changed my life where we went on this incredible honeymoon in paradise and we were focusing on one another and focusing on the natural beauty and focusing on god and all these amazing things and we were looking around at these other people that were vacationing and honeymooning by the way and they weren t focusing on each other they were like strangely bringing their friends from 2000 miles away into paradise either like because they re so they re so kind of like unable to deal with the current moment or they re so narcissistic they need to tell everybody that they re on the beach in the caribbean and what was amazing is watching couple after couple and family after family not even with kids there no one was talking to one another instead they were snapchatting and instagraming and going through tick tock meanwhile there s a whole world out there that they were missing and i realized that the introduction of this technology it doesn t it look technology can be a positive but i think that s a bad argument you know a lot of people say you know technology only gives you more of what you already have and less of what you don t have i don t think that s true i think these phones are changing who we actually are as human beings i think that it s actually remaking what we get angry about what we get happy about and what we what we value and so after the honeymoon i uh did a lot of thinking and i wrote a whole piece about this and i i asked and i ve always been super jealous of practicing jews that were that practiced the sabbath and then i asked myself well why didn t why don t we do that as christians more right and i i really did a lot of thinking in in july i said okay friday night i m going to start doing the sabbath turn off my phone no technology at first it was really hard i got to be honest you re really anxious like am i missing something and in august september october november every friday night for 25 hours and yes 25 that s right you add an hour on uh for an extra hour of prayer meditation um i started this year just completely turning my phone off off the grid right giving one day to god and i have to tell you right now um it was this amazing revelation of something i would always be saying in front of audiences but then i realized how true it was which is that god gave us the law to bless us you see in the decalogue the ten commandments uh a great example is that one of the only ten commandments ted commandment that actually uh comes with a promise is on your mother and father so you might live long in the land of which you are in good advice for every student out there honor your parents it s very important every totalitarian country tries to break the bond between parents and children they do this time and time again this is why queer theory transgender theory critical race theory locism diversity inclusion they re trying to break the bond between a parent and child but also it says very clearly that we must dedicate one day to god and in mark two or mark three it says that um this that we were not made for the sabbath the sabbath was made for man is that this is a gift for us and you look in this hyper technological world where everything is moving so fast and you re you re you might be in this room right now or watching online you might be super anxious and someone might be trying to push medication on you that you don t need by the way and someone might be trying to tell you that like oh all you have to do is do weed bad idea by the way don t do that and like oh yeah just take a hit of weed or all you have to do is drink before you go to bed and like you know that these substances probably aren t going to give you what you re looking for when have you tried dedicating one day out of the week to the lord and turning off that stupid smartphone have you tried that because i could tell you it was a massive blessing to me in 2021 is that all of a sudden it re centers your whole week you journal you read books i know it s a radical thing um and like you could you could do it to varying degrees some people don t get in cars uh i i m i drive around sometimes on the sabbath sometimes i was traveling so i had to give a speech and just was it kind of wasn t able to cancel the point is that throughout the day you re not constantly checking for emails and messages instead you re like oh i m without kind of this this coping mechanism i carry around with me otherwise known as a smartphone and so this year as i look back at it i don t know if we d be able to have an event like this or the success we had if i personally wouldn t have realized that the lord commands us to take one day to rest in the midst of all the craziness and look some of you might be busier than me you might be um if you make if you traveled more than 330 days this year and did more than 600 podcasts and met you know have over 200 people on staff 200 full time people on staff and have to raise a lot of money maybe you re better than me maybe i m not saying the busiest person i m not the point is that if i m able to do the sabbath i really encourage you guys to do this in fact i think that if just all regular americans turned off tik tok facebook instagram youtube and apple all of a sudden i think it would make america an infinitely better place to live i truly do so a couple other things i want to share with you and by the way if i think that could help solve some of the issues of suicide alcoholism drug addiction just that alone and because i think it actually helps lead other things okay um my other advice to students and young people and again super contrarian um but it s true is that you want first you have to know what you want it s a really important thing i know that sounds so obvious but so many young people don t even know what they want which is why they re so miserable right is that they don t even know what is good or what is um what is tragic or what is wonderful and so you should want to be good at saying no and not everyone s good at this by the way you you should want you should desire to be able to say no to your flesh and to temptation and to things that sound good and feel good in the moment here s a little secret for you the highest productive most productive people that you saw speak on the stage the people that you might look up to like tucker carlson they have made life choices that are permanent that say no to things that might make them feel good immediately for example tucker carlson doesn t drink right not not everyone knows that and so now by the way i m not a if you if you drink i really don t care i m not a moralist in that sense however that to compe to compete at the level tucker carlson s at to go do a nightly news show and to write it unique and all that he admits that alcohol would weigh him down that he wouldn t be able to do what he does and so here s the lie that you re being told you can t have it all you can t you have to prioritize some things you can you re gonna have to let go of things that might make you feel good in the moment to go pursue something that is more meaningful than an instant dopamine kick and here s another good rule for life if it feels good in the moment it s probably not good for you if it feels good immediately it s probably not good for you and again i there there s extremes to that right like working out can feel really good um there s also extremes to that again you can make your own choices you can see what you see fit but i know right now that at least half the room this is resonating at some fundamental level because if you re like man i got to get my life together going to 2022 i m not performing at the highest level i can well then you should desire to be able to say no okay the other thing for all the young people out there um you know my you know my thoughts on college we run a college organization i think it s a scam um i think most people shouldn t go to college you know that i speak openly about it and um i think parents sending your kids to college is playing russian roulette with your kids values right um and the wisest most incredibly incredible people i think the ones that don t go to college now of course i lose my audience because you re like okay i m in college that doesn t do any good charlie okay so i get it and i m just i m talking to high schoolers as well and by the way less than five percent of people that go to college probably need to go to college um the 95 it doesn t really do much for you it doesn t instead here s the charge that you should have two things you should try to become a better person that s the most important thing number two thing we need more young people to start new things we need more young people to start new churches to start new businesses to start new families you see college doesn t teach you any of this i always laugh when people say i m studying entrepreneurship like you don t study entrepreneurship you do entrepreneurship okay like it s like i m studying how to you know do we need so what my challenge to you is for there s some young person out there you have a business idea go do it when you are 18 19 and 20 years old guess what here s a little secret you could always go back to college always they ll allow you as long as the check clears it s true it s not some rule that you have to go when you re 18 and by the way it s mostly stuff that you re either gonna regret or forget that s mainly what college is okay regretting and forgetting but guess what if you re 18 you say well charlie what do i do instead super easy find something you re good at that s something you have a passion for two totally different things i have a passion for college football very mediocre unless if you watch the relief factor ad then i m actually really good so um and but a skill i have is not that find your skill not your passion but again hopefully it s not a skill that you like totally hate hopefully you like it and then here s the thing it s so simple go find someone who s really good and has perfected what your skill is and go ask them for a job or an unpaid internship that s that simple you don t need to go to college to do that you need to be willing to succeed it s that simple and guess what you want you want to stand out if you re if you re a 16 year old and you really want to stand up by the way parents your i could just feel the anxiety the sweat the denunciation the preparedness to say charlie was wrong in the ride over i i hear the conversation and that s you know what i embrace it fully because if someone needs to say the stuff out loud because it s true which is if you re 16 17 or 18 and you have that skill and you go find someone who s good at that all of a sudden you want to stand out if you want to be the person that people remember it s not going to harvard stanford princeton or yale or any of that nonsense you want to stand out be the kid that asked for an internship that was scrappy enough hungry enough and humble enough to go sweet floors to learn the actual thing you need to do that ll make you stand out if you want to go find a job and you want to climb up in what you want to do in the future okay learn something new every single day something that excites me about all of you and i just want to thank you guys are like the best audience the those who that support turning point usa those that support our podcast thank you thank you thank you you guys are so unbelievable especially those that listen to our podcast and support it i m so touched by that and something that really motivates me and encourages me is all of your desire to learn and this is a great sign by the way if you want to be optimistic about something it s that every single one of you you have a special focus and intensity lately to want to dive deeper into our history into our ideas and to where we came from guess what that s a sign of a winning coalition so here s my challenge to you especially young people people of all ages is take a journal and say i learned this about my country today i learned this about philosophy today a people that are learning constantly you ll be able to find the answers in the clarity necessary to act and to be able to hold these tyrants and these authoritarians and these despicable narcissists accountable learn something new every single day and so say well charlie how do i do that okay i ll make it really easy for you we partnered with hillsdale college they re amazing guys go to charlie for hillsdale com uh we have some hillsdale students here i think we do um it s and you guys can take their online course it s super easy listen to my podcast you can listen to tucker whatever it is make learning as important as bodybuilders make weightlifting so i want you to think about that is that if you re not using your mind every single by the way the mind is a beautiful gift from the lord and most people just kind of go through the motions they don t really think deeply about what s going on around them there s so much wonder and wisdom that will make your life so much more fulfilling you want to know why this generation is so suicidal we ve told them that there s no truth worth pursuing we ve told them that there s no absolute truths we told them that oh you re just a bunch of cells a bunch of chemicals just do things that make you feel good when in reality we know there s a transcendent order where there s a creator that loves us and that we re made in his image and that you want to know the beginning of philosophy it starts with wonder like wow there s so much in this world that i really don t understand and wisdom is the knowledge of things that do not change wisdom is the knowledge of how human beings act and also things that are just as true as they were 200 years ago 500 years ago a thousand years ago practical knowledge is important wisdom or eternal knowledge is the most important thing finally i want to just say that um one of my favorite bible verses that i don t think gets quoted enough is philippians 4 6 through 8 which is do not be anxious but instead um through prayer thanksgiving and supplication make your requests known to god uh for the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard and protect will guard and protect your heart and mind in all circumstances and whatever s good whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is beautiful whatever is kind i get those words mixed up sometimes ponder and think on those things for through christ jesus he will set you free one of my favorite verses and basically the whole idea is this and i know there s this is a huge problem a mental health problem in our country is very significant everybody and it shouldn t be made fun of but we must understand that the lord gave us tools and abilities especially for young people out there for you to break free and to break through of maybe getting trapped in your own head maybe getting trapped in your own thoughts maybe the constant negativity that s around you here s the amazing message of positivity and optimism i have for you is that through jesus christ through the teaching of the scriptures through things that are totally true and wise and eternally true that every single person here can break through of any of that cycle of negativity you re in right now and that tomorrow can be a much better day than today was and today should be a better day than yesterday and you can actually commit yourself to that sort of improvement because guess what we have free will we have agency and we have the ability to continue to improve and guess and you put all that together that s what makes america so incredibly special is that in this country you are able to use the liberty that the lord gives you because liberty is not man s idea it s god s idea to be able to pursue virtue and things that are always true so i just want to encourage this generation you guys get insulted way too much by let s just say boomers okay this generation there s gonna be something very special that happens out of this generation this generation is starting to wake up they see the cost of the lockdowns the masks and the vaccine mandates they re starting to ask questions and this generation is going to be one that is going to turn get it the trajectory of the nation towards one that is filled of liberty and freedom and virtue and eternal things and that s really what we at turning point usa fight for every single day god bless you guys thank you so much music applause music so music i never lied i source my information but that will never stop the press from calling you a liar we must be on offense confident bold and willing to call it out we cannot be silent kim sake promised us a daily white house press briefing there isn t one today there wasn t one monday when the going gets tough the daily press briefing that she promised goes out the window you don t have to press core you don t have the shouted questions because they simply do not care where are the investigative journalists we are fighting for the rights of all americans freedom is at risk ronald reagan said invest freedom is one generation away from extinction uh and that is why we bring children into this world carry on the message of the united states of america of your family and of your faith whatever that may be carry on the values that we hold dear applause music wow applause music applause music applause music wow music thank you sorry i was not awkwardly holding up my phone i was doing an instagram live so you all were on there thank you so much guys for being here it s an honor to close out america fest have you all had fun i love it well as you all know you may have watched i spent a lot of time taking questions from the white house podium but i have a question today an important question what is going on at 1600 pennsylvania avenue what is going on i mean just last week i watched our president joe biden refer to president kamala harris okay so then i i flip over to see what the vice president s up to and literally she s doing this interview with charlemagne did any of you see it this is a direct quote no no no no no and don t start talking like a republican and it s joe biden and it s joe biden and it s joe biden and i m vice president and my name is kamala harris what is wrong with this lady what is wrong i mean i don t know what s worse who s out of it more joe biden or kamala it s really a toss up which is mildly concerning because they re running our country but there s that a lot has changed i mean i think president trump is a vast change from joe biden we re seeing the disaster of the joe biden presidency but not only has the president changed the leader of the free world the questions coming from the white house reporters have changed have you guys noticed that or maybe you re not watching the briefings i don t know they are a bit difficult to watch i limit the time that i watch them but when i do watch them i m just absolutely stunned by what i hear from the press corps the first briefing that jensaki gave one of the questions asked from the press corps was this could you give us some color about what it was like for joe biden going into the oval office he s been waiting for this for so long what was his reaction wow i would have loved that question never got it then there was this will joe biden keep donald trump s air force one color scheme hard hitting question and there is this can you clarify for us what happened with the president s dog there are some reports that one of them was involved in a biting accident to which jim sake replied there was one bite we later learned many months down the road there were multiple bites i m not sure why you would mislead on something as innocuous as a dog bite but indeed that s the lay of the land there at the white house and then my favorite question was this any update on the white house cat whoa now compare rewind when i was at the podium here s some of these stellar questions that were asked of me let me ask if i can kaylee why does the president keep hiring people who are dumb as a rock overrated way over their heads wacko and incompetent was a question then there was so you ve used the phrase warriors to describe everyday americans fighting the pandemic the president s using that phrase as well what s the thinking behind using that description and is he bet are is he basically asking americans to put themselves in harm s way harm s way like warriors do no i think he s just praising the american people for fighting through covet 19 but there you go and then there was the question you can literally go back and watch i m like flipping through the pages of my binder finding my tab and then i pause and i look up like this in total bewilderment because this is the question i was asked does president trump believe that it was a good thing that the south lost the civil war really they say there s no such thing as a dumb question but make no mistake that is a very dumb question applause but i ll tell you the answers coming from the podium have changed as well there s a lot of deception we were told that republicans want to defund the police republicans they literally said that and for that one the so called fact checkers woke up and gave the administration three pinocchios that s rare for a liberal president but they did that we were told biden never called the travel restrictions on china xenophobic he did you can go find the tweet we re told there s no crisis on the southern border no tens of thousands of illegal immigrants sitting under a bridge in del rio and human excrement and squalid conditions that s not a crisis the white house tells us that that s not a crisis i m not sure what the definition of crisis is because that s pretty squarely a crisis we were told there s not a crime problem it s just a gun problem we were told that that build back better which thank goodness joe manchin joe manson he deserves the clap joe manchin put an end to we re told it would cost zero dollars the white house is still saying that lie then there s the lie that trump never did anything constructive in the middle east we were told that okay wait one two three middle east peace deals more than any president before him i think he did something constructive in the middle east but nevertheless that is what we are told but let me back up about how i got to the podium because i think it s an instructive story for anyone who wants to pursue a career in politics media or whatever you want to pursue my opportunity at the podium really came out of nowhere i was riding in the car with my daughter baby blake in the back and my mom s driving and i get this call my phone it was an odd set of numbers and i knew it to be the white house switchboard and i knew the president not well i would say we had spoken a handful of times i had seen him on the campaign trail because i was his campaign press secretary but i get this call like trying to keep my daughter quiet pink pacifier in the mouth like stay quiet it s the president of the united states calling and he called and out of the blue he said can i ask you a question and i said sure and he said would you be interested in being my white house press secretary which i responded mr president that would be the honor of my lifetime to which and he responded with mark get it done and i think he met mark meadows go get it done but it was it was surreal uh because i had interned in the white house for the bush administration i had watched dana perino give a press briefing she s great love her my calling now at fox you know i had interned at fox i had worked my way up through the political ranks and this idea of standing at a podium where i was just an intern in the back of the room watching the press secretary at the podium it was something to take in but that s where hard work can get you i believe in this room we have a future white house press secretary maybe even a future president i m so impressed with all of you but i ll tell you i had a lot of apprehension after taking the job i wondered if i d be able to do it it was a big task taking to the podium during covid 19 i was riding up with my husband and his truck up the eastern corridor and i was a kind of a nerd in college and in high school and i was on the debate team i loved preparation so you know i m madly reading academic journal articles about how to be a good press secretary i m calling people i m like how do i do this and my dad texted me this salient message that just cut through the noise and of course preparation is important but he said to me kaylee maybe you were made quote for such a time as this applause and those words are from the book of esther esther 414 separately apart from my dad a liberal democratic commentator said to me kaylee maybe you were made for such a time as this and i don t know about all of you but if you re a believer in this room a lot of times when god s trying to send you a message he sends the same message through two different people or you hear it in a sermon and then you immediately open your devotional and you see the same message that s when god s trying to beat you over the head and say hey i want you to have this message and he indeed wanted me to have that message thank you my first day came it was april 13th 2020 and i m going to the white house and it s pouring rain not the ideal way to start a new job i m in the press secretary s office sitting there taking in the moment as i have like water up to my knees on my pants it was like not ideal but you know i m sitting there and i get a call later in the day first day s press secretary kaley come to the oval office and though i had been an intern though i had been a trump supporter for a while i had never been inside the oval office so my first trip into the oval office is to brief the president of the united states and i passed this mahogany grandfather clock that s off to the left when you walk in the oval office and i go on onto the sunbeam pattern rug that president reagan his administration had designed and president trump repurposed it for his oval office and i sit across from the resolute desk that was a desk that was gifted to us from queen victoria in 1880 and i m sitting there on this gold couch thinking i m gonna have to brief the president of the united states and i watch him and i quickly learned he doesn t prep questions like where i d be in my office and my team would come in and ask me questions and we d think through the question and answer he really put a lot of focus on his introduction and the scripted remarks and he s in a binder much like this one and i m watching him and he s taking a sharpie and he s crossing through things he tore parts he didn t like one time i think i even saw him take scissors and just chop a part off so instead of his staff editing his remarks that s how he did things and i realized we re not going to have a lot of time for questions so as he s about to walk out i go mr president i know what you re going to be asked today and he said what s that and i go well dr falchi always causing a problem in the white house dr falchi went out on cnn and said look maybe if mitigation would have started sooner than you know perhaps uh we could have saved more lives to which the press was spinning and contorting and saying dr fauci said trump could have saved more lives so i told the president that he said well what would you say now i had been a religious watcher of the white house chrono virus task force briefings and my parents would come in and i would say i d pause it and say when you all stop talking i will resume i have to take my notes and so i ve had watched these three things i had all the facts in my head and i said mr president here s what i d say i would say on january 6 there was not a single confirmed case of coven 19 and you issued a travel notice for wuhan on january 11 still zero cases cdc issued a level one travel notice january 21st the cdc activated an emergency operations center there was just one coveted case at that time and then on january 31st you implemented the travel ban on china that your opponent joe biden called xenophobic and he said go type that up for me so run back to my office i type it up i type it up and i give it to him and he would never read a scripted answer to a question because unlike the current guy he s the commander in chief he s the one calling the shots he s the one making the decisions the information s in his mind he doesn t need to read a scripted note from a staffer like joe biden does but on that day only time i saw the president do this he read that timeline word for word and i thought good job for the first day in the white house kaylee applause so the president was doing the briefings and i wondered if i d ever be asked to give a briefing it had been 400 days since a press secretary had ever given a briefing and then out of nowhere trump looks at me and says give a briefing kaylee i thought oh wow this is like on a wednesday and then he said it again and again and i thought okay i need to give myself weeks to prepare at least a week i need to get a binder together and finally on like thursday he said do a briefing and do it before monday so wow this is gonna be a quick 24 hour turnaround which by the way i think i know why the president said for me to give a briefing one day uh he said to me i would take very good personal notes just for my personal consumption um and i d write them down and one day he said to me kaylee let me see those notes so i show them the notes these are beautiful notes and anytime he would meet with governor senators you name it he would tell me to hold up my notebook like a proud father so all could see them and i think he said you know if kaylee could take notes and have all this together she can do a briefing so i get ready to do the briefing i get the binder together and i ll tell you that binder that became something uh that was written about by cnn among others that there s actually a camera behind me and they would take pictures of my binder to try to get the tabs and i guess get some intel i don t know why quite they were taking the pictures of my binder from behind me but it led cnn to write this uh decoding the mysteries of kayleigh mcinerney s briefing book now we thought instead of having like covid therapeutics testing we would do like jim acosta john carl caitlin collins as the tabs that would have been really fun and that is a big regret that we did not do that head fake for the reporters applause but oh thank you i love you guys thank you but i ll tell you as we prepared to go to the podium that day we put in all the work all the human preparation uh but i ll tell you the most important thing i did was on the spiritual side i that morning the morning of my first briefing may 1st 2020 i listened to a joyce meyer sermon about faith over fear i prayed i listened to christian music i tweeted out philippians 4 13 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me but i will tell you i got a lot of messages coming in from christians like sarah sanders my predecessor who said to me i read my jesus calling before every before every briefing and she she s great i love her she shared with me the message from exactly two years prior in her jesus calling and it said this you are on the path of my choosing there is no randomness about your life as you give yourself more and more to a life of constant communion with me you will find that you simply have no time to worry but i worried that day i worried a lot i was very nervous so i actually was so nervous that i was crying in my office when i was supposed to be at the podium my assistant came in and was like kayla you can t be crying you need to be at at the white house podium and so she got my parents on speaker phone and we all prayed together and then i went to the west wing private bathroom i got on my knees and i said a prayer and when i walked to that podium when i stood at that podium i had gone from tears to utter and complete serenity i i m telling you i felt like i was meant to be there applause and it wasn t because of me i can tell you that i felt that peace it was because i heard it all the time from people like you that you prayed for the administration and we felt it i certainly felt it i thank you for that but look my press shop i decided my dad said to me come up with a motto for the press shop and i said okay i need to come up with the motto what do i want to be the guiding principle of this press office and i thought about it and i came up with offense only offense only because for a long time i had seen conservatives maligned trashed defamed by the liberal media and i walked in with no illusion as to who i was dealing with tried to get start out on a good foot with the media but they very quickly made it personal you saw some of the attacks and questions they were asked and to be honest it reminds me a lot of what you all go through on your college campuses and i write about that in my book you know my time at harvard law school where i loved it it was a dream of mine to go there it was uh walking walking to the class in those crisp fall mornings it was a real honor they have the socratic method in law school where they grill you on a case and it s really good preparation for taking to a podium one day but i ll tell you this i was so dismayed at the environment at harvard law from some of the students in particular i left academia i think right when it started to get really really bad and i know you guys feel it on your campuses i left right in 2014 well it was actually two years later but 2014 was really a turning point that was the ferguson shooting as some of you may remember and there were a lot of protests on campuses and you know i simply spoke out and said look i love our police they re great hard working men and women before you eyes darren wilson let s wait for the facts to come out that s it that s all i said but they didn t wait they did not wait for the facts to come out because obama s own department of justice obama s department of justice concluded based on this investigation the department has concluded that darren wilson s actions do not constitute prosecutor prosecutable violations but nevertheless i was called vitriolic for standing up for the police um they re literally it got so bad where they put tape in on the wall of the student common area and they said privileged speech goes on this side and non privileged speech goes on this side that s how caustic it got on campus which is why it s so important for us to speak truth and to be bold even though it s hard because the tactics that i experience from the press corps are the same tactics that the left is bringing to your college campus so with grace and with kindness and with compassion but with truth we have to be bold and stand firm in our convictions and that s exactly what i did with the press and since i left i will say there has been a whole lot of vindication for the trump administration which is why i m so glad that we shared our the truth boldly from the podium uh for example and i think i i run through these at any speech i do because i think it s so important to have accountability for the liberal hyenas in the press corps so npr here s what they told us this was a headline that i had to deal with at the podium peaceful protesters tear gas to clear way for trump church photo op you remember that when st john s church burn it s the church across from the white house well we were told that trump tear gassed and public protesters for that photo op and i said no that was not the case i told them but they ran with their headlines like the washington post inside the push to tear gas protesters ahead of the trump photo op washington post also from tiananmen square to lafayette square they literally compared the two cnn s jim acosta oh jim do you notice i always used to say i like your thai gym it was a way to like soften them up before going in for the attack um i wonder if i did that this day when he asked me if the white house the president and his team had to do it all over again would you have gassed and pummeled protesters to clear the park so the president could have a photo op oh wait eight months later the department of interior inspector general department of interior inspector general not a right wing news source found this we determined that the evidence did not support a finding that the u s park police cleared the park on june 1st 2020 so that then president trump could have a photo op okay so those headlines were all lies and we now know that to be the case then there was the russia bounty story this was so deeply personal and disgusting the new york times reported that russia had bounties on the heads of american servicemen and women in afghanistan and president trump did nothing about it that was the reporting i stood at the podium and i said this is not verified there is no consensus on this intelligence and in fact there are dissenting views on this intelligence and i even warned before buying into a narrative from the new york times that falsely state something about the president wait for the facts to come out they didn t wait no listen to this irony the current president joe biden accused trump of dereliction of duty how crazy is that now because there s one person who engaged in dereliction of duty and it was president joe biden when he left those troops in afghanistan and left american citizens in afghanistan applause president trump was accused of treason uh new york this is the sickest part of it all to me the new york times literally went to gold star families so families who lost their son or daughter in war and said to them convince them that their son or daughter might have died because president trump didn t take action how sick is that i mean you think of the pain of a gold star family i can t imagine losing a child and then you re told that it was preventable possibly and it was all lie the entire story was a lie and we know the story was a lie because 10 months later biden s intelligence community biden s intelligence community found this the left wing daily beast u s intelligence walks back claim that russians put bounties on american troops it was a huge election time story that prompted cries of treason but according to a newly disclosed assessment donald trump might have been right to call it a hoax it was all a lie yeah can you go to the covid lab leak i ll never forget president trump saying hey so covet 19 coronavirus may have originated in the lab in wuhan where they re working on coronavirus makes a whole lot of sense right well not to the press usa today said trump says u s investigating whether coronavirus spread after china lab mishap but cites no evidence npr scientists npr actually said this debunk the lab accident theory of pandemic emergence washington post fact checker was the new coronavirus accidentally released from a wuhan lab it s doubtful and there was cnn anthony fauci just crushed donald trump s theory on the origins of the coronavirus oh wait one year later one year later washington post how the wuhan lab leak theory suddenly became credible are you sensing a pattern here all of these lies from the press have been categorically debunked many months later but where are the firings of the press where are the changed headlines where is the accountability it does not exist applause but look at young women leadership summit i had a woman come up to me and a young girl and she said to me it s hard to feel optimistic like that those are all problems those are all you know terrible things but you know what what could should give me optimism for the way forward um and there s great cause for optimism and here s why the media has been exposed if you look at the polling axios in january of this year found that for the first time ever in edelman trust barometer history fewer than half of all americans have trust in traditional media get this this is pretty eye opening 56 of americans agree with the statement that journalists and reporters are purposely trying to mislead people by saying things they know to be false or grossly exaggerated 56 percent that s a big number and out of 46 countries surveyed for trust in press guess where the united states ranks dead last people are waking up they see it and they see it when you look at the polling quinnipiac s a left wing polling organization far left wing polling organization and one of my favorite things to do is keep track of their polls that show the crumbling biden presidency and i have a little notebook and every time the quinnipiac poll comes out i get to cross out the number and it goes a few numbers lower so i just cross them out cross them out and you can literally see joe biden s presidency just going whoosh um and here here s the numbers and it s bad for our country let me be clear about that it s bad for our country we want this country to succeed no matter who is president it s a travesty to watch but it s encouraging to see that the american people are recognizing that he is directly corresponding to the problems that we face so the numbers are in from left wing quinnipiac 50 percent disapprove of biden s covid response 59 disapprove of biden s economy 58 disapprove of biden s foreign policy 65 percent disapprove of biden s handling of afghanistan 67 percent disapprove of biden s handling of the border crisis and overall just 36 percent approve of the biden presidency wow that is enormous but look we need you i was just a young girl with a lot of passion i wrote in my dad s truck listened to the late great rush limbaugh i was a rush baby rush limbaugh and formed my entire political compass and then i grew up in the the pews of my local southern baptist church and that s where i learned something greater than political truth and it is the truth that jesus christ is lord and savior but i took truth and i turned it into action and i am so encouraged that i hear from you all and hear what you re doing on your campuses because you re doing just the same uh because we re at a crossroads never before have we been at a place like this where our police officers are absolutely demonized i remember riding through the streets of dc and seeing acab spray painted all across the city on the veterans affairs sign acab all cops are and i won t say that horrible word but they re under attack uh socialism is quietly creeping through the halls of congress that s exactly what the buildback better plan would have done but it s a scary place anti semitism some of the things i ve heard from democratic congress women anti semitic remarks from the squad and the like it s reprehensible and then there s afghanistan i ve always said this was a turning point for this president for this country and indeed it was the polling bears it out but we used to uh not call the taliban or afghan partners they re not partners they hang innocent people in the streets they are not quote our partners as they ve been described we used to believe and leave no man behind we left a lot of men and women behind in afghanistan a lot and then 13 beautiful service men and women our heroes were put in a situation they should have never been in at kabul airport and they gave their lives and they shouldn t have had to do that but they gave their lives heroically because american troops and soldiers always rise to the occasion and they certainly did and then our nation s greatest symbols are under attack um you know began with the tearing down of monuments but it ended with a church that was burning i ll never forget 10 30 p m st john s church lit a blaze i didn t believe it until i turned on the tv and saw it with my own eyes st john s church a historic beautiful little yellow church across from the white house i passed it each and every day it was built in 1815 it was called the church of the presidents because every president from james madison on down had attended a service at this historic church on top of the church is a one thousand pound bell uh made by paul revere s son well that church was lit a blaze so as i m watching this i m press secretary at the time i thought to myself what s the history behind this church i want to know a little bit more about it and here s what i found and there s irony here because these rioters who burned that church um purportedly were doing so on behalf of equal rights well here s the history of the church 1963 st john s rector was reverend john c harper he was told to shut the doors of the church why he was told that there would be a bloodbath that bloodbath uh that was the prediction ended up being the march on washington the biggest peaceful march on behalf of equal rights the one ending with reverend dr martin luther king and his beautiful i have a dream speech well this reverend at this church refused to close the doors and as the march on washington was happening he said this our family on earth are we throughout its widest span oh help us everywhere to see the brotherhood of man those were the lyrics coming from the church and when harper was asked why didn t you shut the doors of the church he said this this church building is open as it has always been to any who want to worship here the ministry of this parish is extended to any who seek it our fellowship with one another has no limitations whatsoever so the church that stood boldly on behalf of civil rights was the church that was lit ablaze purportedly by rioters seeking equal rights our nation s churches are under attack our american flag is under attack when you have a new york times editorial board member said she was disturbed to see the american flag macy gray called it tattered divisive and incorrect blm utah called it a symbol of hatred the us olympic committee apparently has plans to redesign the flag isn t that nice and then there was an alternate in the olympics who said she dreamed of getting a medal so she could stand on the podium and not put that american flag around her shoulders but so that she could burn it nation s symbols are under attack which is why we need you because look they re trying to silence you they re trying to take your voice but you cannot let them because i ll tell you this the same way my dad who by the way dad if you re listening why don t you come out here we re gonna do an instagram live my dad and my daughter baby blake my mom s here but

hate america there s no longer a question about that and yet paradoxically at the same time they desperately want to control america more than anything loving the people you lead is the most basic prerequisite of leadership we cannot let them run this nation because they hate it music music this is so funny thank you well i love you too thank you thank you guys thank you this is it s so funny i never go anywhere i literally never leave my house and i i haven t i haven t been in a room with other people oh you are too though we haven t met uh i appreciate that i m not often called sexy where i live um but thank you thank you for having me this is such a trip and and i m really grateful i m grateful to be here i never leave i never give a speech i never do anything so um when charlie asked me yeah it sounds like a pretty fun job um so i was thinking i i live on the west coast of florida and i was thinking as i was driving yeah go west coast of florida baby it really is kind of the freedom state um but i was thinking about as i do every day like what exactly is going on here in america and i m not um you know we do a show every night so i m paid to think about it but there s so much happening that it s hard sometimes to get the overview when you re caught up in all the details and people are you know texting you this outrage or this abomination and you sort of don t have a chance to pause and kind of add them all up i grew up in a world where thing i m 51 so america in my youth was really simple ideologically there was the soviet union which was left and then there were the normal people who were right and one side was for centralized control and communism and the other side was for market capitalism and freedom and christianity and you know all the good things it was left versus right and so it s with that framework that i kind of assess what s going on in the world and i began to change my mind memorial day weekend when everything started to fall apart and this group of people oh yeah this group of people kind of like all of a sudden flooded in the streets and started breaking things and so i called a bunch of friends of mine who were there covering this and i said you know who are these people i mean there was this well publicized death of somebody in minneapolis and that was the pretext but obviously there was something bigger going on here and i called a bunch of friends who were covering this and i said okay what exactly is going on why are they breaking things and setting things on fire and hurting people and he s like well these are avowed marxists and they re taking on capitalism and then allied with them is another group that hates law enforcement and they re trying to end the rule of law and i m like okay that makes sense like you know radical leftists nihilists whatever but they have an agenda they re against capitalism and they re against law enforcement okay i mean i m not you know for that but it kind of made sense so i watched this thing unfold over the over the subsequent weeks and i noticed something really weird the people who were against capitalism were destroying the smallest businesses in the country they were going after like pizza places and liquor stores and camera shops assuming any of those still exist and dry cleaners and car dealerships and i was like okay you know i guess that s capitalism but in 2020 we have bigger examples like apple and google right the richest people in the world are capitalists purportedly they re the tech monopolies and not only are they not getting their windows broken they re funding it it s like wait a second how are the anti capitalist people ignoring the actual capitalists and then i look over at the other group and they re like we re against law enforcement i m like all right well you can make the case that like not all law enforcement is great there s the biggest law enforcement agency in america it s called the fbi and i think you could make a solid case that you know they do good but they ve also you know done some things for which they should be deeply ashamed because they were abuses of power including things that i saw personally so if you re against law enforcement i suppose you re going to be calling the fbi to account for its abuses of power but no instead they went after the beat cop the guy who s paid 55 grand a year to trudge through the most dangerous neighborhoods in the country arrest criminals help old ladies get cats out of trees or whatever like do the retail end of law enforcement this is a guy who may not have a college degree who s not making any money who has precisely zero power in american society and this guy is the villain just like the random cop trust me if you intersect with american law enforcement you hope it s a random cop and not the fbi i mean he may take your beer but he s not going to tap your phone or put you in prison for the rest of your life for a thought crime but for some reason the people who were against law enforcement completely ignored this and i began to realize maybe what they re saying isn t what they actually mean maybe they re not telling the whole truth about their motives maybe the people who say they re against capitalism aren t maybe the people who say they re against law enforcement aren t maybe this is part of a larger trend where the big things are getting bigger the powerful are getting more powerful and everybody else is getting the shaft maybe what we re watching is a consolidation of power and maybe the people who have it are using these forces as their kind of shock troops in order to get what they want so if you re a huge corporation you want less competition monopoly is what you want to be and maybe they re paying for these vandals because they know in the end it ll make them more powerful this occurred to me in like june because i m slow and then i see the numbers i see that the money numbers which are always like some of the most revealing numbers but they re the ones we never talk about because somehow that s like irrelevant because every when everything is political and everything is ideological you kind of miss the obvious points which is if if you want to know who s in favor of the way things are look at who s getting richer and you see the numbers and you see that jeff bezos who has been paying for this has benefited wildly from it you think wait a second maybe there s something else going on so that s a long preamble to the following point i used to see the world in terms purely left and right and i was and will remain on the right but i m starting to think that s not exactly the way i need to understand what s happening in the world maybe it s a matter of the big versus the small the powerful versus the powerless the corporate versus the independent and that s another way to put it the good versus the bad people want to think for themselves versus the people who want to demand you think the way they tell you to think maybe that s what it s actually about so then i reassessed a lot of the things that i think are the worst about american society and i began to realize those things aren t necessarily left wing values they re corporate values so if you re running a company what do you want obedient workers you want people whose first loyalty is to you who show up on monday morning who work through the weekend who give you their all who give you their lives and in return you give them a paycheck but you give them no loyalty and no promise of long term commitment it s a it s a continuous one night stand you re just hooking up you re being used that s true contrast that with the relationship you have with the people you love your best friends your family the people with whom you have like sincere intimate personal relationships they re there for you no matter what and when you get the diagnosis or you get laid off from your job or when things turn bad when you have to wear a mask as you ride your bike or the world falls apart those are the people who are there for you those are the people you re freaking me out dude this man s whispering sweet nothings to me from the front row those are the people who care about you who actually care about you they re not the ones who are telling you oh we really care about you because of the way you look and we re on your side these are the people who are actually on your side who are going to loan your money or let you sleep on the couch or talk you through a tragedy in your own life those are the relationships that matter they re the only relationships that matter and they re almost never the relationship you have with your employer if you work for a huge company i m sorry it s just true so what you re seeing what you re seeing and you see it up and down american society is the triumph of the values of those people over the values that we hold and that made this country great and if you re wondering why american families are falling apart and if you re wondering why every directive you hear from washington divides you from your family that s why because they want your first loyalty to be to them so the question in a circumstance like this is what do you do about it how do you respond to it and the first the first thing you need to know is what s actually happening this is not you know your enemy as horrible as they are is not some crazed ideologue wearing black spray painting statues that person is loathsome and should be in jail trust me and i call for that nightly but your actual enemy is the person who s funding him and making that kind of behavior possible and is doing it for a very specific reason to tear down the past to destroy the past now why do they want to destroy the past because when you destroy the past you eliminate all reference points if you have no idea what came before you you have no idea what normal is and you cannot understand the consequences of what s happening now if you can t look to the past and understand the consequences of the same behavior in another time right the root of wisdom is knowing what happened before i mean that s the road map so when you destroy that you have an entire country that is very easily manipulated okay so the first thing to know is that s what s going on the second thing to know is that small is almost always better than big that s the truth the circle of people in your life who care enough about you to help you when things go wrong is really small there are a lot of people you re friends with on instagram or facebook or whatever in the fake digital world that we ve been lulled into participating in but the actual number of people who will take affirmative steps to help you is very very small it s not 350 million that s how many people are in this country it s not 7 billion it s like eight so your loyalty always has to be to them to your family and your closest friends above anything else period and anyone who tells you otherwise anyone who tells you that your real loyalty has got to be to some larger group of people some political group or some group of people who look like you give them the middle finger those are your enemies i m serious i m serious they are trying to destroy the fortifications that will protect you through life which are the people you love and who love you back okay so that s the first thing to know small is always bigger better be distrustful of concentrations of power they can be easily misused this is like a basic life point that we seem to have forgotten they can be easily misused and often are so if something is enormous it s a threat to you period whether it s a giant boulder you re standing under for your christmas card picture that could topple over and flatten you or whether it s google the largest and most powerful company in human history is a threat to you because it s so powerful it s a greater threat to the us government it has more power and it uses it in ways that are hidden and it is totally unaccountable to you as frustrating as the federal government can be and i spend my life raging against it at least on a theoretical level you could vote them out power from a company like google is completely resistant to your views they don t care what you think and they have no reason to care what you think okay so here s the way i think about it all the stuff is going on there s very little of it that we can actually control let s just be totally honest about that and by the way you should always keep that in mind through life you have less control than you think you do you didn t control your birth you can t add an hour to your life you just can t no one can no one s ever been able to know and ever will be able to so if you want to be wise and make clear headed decisions just remember there are a lot of things you can t control focus on the things that you can control it s like the famous neighbor quote and the thing that you can control is whether your personal life is happy productive and has inherent meaning period and no one wants to say that because it never increases their power to encourage you to have a normal happy personal life it never increases their power at all in fact it detracts from their power because you re going to wind up finding someone getting married having kids and be more loyal to them than to your political or corporate leaders and that s why they work against it in fact that is the main threat to their power and if you re wondering why big companies across the country are now offering to freeze the eggs of their female employees it s not because they re compassionate it s because they re demanding that you give them the best years of your life to serve them that you put off the thing that gives our lives meaning above all else which is passing on your genes having children that s the core meaning in life that you put that off so you can sell more widgets for them and juice the stock price and in return you get what nothing they don t know your last name but they ll freeze your eggs because we re a compassionate enlightened company yeah no because they want total control and it shows you why are the big companies so in favor of social policy that degrades the family pretending that men and women are exactly the same which they are not they are not they are very different and they need each other they need each other in order to be whole that s the truth they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle physically and spiritually for a reason which is they complement each other they need each other we need each other and anyone who tells you we don t is your enemy so the point in case this isn t clear is that what actually matters i mean i could trust me i could bore you for four hours on the intricacy of this or that policy but i was just brooding on this in the car drinking my perry i m tucker carlson for perrier it s a pause that refreshes like what actually matters what can you actually control very little and so you should focus on the things you can and you should recognize what s going on here and who s your friend and who s your enemy anyone who encourages you to think for yourself to be more imp independent minded and economically independent not just have an independent conscience and think whatever you want but be able to support yourself and your family anyone who encourages that is your friend anyone who tells you you can t live without me you need me you need to be loyal to me give me your everything that person is a false god and do not worship that person i don t care who it is it s true applause because there s a reason there s a reason for that so how do wise people live like if you re i i don t have i m not young so i can t actually see very many of you but i suspect there are a lot of people like under 30 here right charlie made that claim so if you re young and you re out of step politically and clearly you are or you wouldn t be here listening to america s most despised talk show host ramble on yeah well if you re young sorry i m sorry for the self reference i tried to avoid so like if you re young and the world is changing really fast in fact so fast that almost nobody can get a handle on where it s going or what it means it s very hard to add it all up it s very easy to isolate here are 19 shocking things that happened yesterday it s very hard to see the pattern in them and most of the people who see the patterns of them are also by the way crazy because sometimes crazy people can see the big picture but i m being dead serious by the way i always have a couple crazy people on staff because they can see things i m not joking but if you re young and like this is all happening you know i ve got kids i ve got one child in college and they re going you know and i so i sort of know what it you know means to be 21 or 18 or 25 or whatever it s like very bewildering so what should you do how should you live and so because i can t control myself because i never can here s my prescription okay the very first thing i would do and i try to do every single day is remember that it ends like the big lie in american life there are many lies but the biggest lie the one that has the deepest roots and the and the worst effects is that no one ever dies that no one ever dies it s like the one topic you can you could get up here and like tell you about my sex life not that you d be interested but i could get up here and say anything and like no one would be shocked but the one thing that is completely shocking to people is that people die like that s the verboten topic like no talking about that it s awful and even now i can see people sour faces like the death talk but it is also at the same time the one thing that s true of every living person and has always been and always will be there s an end to it it s the basic fact of life it s not just a fact it is the basic fact this play has a finale and it does tell you something about the people in charge that it s the one topic they never want to discuss are you kidding we ve got medicine for that why don t you exercise more are you joking but none of that in the end will change that unchanging fact that s called nature the people running our culture our government and our economy are fundamentally at war with nature i mean that in the broadest sense they may claim to be environmentalists none of them ever gone outside by the way none of them they can be environmentalists if they want but they are fundamentally at war with nature the basic fact of nature is that life begins it has an arc and then it ends so what does that mean for you does it mean be depressed it means face it head on and think through the implications there are many here s the most basic you don t have the time you think you do don t waste time that s the bottom line don t waste time and i mean literally not a second i ve wasted looking back on my life which i try not to do but i ve wasted like a ton of money in my life a ton i ve been out of money because i m not good money and i m not good at math okay and i ve never really regretted that i mean at certain times i ve been concerned about it but i ve never been like oh i wish i hadn t ordered you know like an extra french toast from room service because the truth is i liked you know i enjoyed it i do not regret any of that the only thing i regret in retrospect is wasting time that is a bitter pill that is tough to acknowledge i wasted time because you can t get that back that s a cliche that old people drop on you and you re like all right grandpa right life goes fast i bet when you re 80 but the truth is they re right that s the one thing that old people say that you should definitely believe if you re lucky you will be older before you think and if you re unlucky hit by a bus walking out of the convention center it s just true sorry so back up from that do not waste time so what does that mean it doesn t just mean work harder at your job it means don t delay adulthood don t delay full life the most upsetting trend from my perspective in a company full a country full of upsetting trends is this idea that i m going to get married and have kids after i m a success at work because like the people at work are gonna like help you succeed so you can get married and have kids and leave the company yeah i don t think so no they re gonna get what they can from you and maybe they re nice people maybe they re not but their interests are not the same as your interests your interest is to participate fully in human life in your life to be fully human to experience it to the maximum extent you possibly can for the time that you have that s the truth so my advice is exactly the opposite and i mean this with heartfelt sincerity you should get married as soon as you can and you should do it you should do it while you re too young and then after you get married too young you should have more kids than you can afford okay and then after you do that you should try to get a job for which you are not qualified okay you should jump face first into the pool of life i mean it i mean it put a blindfold up in fact get up on the roof i m serious get to the back of your double wide you gotta you got an above ground pool right there and just run right off the end like that that s you hitting life face first will it hurt yeah yeah but you gotta enter the pool you do and every day that you delay that you will regret trust me trust me seek meaning seek intensity meaning comes from other people i spent my whole life debating ideology and politics and i m deeply interested in it and i m deeply ideological i don t say that as a as a point of pride i say that as a confession i don t i think you can be too ideological but i think in the end and i mean literally at the end you will not look back and say you know i just wish they d lowered the marginal tax rate by six percent my life would have been a victory you re just not going to say that i don t think anyone in human history i don t think hayek said that on his deathbed maybe he did i wasn t there but the point is everything that you do now should be serving in a positive way your long term interest which may not be that long term like do it now and anything that anesthetizes you or keeps you from fully experiencing the only life that you have stop it so i mean i may totally mean that i m like the only adult who s against wheat everyone loves the weed and everyone i know smokes the weed i m sure you guys all smoke the weed i m sure you get your dab pens right now in your pockets but the reason yeah you ve got a dab pen baby no dab pen okay got it got it every time i say this at like a dinner party everyone looks at me like oh i thought you were cool oh god the anti drug guy again okay i m actually not i don t have an ideological problem with it i have a practical problem with it and anything that causes you to experience life less deeply anything that causes you to miss the amazing show going on right now in front of you is stealing from you it s stealing your life and it s not just weed that s just the beginning and i don t want to get like creepy about it or too specific but there are a lot of things that people are into now a lot of them digitally that are detractors from the intensity of life right they make it easier to pretend that everything s fine and they also make it harder to acknowledge how amazingly wonderful everything is they dull you you don t want to be dull you want at the end to say holy smokes that was ridiculous like some of it was amazing some of it was like shockingly bad like i can t believe that happened but i was there for all of it you don t want to wake up in the third act and be like what the hell just happened you know what i mean you don t want to be the guy snoring in the third row which i have done so live it experience it to the maximum possible extent that you can but always remember the measure always is how are the people around you those eight people you love most and who love you back critically and don t lie to yourself a lot of the people who are on tv and trust me i know them all who claim they really love you they don t know your last name they don t know your first name they don t love you they may agree with you they may want your help your support your ratings this is true for politicians they want your votes apple wants your money but they definitely don t love you trust me i know them so take stock of the people who do love you and focus all your attention on them because that s all we can control i look out every night every night at like five i get a cup of coffee i pad to the kitchen i get a cup of coffee then i go back to my bedroom i have a desk the dogs are there my wife s coming in and out and i start writing the script every night five nights a week and usually around 5 30 when i m like through the second paragraph i m like man things are bad i always have the same thought every night i m like boy the people who seek the destruction of the things i love my family my country my conscience the ones who are trying to get me to repeat things that i don t believe the ones who are forcing me or trying to to lie in public the ones who are getting me to dance like a monkey i m serious some of the things they ask you to do are so preposterous the only explanation is they want to see if they can make you do it no it s totally true that s what they re saying it s all about their power like i wonder if we can get the public to do this yeah can we get them you know not just wear masks and elevators fine can we get a guy who s on a kayak alone in the middle of the pacific ocean to wear a mask as if he s going to get infected by the seals can we get him do you think we can no we can t make him do that come on are you joking oh yeah we can here s what we ll do we ll arrest him when he gets back on the beach and we ll invite a news crew to film it so everyone else will know you better do exactly what they tell you to do or you re going to jail that s not and by the way i m not minimizing govid i m highlighting what s actually going on which is a legitimate tragedy leveraged for the personal power of a small group of people i mean obviously so i just every night i m sitting at my desk writing this stuff and i m like man i don t know like how many free minded people are there left actually i mean i i do think this like it s kind of dark but i m alone the dogs never say anything and i m like really can you win i mean it s not like it s not like two sides sort of facing off against each other it s like actually no no joke no exaggeration it s the most powerful people in the world all aligned i sound like a lunatic when i say this but it s measurably true the last election was a perfect example i mean the numbers tell the story you don t need to be some late night radio nut case you just read the numbers where d the money come from how much did one side have how much did the other side have who gave it it s the most powerful people in the world all on one side and i think that s terrible for the country i really believe in actual diversity where there s like a robust debate where two sides you each have a position we kind of talk it out and like you know one wins but it s a pretty fair fight that s not where we are now so i look at this and i m like oh man is it hopeless like can you actually beat google the government of china and goldman sachs i don t know you got to try you know you got to get out of bed in the morning and put your gloves on and go for it right you got to tell the truth but because by the way in the end no amount of money and no amount of praise from the world s dumb people no amount of fake awards the stupid little merit badges they give the pulitzer prize the nobel prize i ve got a rude scholarship oh shut up it doesn t mean anything i got into princeton don t be quiet no that means anything and none of that is worth betraying what you know to be true like that is that is real applause none of that i don t care how much they pay you i don t care how many of your friends on facebook think it s cool for you to repeat the lyrics to their songs when you don t believe them i don t care it is not worth it never betray your conscience and by the way you don t have to agree with me maybe you sincerely disagree with me and i have friends who do sincerely but every person i love and talk to and take seriously is a person of principle who doesn t lie about what he or she believes period period that is essential but let s say even if you do that and you are true to yourself and what you believe to your conscience and your god into the ones you love they went anyway like maybe they continue to get more powerful and maybe the pizza place doesn t come back and maybe in the end jeff bezos sells you your pizza it doesn t taste quite as good but he runs the pizza business now and everything else what if that happens the truth is you re still in charge of what goes on in your head and you re still in charge of the relationships with the people you love that is what you re in charge of so i always think to myself i always think to myself even if in the end they win and in my case you know just being honest probably not going to be treated that well if they win to put it mildly but even if i m living in a double wide trailer in a state i ve never been to in the middle of a cornfield living on social security i m still going to be living with my wife and my kids are still going to love me and i m i mean it all that matters all that matters your family that s it so i know this is a little bit harder it s a little bit easier if you re 51 and you have a job it s a little bit harder if you re not and you re 22 and you re like looking at this world and asking yourself like how do i fit in this how do i end up building a life like the ones that my parents had how do i in a world that clearly hates me and my values how do i succeed and this is something that you know i think about a lot just because i have all these kids and because you know i was a young person and like there s a lot of anxiety in the heart of every 22 year old because you gotta kind of figure out how to live in a society that you don t control and you have to prove yourself and i guess my one piece of advice would be if you can just ignore the standards that they set you don t have to participate in the society that people who hate you and your values created that s the truth i never thought i d be standing on a stage suggesting that people opt out of the popular society but that is exactly what i m suggesting i mean it i mean it if you feel i read that there was a piece in the new york post yesterday by a kid who some of my children know actually who had gone to princeton for three years he went to you know some expensive boarding school then he went to princeton he was there for three years he wrote a piece of the new york post and he s like you know the whole thing was shallow and basically it didn t learn anything i just i went there to get the merit badge of going to princeton it turns out everyone else princeton was there for the same reason they just want to work at some soulless finance company and get rich get a house in aspen and call it a day and i found that totally shallow and disgusting and it violated my values and like the whole thing was a sham like this supposedly impressive meritocracy that they created wasn t impressive at all the closer i got i realized that all these people were supposed to be really smart were actually completely banal and ordinary and we re just hoping that nobody noticed there were no original thinkers at all everyone was just a drone as he goes i moved to australia so i was like you go drop out princeton kid and then the last graph he s like but i m going back to princeton because you know got to get a princeton degree and i m like really no you don t need to go back to princeton and by the way you don t need to go to princeton either if you believe the system is kind of a joke then don t participate in it i mean that applause and what s going to happen is this is another reason that no one my age ever wants to have dinner with me because i always say this at the table and they re all deeply offended but the truth is that the entire american upper middle class or professional class is completely vested in these symbols of attainment of achievement which don t actually connote real attainment or achievement in other words going to princeton doesn t make you smart it doesn t mean you learned anything it just meant you follow the rules the very narrow specific rules designed to make you a perfect bank employee and maybe that s what you want to be and if you want to work at goldman go ahead and go to princeton and that s awesome and invite me to ski and aspen next year great but let s say you don t want that don t participate in it well the problem is that when people start saying that it really offends their parents because and i ll tell you exactly why not because most parents believe their kids are learning anything in college because they know they re not but because i mean let s be honest hayden s a duke just you know what i mean that s like the kind of thing that every parent wants to say at a cocktail party yeah hayden s a duke he s on the lacrosse team i mean you know got a kind of perfect score in the sat i mean he s pretty bright i ll be honest like maybe you have to be 50 to know what that means but trust me that s the goal of everybody my age is to be like hayden s a duke you know he you know he got into pen but we just felt like duke was was better there s no reference at all to what hayden is learning at duke by the way nothing not one thing and instead is like being taught to hate america hate his parents hate the system that made duke possible and no one wants to admit it so clearly this whole system has run its course so it s very easy to say that to be like oh the system is stupid and and we need to fix it and higher education should be impressive and it was with the gi bill and we trained generations of americans to you know be more productive and happier and better compensated than their parents that s all true but at a certain point when we all know this and those of you are in college already know it very well you re living it at a certain point it got completely subverted by bad people and the rest of us who are the ones who send the money in to keep this whole ludicrous operation moving like refuse to acknowledge it and we re like we just want hayden to get into duke let s just be clear you know what it means we can tell our friends and we allowed it to continue and the truth is and you know this there s no fixing it no if you want to be a veterinarian or an engineer or whatever there are all kinds of you know higher education paths that are necessary i mean if you re gonna you know drill my bicuspids i want you to go to dental school i m not you know i m not against education but the liberal arts conventional i want a communications degree from penn state no you don t i m sorry you don t you don t and it will be worth nothing you re going to be deeply indebted and there s a very good chance that it will hurt you is the truth that it will hurt you and this is the last thing i ll say but so i ve thought this for a long time no one i know my age agrees with me they think i m crazy for saying this so i had one of my kids had a friend who was very very bright i always thought he was bright in high school kids really smart and but a little weird but smart and very smart and so this i said to them right before they graduated high school i was like do you you know plan to go to college well yeah of course you know that s what you do in america you go to college like what you didn t go to college and i said all right you know have fun or whatever so like two months later my son calls me and it s like you know he s not doing that well in college i was like well of course he s not doing well in college he s like an original free thinker they hate that that s like the last thing you can be in college someone with unauthorized opinions who dares say them out loud like not allowed and so i called the kid and i was like how s college well i don t really like it and i was like you know you ve been there for three months or whatever you should drop out and come work for me and he s like well i m only 18 i was like i don t care and so he did now i m not gonna he probably will see this and i m deeply embarrassed but the truth is that was five years ago he still works for me and no i m just saying like he turned out to be you know one of the best people that we had now the truth is the job that i put him in was perfectly suited for his natural ability which is really important and no one ever says that either one of the big lies of higher education is you can like go to school and learn to do something that you have no basic aptitude in that s a total lie you could send me to 20 years of mit i would never understand physics i just wouldn t i can t do math i m dyslexic done do the thing for which you re naturally suited pay attention to who you are do the thing that you are naturally good at that you love without being prompted that you would do for free that s totally true don t lie to yourself the biggest lie is oh well you can be whatever you want to be what no you can t you can take the skills that god gave you and you can use them to maximum effect that s true so anyway this kid and i probably shouldn t even be saying this because unfortunately it s 100 true but this kid had the skills required for the job that we put him in and he s turned out to be like an utter star and he s 24 married and and has like you know four years of work experience that no one his age has he ran with it so you can t tell me there s a school in the world that for the price will give you the benefit of four years of being in the right job now you have to find someone who s going to hire a high school graduate who you know drinks a lot and you have to find a job that suits you but if you can you should just because they do it this way doesn t mean you need to keep doing it this way and just because they require you to violate your most deepest your deepest held beliefs the things that you really care about your loyalty to your family to your faith just because they require you to violate all of that doesn t mean you have to you do not have to and you should not and i don t care how many guidance counselors tell you well you got to do this no i don t no i don t the only way we re going to live in a free country is if the people who live in the country act like it s a free country music that s the truth it is the truth and no one you vote for can make it a free country what a lie that is and i like some politic not very many but i know them all that s for sure i mean i ve lived in dc for 35 years and some are better than others and a few were pretty good like you d have dinner with them very few but all of them tell you if you vote for me you ll be freer and happier and that s a complete lie that s a complete lie only you can be free and make yourself free and the only way you do that is by living as a free person period and if you have to take less money or move to some place you ve never been before in order to do that you should do that don t play along i m sure i m going to wreck the light probably like three people in this audience were like yeah i m gonna do that it s a huge risk to do that i hope there are more than three because i really really mean it the old systems are going away don t play along anyway sorry now i m rambling and i m out of time but i i no because my thoughts are so okay okay hold on this guy where s the where s the weird kid has been heckling me do you have a question didn t you guys have a que i ll take one question yes that our country so thank you for that so let me um i ll repeat the question which is basically they re telling you to be quiet there s an enormous amount of pressure on you to conform how do you how do you speak in a world like that and i would say i think if that s a fair summation and i would say i m in a very fortunate place because i m paid to talk so it doesn t take a great deal of bravery when you have a tv show to say what you think because like that s the job and it s amazing how many people are afraid to just do the basic job like if you have a contract to the tv network and you re lying why are you doing that you re under contract you see whatever you want and you should you should say exactly what you think period like again back to the life is short thing like it s life is way too short to pretend you think something you don t like what s the advantage in that sucking up to the mob and being like oh really i m on your side spare me they re going to eat you in the end anyway be a man tell the truth so but how did but that s but that s that s very easy i mean i ll just say like that s it s a pretty low risk proposition for me i m just being totally honest about it like it s not it doesn t take a lot of bravery for me to do that because that s what i m supposed to be doing and i m so grateful for it it takes a lot of bravery if you re a young person in a system controlled by people who hate you and demand obedience to speak up against them it really really does it takes it takes too much and people can t do it and i understand why and i hope i d be brave enough to do it but i don t know because i m not a kid in 2020 and i m so grateful that i m not but i would say this if you you know if you want to change things if you really want to change things that s honestly what it takes it does it doesn t take violence it doesn t even take voting most of the time we don t get to vote that much once every two years mostly what it really takes is just small acts of personal courage and conviction like no i m not i m sorry i m not going along with that i don t need to get in your face i don t need to give you something long i mean i talk to people all the time like well i would speak up but i m not you know i don t know the issues very well or i m not super articulate fine i mean that s okay but it doesn t take some long soliloquy you d have to stand on a desk and be like you know four score and seven years ago you don t have to do that often it s enough of like no i can t do that i m sorry i just don t believe that and i m not gonna pretend that i do you know that s all that s all it takes and you don t need to be confrontational about it you don t need to be a jerk or be loud i mean some of the most powerful examples through history which i know you re very familiar with have been quiet people who just refuse to obey at a certain point because it s too much that was certainly true in the early church it was true the best parts of the civil rights movement it s always been true like the people with deep moral courage don t need to call too much attention to themselves they just need to stop obeying and so i would i would recommend that to everybody but i also recognize the costs are very real and again it s easy for a guy with a job contract to give that advice it s like whoa no you know you go first and so that s kind of what i was getting at in a not very articulate way when i said well maybe you need to opt out and go do your own thing i mean honestly i think it s worth it if you look ahead in your life and you decide what i really want to have is a stable family and that s the only thing that s worth having in my opinion i know a lot of rich people a lot and i ve never met one who s like you know i really got happy when i got rich like it really brought joy to my i ve never met one person who said that better than being poor being poor will make you unhappy there s no doubt about that i m not sort of romanticizing poverty but i know for a fact that getting rich will not it won t ring your bell i m sorry it just won t and no person who s ever gotten rich will ever tell you otherwise not one person so the only thing that makes you happy is a happy family that s it and that s just true this is not you know christian evangelism it s just like fact based social science and so if you really believe that then you need to work toward that goal without being distracted by it any other thing that gets in your way like anything that prevents me from at the end of the day having a happy family and like kids who love me and a spouse who loves me like who doesn t want that everybody wants that and we live in a world where it s like no it s kind of embarrassing to raise your own kids like what you re not what do you do you re not working if you actually talk to people in their surveys and it s like what do people really want they kind of want to raise their own kids actually they don t want to hire someone from a far away country do they want to raise their own kids like why is that you know that s like the most natural thing there is like why wouldn t they want that and guess who doesn t want you to raise your own kids the people who are living off of your labor the people who think you should be at work making widgets to help the stock price like they re not why they don t care about your kids by the way their spouses are home raising their kids because they can afford they can do whatever they want but they don t want you to oh i get it you re working against the happiness of my family and the future of my children so you re my enemy actually you re my and how else do you describe that you re my enemy you re working to hurt my family you re making it impossible for me to raise my own children i mean what does it take that s like that s like a spiritual home invasion that s like such an act of hostility nothing else comes close to that calling me mean names i don t care keeping me from raising my own kids like that s a basic violation there s nothing more basic than that so if you really believe that then you should just take out all the stops and just try and live it i mean it and you ll win in the end thank you for having me music

debate a show for political eclectics i m robbie gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlot well a lot happening in the world today it s just like too much stuff going on way too much the us is on high alert for potential russian cyber attacks as moscow looks to retaliate against crushing sanctions a guest speaker at uc hastings law school gets his speech drowned out by a sea of protesters why was this guest not welcome you guessed it an issue involving race and speaking of race fort lauderdale is racing to the bottom they are down a police chief but they might be up a college basketball referee but first things first let s talk about energy let s talk about oil as of this morning the national average for a gallon of gasoline is at its highest in history 417 and that makes today s announcement that the u s is going to impose a ban on russian oil a tricky proposal we re banning all imports of russian oil and gas and energy that means russian oil will no longer be acceptable at u s ports and the american people will deal another powerful blow to putin s war machine now over in europe some countries are so dependent on russian energy they re not willing to go there but the white house is willing to go it along despite these surges we re seeing at the pump so ravi what is your read on all of this well the highest gas prices that we ve had in recent memory were 2008 and we re actually slightly below that in in inflation adjusted terms so we re still not there yet but i i m confident we ll probably get there very soon based on what s been happening this week and i think people may be confused because we ve been told that the us is uh self sufficient uh with for energy since 2019 that we re energy independent but just because we produce enough domestically doesn t mean that we don t import oil because we re actually exporting uh oil in certain cases uh while bringing some in and i think one of the weird reasons for this is the market economics most of our refineries are in the gulf coast and we re sending a lot of that abroad just because i guess it s it just makes sense for these companies they they re able to trade at a higher at a higher um per barrel amount and then we re bringing in oil including from russia in our coasts uh and the east and west coast and so we take three percent of our crude oil comes from russia which is not that much but the refined oil which is what you put in your car is 21 uh in part because of those refineries and the gulf coast are sending so much abroad so we are dependent on russia in a way and so this is going to make a huge difference so it s already sending a price shock around the world and obviously this is this touched off a huge debate domestically about biden and whether he s doing enough yeah so obviously biden has gotten a lot of criticism for his expressed policies or desire to uh kind of pull back on a lot of our oil productions and pipelines and stuff but i think that there is admittedly some misplaced blame um even though he came in with like a hardline stance against any further oil expansion and signed a federal or executive order almost immediately upon assuming office that would prevent any new federal oil drilling on government lands that ultimately was shut down by the court and in the end did not come to fruition so i think that there definitely is misplaced blame but there also was a legitimate expressed interest in on his part to um kind of pull back our production so i m glad that the court blocked it obviously because we never would have expected to be in a situation like this but this goes to show that you know as much as as we do care about the environment domestically there are really important and intertwined international issues that play here as well yeah and as part of that you know biden has actually outpaced trump in issuing drilling permits on public lands there and there are 9 000 approved oil leases that oil companies are not currently tapping right now and in part what s going on is we had this weird situation in the middle of a pandemic where oil was trading at a negative value meaning it was more expensive to hold oil to store to store it um than its actual value was at that time and that s because nobody was going anywhere and there s only so much capacity to store oil in this country and uh there s this entity called the american petroleum institute which is essentially the lobbying arm of uh big oil and they came after biden recently saying you know ukraine s essentially his fault uh and in part what they pointed to ricky was what you talked about which was his intention early in the administration which was uh at least when it comes to federal land which is you know largely what he can control he could control federal land he could control uh domestic stockpiles strategic reserves which he s released he was releasing some of this before any of this um they went after him saying this was essentially your fault which i find really interesting because this is a an entity that has been lobbying against any sanctions on russia continuously going back to crimea going back to the interfere interference in our election going all the way recently to january when russia was amassing troops on our border the american petroleum institute was cautioning congress not to be rash in part because a lot of these oil companies have had strong relationships with russia now to their uh credit some of them like exxon have pulled back recently but only when it became untenable for them and so uh this is you know to me i m frustrated with oil companies i m not one of those people who who thinks that like oil companies are the only big bad that we have on issues of climate change but it is frustrating this is an entity that has fought the u s response every step of the way and there s tons of evidence that oil companies are actually slowing production or at least dragging their feet on increased production because they re getting record windfalls like the scarcity is actually to their benefit yeah there is this narrative and a lot of people where i come from in alabama are really pushing this narrative that joe biden is somehow solely responsible for these high gas prices that the government is somehow solely responsible for these high gas prices and based off all the things that we just said that s just not true i mean the oil they re producing in the gulf for instance two thirds of that gets exported overseas you know not to mention there s a difference in the type of oil that we can collect here in america versus the type of oil that is more usable for instance west coast refineries rely heavily on what the this russian type of oil called light sweet crude which is just an awesome name it sounds like a soda or something that i would drink and this is a oil that s easier to refine and easier to turn into gasoline for us whereas some of the heavier crews like for instance the keystone pipeline that everybody talks about that bite and shut down it would have given us this uh heavier crude called heavy tar sands oil which is just much worse for the environment and harder to refine so that that s a big part of this too but when we talk just on that before you move on just keep in mind when i said about the refineries too right uh if we re only getting three percent of our imports from russia on the crude on the crude oil then the keystone pipeline really isn t going to make much of a difference on this front it s the refined oil that s really the the difference maker when it comes to russia and that s what we re getting about 21 yeah from russia yeah that s a big thing so speaking of russia um ricky so we re about to shut down importation of oil from russia but that s pretty much a no go for europe why is that yeah it sounds like we re likely to stand alone um there were some talks that maybe japan might follow suit but in terms of europe and the eu that doesn t sound like any sort of sanctions on oil or energy coming from russia is going to happen uh 41 of the eu s natural gas is imported from russia 27 percent of crude oil uh 46 7 percent of coal and even though the eu climate chief the european commission president they have all been pushing um energy independence uh even seven years ago i was listening to a video of the eu climate chief saying we need to be independent from russia um it s clear that that never came to fruition and we re really seeing the consequences of that now zelensky um is calling for bans on russian uh energy imports instead some would call it an embargo others would call it morality when you reject giving money to a terrorist and so it sounds like that s not going to happen though because the eu requires a unanimous vote of the 27 countries within it and especially germany is not going to do that because they are enormously dependent on russian energy they are the largest economy they re the largest importer of russian crude oil um and they ve kind of had like a um a change through trade idea that if if goods are crossing the border then tanks won t and that doesn t really seem to have come to fruition um they re pushing back on all the plans to sanction russian oil especially because it s still cold there and they really needed to heat people s homes and luckily you know this didn t happen in earlier in the winter when there s more time that we might have like a potential real huge need in germany for for oil to heat homes but um the winter and how that and how long this progresses will ultimately play a huge role ricky correct if i m wrong they dragged germany um which i think as you mentioned is that the largest economy in the eu right they they drag their feet on nuclear right yeah they um they shut down a ton of nuclear plants and their and their dependence is huge but they ve kind of changed their tune a little bit they ve been criticized also for keeping a very small portion of their gdp and putting it into defense and they ve kind of they ve decided to um change their tune and and promote uh domestic oil production and energy production as well as increase their defense expenditure but it seems like it s a little late for that yeah it s not the kind of stuff that s going to show fruit overnight no well there s a historical reason why germany would not want to put a lot of money into their military now um as far as we re concerned here in america with us shutting off which i mean biden as we speak is announcing that we re pretty much going to stop importing or from russia for the time being the question then becomes well who replaces that and there s been a lot of talks about saudi arabia uh white house press secretary jen sackey would not confirm this past monday if uh biden was going to go to saudi arabia but there is talks of that a trip to saudi arabia to ask for increased oil production would be a hat in hand trip for president biden who promised the nation that saudi arabia would pay for the slaying of khashoggi we all remember when that particular incident happened you re referring to a a journalist a journalist and and i m not sure he was either a washington post journalist and he wasn t he you know he died in mysterious circumstances that seemed allegedly the saudi incredibly allegedly uh defeat of very powerful people in saudi arabia yes yes yes so there s a lot of criticism on both sides here um representative omar has criticized u s talks in with saudi arabia in light of what s going on in yemen uh while marco rubio on the other side of the aisle has also criticized handing our oil production off to authoritarian countries so it s kind of like a zero sum game a no win game here for biden and i think people are overselling saudi arabia here because russia puts out 4 5 million barrels per day in crude exports and 2 5 million barrels per day other oil product exports so put that number together at seven uh million barrels per day right and there s an analyst at goldman sachs who pointed out that basically the magnitude of russia s exports are you saudi arabia will barely make a dent in this and that you know saudi arabia at best can add 1 million to that number uh on a daily basis and that opec as a whole can add 2 million so that s just a small part of this puzzle here so you know let s say we get opec and saudi arabia to add that 2 million every day which is it s a tough sell right and involves a lot of trade offs like who knows what saudi arabia is going to be asking in return yeah and these aren t always the most transparent conversations right so you ve got that and there s tons of reasons to think that opec won t go along with this yeah ties between some of the other opec countries and russia for example but yeah and biden s been critical of some of these countries so then you gotta you can then you gotta go to venezuela iran um we ve got to make uh you know trade offs domestically right where as we ve talked about we re already you know biden put for sale a huge part of the gulf um for for drilling i think was one of the largest sales um for oil exploration and history like we re already making tons of trade offs so this is kind of a scary world just thinking about how do we even get to that seven million barrels per day now we might not need to get to seven um because people aren t following us but like let s say this war escalates and that they do have to follow us then we re in real trouble and this is on top of the fact that there s already kind of a silent embargo going on like there some people are putting the number to two to 2 5 million barrels per day that russia isn t exporting just because of the private sector boycotts that are happening in russia so this is tricky well that s not the only thing that s scary and that s not the only thing really threatening us when it comes to russia and the the possibilities of things that they could do to us while russia threatens spiking energy prices they ve got another slightly nerdier weapon too cyber attacks we know moscow has serious capabilities when it comes to this and we also know that the u s does not exactly have an impenetrable defense when it comes to this now the department of homeland security has warned that russian cyber attacks could be imminent and that quote every organization in the united states is at risk so ravi how concerned should the average american be about cyber tax and how prepared are we to handle them yeah i think you know all aspects of our government and private sector are bracing themselves for cyber attacks from russia and obviously russia has a huge history here and some people like senator mark warner in the senate have talked about potentially us going further and that we have an obligation to our nato allies that if they re attacked in a cyber attack that maybe will uh invoke uh nato s article five like so collective defense so world war iii you know so this is this is you know at least to my knowledge one of the first times this has been you know cyber warfare has been thrown in with uh article five outside of you know esoteric security conferences and this comes as uh there was a really illuminating uh opinion piece in the new york times recently by glenn gertzel who s the former former general counsel of the national security agency is one of the agencies that is really you know involved is heavily involved in probably our offensive and defensive uh cyber warfare and he said that the us is vulnerable when it comes to cyber attacks and he particularly points to the fact that we don t have a centralized uh entity within our government that s tasked with uh our cyber defense and cyber offense and um he did point to the fact that biden has consolidated coordination within the department of homeland security but he pointed out all sorts of problems with the way that this is configured like the lack of authority the dhs has to push private sector actors to do the right thing um the lack of um um you know turf over like the vast array of the types of policies that are happening and essentially what it boils down to is one cyber attack on say our transportation infrastructure uh is probably going to rhyme with an attack or use similar capabilities on something else within our government like let s say our energy infrastructure for example and the fact that we have different agencies tasked with handling these different responses and they have limited ability to push the private sector to do certain things given the the nature and the importance of some of these uh pieces of infrastructure that we re in uh we re potentially in a world of trouble here and and something could be coming very soon that could just add to the chaos that we re seeing uh wow yeah it s insane yeah and there s definitely a ton of different fronts not just like the commercial the financial the infrastructural the governmental um issues here but also the personal data risks as well and it s coming from all fronts kind of at the same time we don t know what angle russia might potentially try to hit us at um but it s also worth saying that according to the international institute for strategic success we re the form of cyber super power so even though we might not have the best defenses necessarily we are kind of strongest um in the sense of our infrastructure digitally so yeah a little bit of there is a history here on the offense front which is like i guess it s cold comfort because it s like i guess i i want us to have good offense but i really really want us to have good defense you know our history on offense is pretty significant here we had the stuxnet in 2010 we basically shut down a nuclear reactor in iran and a lot of people say it was one of the most sophisticated cyber attacks in history in 2019 um there was an attack on a russian electrical grid that you know there allegedly came from people from u s cyber command so we have our history of offense russia has their history of offense in 2017 um they used a cyber weapon called not pettya which wired called the most devastating cyber attack in history and it started in ukraine but then rapidly spread throughout the private sector across the world and so this is this sucks like you know you have two you know major powers uh you know launching you know unprecedented cyber attacks on each other that are rippling across our economy and harvard they have this center called the belfor center and they issued a report on our cyber defense and this is what they said they said to say that the us is not prepared for a cyber 911 is an understatement and employs the wrong analogy this country and its people its businesses and his government are already under attack yeah that s that s insane i mean good offense is nothing without a good defense everybody knows defenses win champions the bills know this from from our playoff history yeah yeah i m sure they do you know there was a solar winds attack that occurred back in 2020 in which they were basically hacking the state department the pentagon we all remember the colonial pipeline attack from last year that basically shut down a pipeline in houston and it caused a lot of gas stations in the southeastern united states to uh you know basically for their prices to go up so this is something that could really affect just the average person and i think we definitely you know government s got to get their __ together they got to consolidate this because right now there s approximately 80 different committees and subcommittees that claim jurisdiction over various aspects of cyber regulation that s way too many hands in the pot yeah there s and there s a lot you know russia is not only home to a lot of this sort of institutional cyber warfare but it s also home to a lot of you know individual players and so you know there s that problem of hey the big uh corporation or the government entity getting hacked uh and then there s the problem of like my dad responding to like a random email that steals his financial information and his identity and there s a lot of reason to believe that both those problems uh overlap with russia pretty significantly you know the unfortunate reality of how we live right now is we need russia to crack down uh you know it s it s hard to ask them to stop the institutional stuff because that s like in their interest and that s that has to do with global diplomacy but you want them to crack crack down on the the you know the the small time entrepreneurs because at least in in that case you can imagine like they have less of an interest in allowing that stuff to flourish within their borders and and i i m not sure we re going to see uh we re not gonna see like a pretty um vigorous reaction from russia moving forward on this stuff yeah well tell your dad to stop opening those emails i mean there s no nigerian prince that s gonna that s gonna refund him that money let s move on a panel event at uc hastings law school went completely haywire last week after a group of law students shouted down a guest speaker named ilya shapiro he was supposed to talk about the supreme court confirmation process but he caught so much flack from students over an earlier tweet about potential candidates for the supreme court a tweet that the students called racist that he was drowned out at this event by protests now ricky you are the uh free speech person on our panel here uh walk us through this yes so this starts um back in the end of january with um ilya shapiro is a cato institute scholar some more on the libertarian end um than the conservative end necessarily um and he was appointed to be the executive director of georgetown center for the constitution and then um a week after his appointment he made this tweet during biden s appointment to the supreme court kind of speaking out against using immutable characteristics as a litmus test for who he would appoint suggested that this indian american judge should become the appointee varian artfully worded and he used the phrase lesser black woman in the tweet he later apologized for and he said that he did not mean to cause offense but obviously that phrase in this context is is hard to swallow for a lot of people and so this ended up with a um a huge sit in at georgetown people demanding reparations demanding uh like areas to cry on campus and just a meltdown on georgetown s campus demands to fire him in the end georgetown put him on a paid administrative leave with a pending investigation that s still in place and then now he went to uc hastings and he was shouted down pretty vigorously banging on tables just completely could not say anything for the entire hour the students that were there to listen to him could not hear him speak music oh the professor that was there to oppose him actually said to one of the protesters that he supported the protests and it s important to make the delineation that no matter what he said this is not a defense of what he said this is a defense of academic freedom and you know you have to support what you agree with and what you disagree with and certainly this was an inartful phrase that he used but in the end shouting down speakers is never the answer that s not how free speech works especially in a public institution like uc hastings and luckily the school condemned that in the end but it s not a good look for our future lawyers and something like 200 plus uh professors at georgetown came to his defense yes yeah even nicole hannah jones uh said there was nothing to investigate with his ongoing investigation at georgetown there s also you know georgetown has a little bit of a hypocrisy problem here too because there s this other professor in 2018 i think her name is carol christine fair and she tweeted the following in reference to republican senators who supported brett kavanaugh she tweeted look at this course of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist arrogated entitlement all of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps bonus we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine yes now any guess as to what happened to her what did georgetown do did you get a promotion nothing they defended her saying this is her speech she s entitled to say it uh and that to me is problematic because it s saying this is a this is a clearly liberal person saying crazy __ uh now she should be able to say that i don t think she should be fired for that i certainly wouldn t want to take her class but like she s entitled to say that but i think what you re seeing is a double standard where you have as you described ilia shapiro who is a known conservative who says something objectionable and is put on administrative leave now who even knows what what s going to be said there so it s like oh what s going to happen there right like what happens to him is it even tenable for him to remain on campus after this so that to me is the problem not what he originally said yeah uh and there s some really smart stuff out there there s you know i john quarter wrote an interesting piece where he said basically i really hate what this guy said but there are multiple interpretations of it and i generally come out um were recorders but i think even if you don t come out where john recorder is on that like this double standard is ridiculous yeah the double standard aspect is pretty ridiculous definitely so i m a fellow at the foundation for individual rights and education and they came out with a statement after this about why shouting down a protester is never the answer or shouting down a speaker is never the answer that s not a valid means of protest that s that s using your speech to obstruct someone else s speech but there are tons of other things that you can do you can turn your back on a speaker you can hold signs you can ask questions you can write an article about how much you hate them before after they come onto campus you can hold a competing event at the same time to draw people away from it there s a million things that you can do but ultimately our future lawyers in this country especially you know at georgetown which is a really prestigious law school it s concerning to see people who feel like they can t listen to or tolerate or feel comfortable in themselves when they hear distressing or potentially offensive things because law can be extremely distressing and extremely disturbing and they re going to have to be in courtrooms you know litigating very intense like potentially violent crimes and so you know these are our future leaders and we need to make sure that you can you can vigorously oppose speech but shouting it down or insulating yourself from from viewpoints that you don t like is never the answer especially at somewhere like georgetown or uc hastings yeah well i mean based off of the tweet the guy definitely doesn t get a lot of points from me but i do totally agree that he shouldn t be fired and as for the __ shouting down speech thing i also agree with that it s not smart to uh shout down speech whether you re at law school or whether you re during the state of the union um yeah um so let s move on the city of fort lauderdale has fired its police chief larry scarado over complaints of discrimination in his promotion process but this was a case of discrimination we rarely hear about an investigation found that the police chief unfairly focused on minority candidates while hiring now he s only been on the job since august but it certainly appears like he never won over the department when multiple senior staffers turned on him in an investigation into his hiring practices on the bright side the former top cop does moonlight as a college basketball ref so he s got another gig in uniform to fall back on but in all seriousness um what is going on in fort lauderdale well let me tell you what s going on this police chief larry scarado who s actually the first openly gay chief hired in fort lauderdale and uh he is of mixed race background now he took this chief position after being a former uh assistant chief in pittsburgh where he served for 23 years and basically he was given the one of his first things when he was a police chief was he was supposed to promote someone to a higher position i believe he was a captain position if i m not uh if i m not incorrect about that and he had a bunch of senior staffers in the police department help him make this choice the senior staffers decided that there was an individual lieutenant charlie stutters a white male with 20 years on the job that they all agreed this was demand for this job and scorado said not charlie he said it s going to be between these two and he pointed out two other police officers that he wanted to give the job to and apparently when he was trying to choose between these two other candidates he said which one is blacker and i i guess saying that he was going to give the position to whoever was the the blackest of the two uh one witness reportedly said that minority status is not related to the darkness of the pigment of their skin and you can t choose someone based on their skin color like that to which the chief replied well which one would be more acceptable to the community or is this an accurate reflection of the community so it sounds like he was trying to be you know inclusive but he was just going about it the wrong way i think where he finally wound up in that exchange to the extent that we we rely upon that transcript is is probably where he should have started which is like we need to reflect the community right and i think by the data the police force has some work to do to better reflect the diversity of the community especially given the history of policing issues in the african american community like all laudable important goals right now he just seems really sloppy about how he went about this process and you know your job as a leader of that police department is to build support for your policies and when you can t get that support is to hold people accountable to carry them out and it seems like he just seems like he didn t have like you know his feet on the ground when it comes to just like basic 101 in organizational change here yeah and there s another um allegation that came out out of this investigation where he was standing in front of a wall of like framed photos of uh heads of the office or or high up uh officers and said that wall is too white i m gonna change that in front of people which um which offended a lot of the people that testified against him there were 21 witnesses that all seemed to have unanimously agreed that he s made promotions based on race in their opinion um and they re alleging that the equal employment opportunity commission uh regulations are violated um if th if that s really the metric that he s ultimately using in the end for to choose his promotions but he denies the uh which is blacker comment and also um only six out of his 15 promotions that he s made have been people of like uh minority classes and so you know there s there s both sides to this story here but um ultimately it seems like this allegation um and this investigation was pretty conclusive and he lost his job for it so this is a tricky one for me because on the one hand i don t think you should be looking at candidates based solely off of their race it should be about you know way more than that it should be about what they re capable of but at the same time if you are hired to change the nature of a police department in this time period where things are so tense between the black community and police departments and you like for instance if you looked at a wall of pictures of people who were leaders of the police department he said oh this wall s too white well that s a very off color uh statement uh literally but the the thing is if he really does feel that the police department is not a reflection of the environment that they re policing what s wrong with trying to change that yeah but i think part my feeling is part of changing that also means uh doing everything possible to bring everybody else along now if they still don t come along with you in my opinion then it s on them but it doesn t sound to me like he did enough to convince the people in this department that his criteria were sound and there was this one exchange between him and a guy who was passed up this guy i love the names involved here by the way this is the name malushi right so um melushi goes up to how do we say his name scarado scoroto um and mushi is upset because he was passed up for some job right and he goes up to scrota at this reception and this is a coin in the transcript from this report he goes so you re you re promoting a guy with an internal affairs investigation kicked out of special events ia and scored a write replies that s just where we re at and then malushi goes back i m senior to both an overall time and rank and then scrota replies again that s just where we re at and then melushi goes on to say i thought you were hired to change things there was a culture where there was patronage yada yada yada and then apparently according to some other witness uh the scroto guy walks away from this exchange and goes who s this melushi guy i want to punch him in the face so i don t i don t know what to make of this but like it sounds to me like this guy like if he s gonna be pushing this this police department to reform which is admirable and i do think police departments should reflect the communities they serve uh you ve got to be you know better at this like you can t be so sensitive to people pushing back against your policies you have to take the time be patient explain it to them come up with criteria that you re honest about implement those criteria with fidelity take feedback even if you disagree with the feedback respect the people giving it to you so if this guy is right that this other person had an internal affairs investigation and if that guy is right that there was a history of patronage and issues you need to take the time to be like look this is why this is different this is why that internal affairs investigation uh you know we wound up you know looking past it because nothing came like just spend the time to bring people along you know what i m saying yeah and also people who have been looked over for jobs are never gonna you know speak highly of the person that looked them over for a job so you have to take everything that these individuals are saying with a grain of salt but my question is what do you do then to change that culture because i think he was being way too obvious and transparent with what he was doing and i think he was not doing it i think he was doing it possibly in good faith i m not sure but he wasn t being smart about it um but well you know my i always say this like when we re talking about the supreme court it s like okay well we don t want to choose somebody just because of their race and gender but there s never been a person of this race in general on the supreme court so it s like how else do we get there what what i want to know what the process for getting there is if we don t if we want to just look past someone s immutable characteristics okay how else do we change you know the makeup of these things you know what i think is missing and i don t know um what his policy has been on this but in terms of this report this is about promotion of people that are already in the force and making sure that they re being treated fairly just based on their qualifications but i think that there s definitely an argument to be made about the recruitment process and making sure that we re recruiting from communities that reflect the people who they ultimately will serve and so i think that you know that s one way that you can if you want to make these sort of changes that he was trying to make uh implement that without being offensive to anyone that s already in the force and i mean i i m not gonna make any statement on whether or not i think he was right and doing what he was doing but that s certainly a better way of going about it to say you know let s go and recruit let s go actually reach out to the communities let s let s get new blood into the force that can ultimately be promoted through these channels and not necessarily overlook someone uh regardless of their qualifications based on an immutable characteristic yeah and i think this is tricky i i think you asked the right question which how do you go about this and like you know as i ve previously described my my position on the supreme court stuff is just straight up incoherent so i won t revisit that now because i do think you need to make these changes i think yeah my biggest issue with him is how he communicated and brought people along but i also think there are certain steps you could take along the way right and i don t know these people he picked i don t know if this is the right person you don t have anything because you know what some of these people are saying that oh i i was i was on the job longer i had seniority well that doesn t mean anything yeah you could have been on the job longer and not done as good of a job so we really ultimately don t know they were both tenure and testing metrics that they were talking about in the report um and particularly the one guy with 20 years tenure at the second highest testing metric as well i m not sure what those testing metrics were but those were internal to the force yeah so that s what it means you got to design new criteria right now union rules may prohibit this but maybe you get a panel of people from the community to participate in the interview process right so people who are affected by this right and you know maybe that that in some ways it also takes it out of your hands a little bit so you can able to say all right now we ve like agreed on this thing and yada yada and you one one way he could have gone about this is is one step at a time to be like all right we want to right we do want a police force that represents the community right yes we want a police force that understands the community right because we re pleasing yes all right trail of yes is now so because of that we need to have uh you know we need to bring the community in on this process a little bit yeah that is a hard yes but let s say you get that yes keep going right and then in the end people agree to the process they could still they still can and will have issues with it but they ll have less to hang around your neck you re less likely to lose your job in that scenario and i get it when he looks at that wall and says it s too white like he s probably right uh but the thing is like if you re if your job is to bring along this police department and effectively manage it being right isn t the only criteria for what it means to be effective at that job because now he s right and without a freaking job so that doesn t help anybody and being right you know he can t just look at those individuals and say oh they re white so they re problematic right like you know he doesn t know i mean he s coming into this police department so he doesn t know the individual backstories of all these rights judging them for their skin color is no different from you know what s what s going on in this country for you know hundreds of years but again i understand the sentiment and there was also probably a lot of political pressure to do this because the guy before him was demoted because he defended his officers shooting rubber bullets of peaceful protesters in the light of george ford and so there was probably a lot of political pressure on him to do this and maybe that s the reason why he was going about it in such a poor manner um but yeah i i totally do agree that it should have been done a lot a lot more carefully and you know maybe with some community uh input that definitely does sound like it would have been a better way to go uh but we want to end things with doing a little bit of update we talked a little bit about tick tock and how it was being used to show things that were going on with the war in ukraine and how there was a lot of people getting uh banned from tick tock getting their accounts taken down because they were showing things to ukraine uh me particularly was was banned from tock now tick tock has restored me so i m not going to bat mouth them as much as i was going to but there seems to have been an update here so after russia banned both facebook and twitter tick tock announced that it would block live streaming and uploading of new content in russia amid the kremlin s new law that any fake news that goes against the russian narrative when it comes to this war in ukraine is basically punishable by law you can get up to 15 years in prison in russia now if you broadcast any news that they say goes against um you know their reason for that particular war now tick tock is claiming the reason that they re doing this the reason why they re basically making it where you can t upload new content in russia and you can t view new content in russia they re claiming is to protect their users against that new law that russia has just passed but a lot of people are claiming this is really because china owns tick tock and tick tock is just doing russia s bidding here now it s important to point out that russian tick tockers could use vpn a virtual private network to bypass some of these bands however vpns are greatly restricted in russia and i m sure putin isn t gonna probably implement new laws to make those restrictions even harder given that that s probably the only way someone can circumvent these things but oh just one clarifying question on this so when you say china owns tick tock so it s like a chinese it s a it is a chinese based company right yeah bit dance the company that owns tiktok is a chinese based company got it got it so like and and basically our read on that is like if you fight dance if you re if you re a company operating within those borders then chances are that the government has like a strong you know hold on on your decisions yeah i mean this isn t just affecting tick tock a lot of western media has pulled out of russia cnn a lot of entities like that they re not even doing work in russia anymore because they can t we re given this law so it s kind of a wider scope but it s still in place in ukraine right like uh tick tock yes tick tock is still in place in ukraine and there was uh you know we talked about this too about the russian government asking tik tok to uh at least take down some of the ukraine war videos across the board uh just because of its effect that it would have on uh young people um i ve as a person who uses tick tock a bit i ve seen a lot less of that but i am still seeing people um from ukraine uh posting things about the war so they haven t scrubbed that entirely uh but yeah there was some talk of even getting rid of that but ukraine as of right now still has access to tick tock yeah i mean the history of the tick tock is interesting we ll have to cover it more another time like you know india for example doesn t even allow it yeah within its country because of their relationship with china so yeah um you know we ll keep an eye on this uh trump uh once tried to ban it and yeah it has a very complicated history but uh but yeah so unfortunately you can t watch any tick tocks from russia but you can still watch tick tocks for me so that s that s that ll that ll make up for it uh we want to thank you all for watching and listening make sure to

debate a show for political eclectics i m ravi gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlot well corey what do we have today well on today s show we are seeing new fault lines in the republican party we talk about the diverging past between mike pence and the rnc then we check on the freedom convoy that s overtaking the canadian capital we ll take a look at how gofundme is driving fresh controversy around those protests blue states are dropping mass mandates and china is pouring more money into the metaverse but first things first after nearly two weeks joe rogan is still in the headlines and i m honestly sick of talking about this guy the podcaster first received scrutiny from musicians on spotify for spreading covet 19 misinformation on his show but the attention has now shifted to rogan s prior use of racial slurs in a compilation video posted on social media rogan is seen repeatedly using the n word in various podcasts over the years a separate video shows him telling a racist joke comparing black people with the planet of the apes that s messed up now rogan has issued an apology for both of these videos and spotify s ceo is standing by him but the pressure to d platform and cancel rogan continues so where do we come down on these new allegations on everybody s favorite podcaster yeah i i m with you in that i hope this is the last time we re covering this for a while me too but i think where we are right now is you know he s gotten renewed scrutiny over everything he s ever said i mean his shows can be really long some of these shows could be four hours and people are picking through those and you know found some some really rough stuff there s a lot of attention to like his use of the n word and whether it was in or out of context i think we don t really have the full clips for that because they were taken down but there is this clip that you referenced which is the plan of the apes clip we get out and we re giggling oh you see plenty of games we walk into planet of the apes we walked into africa dude we we walked in the door and there was no white people and as he describes this was a terrible clip let s look a little bit at his apology here for this i was trying to make the story entertaining and i said we got out and it was like we were in africa it s like we were in planet of the apes i did not nor would i ever say that black people are apes but it sure __ sounded like that and i immediately afterwards said that s a racist thing to say corey what do you make of that um i mean i mean it s real easy to kind of you know have that hindsight you know uh you know 2020 is high um hindsight is 20 20 with that you know so basically you know when you re looking back on something it s really easy to put it in context but before he made this particular video his full explanation for the planet of the apes comment was i was telling a story in the podcast about how me and my friend tommy and his girlfriend we got really high we re in philadelphia went to see planet apes didn t know where we were going got dropped off by a cab we got dropped off in this all black neighborhood and i was trying to make the story entertaining and i said oh we got out it was like we were in africa it was like we were in planet of the apes so that was his full explanation and i mean out of all of this i think the key point is we got really high like this is the right wing this is their new poster boy like someone who just gets high and says racist things and to be honest you know at first we were all mad because he was spreading misinformation about cov19 like that s what the original beef with him was and then it shifted to this new you know these allegations of being racist and these are not new allegations these videos first circulated back in 2019 when he got the um spotify deal i think before he got the spotify deal so this is not new information so 50 of me is like well we re just shifting the goal post now we re just we re just we re getting mad at him for something else because we couldn t cancel him for the vaccine misinformation for the perceived vaccine information so 50 of me is like well that s not really what we were talking about at first but then the other 50 of me is quite alarmed by how many people on the right has have doubled down their support of rogan after all of this it s almost like there were people who wasn t even talking about him that much that have now jumped in because it s become full blown council culture culture war nonsense and so that i find a little bit alarming but at the same time it just it just it s one of one of those things that you do when you re trying to counsel somebody you go through 20 years of their past and try to bring up everything you can and i don t know if that s 100 fair given where we started this conversation right and when you say we like obviously we didn t call for his cancellation over the covet misinformation and i think right now nobody has the power to cancel joe rogan like even if spotify were to kill this deal with him you know as we talked about in the last podcast or one of the last podcasts the rogan probably could make more money outside of spotify especially if you take into account that if they cancel this contract you probably have a serious penalty so he d probably take some money from spotify go start his own thing and their offer is out there right there are people already offering him the same amount of money to do his podcast elsewhere so the question is what do you do about this so for him he s apologized and it s not for me because he didn t he didn t speak about people like me so it s not for me to be the leading edge of people who accept or don t accept his apology and i m not like a long time listener i listen for the show and i listen every now and then when there s some kind of medical thing on there like you know lifespan or peter a tear or somebody like that but i thought derek thompson in the in the atlantic had an interesting take on this he said at some point people spending our time spelunking for his worst recorded moment need to ask themselves what do you want what is the outcome we re rooting for and then later on he says this is the bottom line arithmetic of fame joe rogan has 11 million listeners and i do not we don t um and you do not correct we don t uh we can t change his audience i just hope we can change his mind that s where i am which is this is a super influential person 11 million and you know as you described like the right seems to be particularly enamored of them but there are also members of the left uh who are gravitating towards that podcast and my sense is given that he s not going away i understand people are like we need to like like take our music off this platform or stop engaging with him etc is i think that he s got way too powerful a platform for anybody you know who s trying to persuade huge swaths of america to just ignore at this point and i think the strategy to try to persuade him and his audience is it makes a little bit of sense to me yeah and i think it s worth noting that um daniel eck the spotify ceo kind of comes down in a very agnostic way on this um in a statement he said i strongly condemn what joe has said and i agree with his decision to remove past episodes from our platform which all the episodes in question rogan decided to remove and he said i want to make one point very clear i do not believe that silencing joe is the answer and it s worth pointing out that rumble offered him 100 million dollars to leave spotify like there s not really a route to totally canceling joe rogan and i think that you know i mean i always come down on the side of redemption it s regardless of who it is or if i agree with them but obviously these clips look really bad and um and i appreciate that despite a lot of people on the right who say never apologize to the mob i believe in not apologizing to the mob when you haven t done something wrong but this is an example of a really bad look this these clips are really really unfortunate they reflect very poorly on him and so i think that this apology hopefully can mark a turn and even his last apology and committing to some more responsible um kind of metrics of bringing different voices in and stuff i i hope that this is kind of a reckoning and whether or not i agree with all of the kind of cancellation attempts on him i think that it is important that he kind of takes this new this new responsibility very seriously absolutely i mean i don t really have a problem with joe rogan i i have a problem with the people who are trying so hard to defend him when he himself is apologizing like you just said ricky there are people on the right saying no you shouldn t apologize for this well i mean it was wrong for him to say these things you got people on the right trying to ignore these comments you got people on the right trying to justify them saying things like well we don t know the context he s a white dude saying the n word i don t really have to know the context to know that that s not right that that s problematic and then you know uh there was there was a eclipse coming out over the weekend of people i think it was uh one of the hosts of breaking points posted a a video of joe biden saying the n word uh when he was quoting someone uh implying well why can t joe biden do this and rogan can t no joe biden shouldn t do it either like like if you go to court you don t want to impeach him over it but you just say it s wrong right well yeah i mean it s like this idea of if you did something wrong you can t just say well somebody else is doing something right wrong and that s the reason why you shouldn t get mad at me for doing something wrong and we seem to do that all the time it s the what about is in olympics absolutely absolutely so uh speaking of breaking points they had a segment the other day about this and this was the description of the segment it says crystal analyzes the rogan smear campaign from the perspective how it represents a deeper rot of american politics and what the end result of something like this could be so basically our reaction to this is a symptom of the rot within american society i m with there on that our country s really __ and these moments i think only underline that but then she goes on to say that uh people are more concerned about rogan s words which have been taken out of context than the real problems facing society now i think some of his words may have been taken out of context but as he describes the the plan of the apes thing was just wrong and he apologized for it and i think people shouldn t be going above and beyond to tell people who are apologizing that their apology is wrong like i don t think rogan is like afraid i think he s just like hey i said something shitty and i m apologizing and it is interesting to me that there are defenders of rogan who want to go further than him and defend him he could defend himself but i think this gets even more interesting when she said and breaking points for people i think a lot of our listeners especially um the youtubers know breaking points is a it s a big alternative media company which launched about a year ago huge audience and they put put together a lot of interesting content and she said they have bigger things to care about and she went on this like segment about like there s all this problems economic inequality and stuff we should be focusing on that kind of stuff there are in one sense about a billion things going on in the world more important than the current efforts to shame smear and censor one single podcaster you ve got hunger poverty war despair climate collapse just take your pick here s my problem breaking points and a lot of this alternative media have no problem doing segment after segment after segment about cnn msnbc and the problems then they literally did a segment a week before about maddow it was 10 minutes of straight gossip about why maddow was you know why is she stepping back she s doing a podcast she s doing a film here s the you know kremlinology of msnbc and here s who s up here s who s down it was mocking msnbc apparently insiders were thinking she might take some time off in the spring well that initial time off has come a lot more quickly than people expected then they extended nicole wallace now they have nobody in the prime time what are they going to do who is going to take over they have nobody now who can compete with tucker i mean rachel basically was the liberal tucker and now it s dead i cannot wait to see this thing crash and burn so my question is why is that okay but when we in and maddow last time i checked his 2 2 million viewers uh rogan according nielsen has 11 million so rogan is a more powerful media platform why is it okay to critique and mock uh msnbc but not rogan who has 11 million people i don t hate rogan but i think he s a powerful guy as is breaking points now in a lot of this alternative media and they don t get to to play by a different set of rules than everybody else like there s this sense that we re the smart serious people we get to critique media but if you re critiquing media it s because of some witch hunt and some bias so i have a real problem with this and i think that in general i think that legacy media is an improvement upon what came before it in many ways like i think like coverage of things like the wuhan virus alternative media sorry uh alternative media like the coverage of wuhan for example like there s a leg the alternative media is gonna push boundaries in a lot of those stories in ways that the traditional media has not the problem is sometimes they throw 10 darts at a board and if one of them hits they re like yeah i m super smart um whereas we re like all right let s go back like when you did that segment about january 6 and it being an inside job like is there follow up to that like you know and you go one after another and so you ll notice these patterns the bigger pattern that i m worried about though is that uh these alternative media figures are friends with each other they go on each other s podcasts so the people from breaking points when they launched they went on rogan they got a lot of their audience from that i m jealous in many ways i could ready to see the commentaries like i would love that audience now um when they go on rogan to me that means that they have a relationship with him just like maddow no statler and you know david axelrod and all those people scratch each other s backs and that s wrong and we should point that out when people in alternative media know each other and have each other s backs we need to call that out too they don t get to play by a special set of rules and when they become bigger than the rest of media it becomes even more incumbent on us to critique each other it doesn t mean that i think they re bad people i love a lot of these shows i listen to rogan like every now and then i listen to breaking points a decent amount i think like they did a segment on quantitative easing last week or the week before that i thought that was really smart but it doesn t mean they re perfect and so for me i think if we replicate in legacy media the smugness the double standards overconfidence of traditional media it will be a huge mistake i would just point out one little wrinkle in that situation though i don t think anyone s a mean from criticism and i would critique any podcast no matter what my my relationship is but i think that there is a difference between calling out cnn or msnbc for hypocrisy and what s happening to rogan right now with trying to de platform him like nobody and maybe there s like some french people who are saying we should take msnbc off the air but i think that that going that next step is what is particularly concerning to me um with the rogan thing but i d also say i do kind of agree with her in the sense that this is a symptom of a kind of societal rot because i don t know anyone in the beginning of the pandemic who said you know who i m going to turn to to tell me what to do about vaccines joe rogan right like this is this is a symptom of a failure of public health messaging a failure of our politicians and our health officials to keep people together and in this together and i think that you know rather than just point the finger at rogan we need to all like all of our institutions need to point the finger at themselves and start thinking like how how did we get to this point this is super weird and i feel like rogan is just sort of like a figurehead of this whole thing but really not what s behind his popularity in a sense he s almost like an accidental uh center of this entire debate but i think like i would agree with you if the only focus of these segments like breaking points was about the people trying to de platform them but what they were saying is like the focus at all on what rogan s saying is like you know she said that people are concerned about his comments uh which have been taken out of concert they re not focused on the real problems in society but like my point is like and she s not saying that specific to trying to de platform it s just the focus it s the attempt to criticize him etc and for me and you ll notice it within breaking points right like they criticize people who they don t have strong relationships with and they they take it really easy on the people that they have strong relationships with that s what the legacy media does like they scratch each other s backs they hang out at the same parties uh and they look out for each other and for me like why is it okay like why is it distracting to focus on things that rogan says we re not trying to do platform we re just saying hey that was shitty and if if he s for instance spreading misinformation which is not necessarily what this segment is about pointing that out is not saying we should do platform we did that the other day uh but then saying like all right like here s like literally every breaking points episode is some clip from cnn or embassy embassy saying oh here s what you know brian stetler says here s what maddow says and let s you know even colbert and let s mock that or in some cases like very validly critique it that s not distracting right but why is it distracting if we do that for rogan that s my question do they do that with like tucker carlson and sean hannity see that i don t know i m not as knowledgeable about that i do know that they might have a relationship with with tucker because i think he did a blurb on the way well it just sounds like they re a part of the societal rot then because they re on one particular side and they re only fixating on critiquing the other side and by the way like joe rogan is a weird person to put in his position for the right because isn t he a bernie sanders supporter like he s not a right winger that s what i m saying that s why i hold out like like to me it s like an evolution right and like once again like like i don t i don t necessarily i m not in rogan s heart so i don t know if he s a good or a bad person i just say like here s a guy with a really important platform and i hope he and like per derrick thompson s point i hope he evolves in the ways i would want him to evolve but i don t get to make that choice right um but i think like people could critique us and say well okay well what s your bias so you know that s why we have a system like every 365 days here at lost debate we re going to put out a report that says here s everybody who s giving us money and small donors can opt out because they like i value their privacy so if you give us 25 bucks which you can do on our website uh then you re not gonna then then you don t have to put your name in that report but you give us like a thousand plus dollars you go on this report and not only will we report who gave us money which i think goes above and beyond what a lot of these platforms do when they do patreon but we re also going to include in kind contributions so if you put me on your show i m going to then put that in the report and for everybody who s given us money or giving us in kind contributions by helping us get to their audience i report any reporting that we have done about those people and we re going to do this every year and say all right you put me on your show right you put me on midas touch or something um have we talked about midas touch did we not talk about myself was there a pitch that we let go by and we ll try to be as thorough as we possibly can and that s the best we could do um and then people will be like all right well you guys are like you know the david s to the goliath so the breaking points so who are you to point them out you re jealous they re audiences like sure you know bill maher is the david to cnn s goliath they have way more viewers than him fox news certainly does that mean he can t critique them no i mean it s even more important for the davis to critique the goliath in these situations i don t know enough about their kind of editorial edge but um yeah i ll let that stand i like the transparency there i love the transparency well moving on to our next story former vice president mike pence is breaking with his old boss to an extent we haven t seen before here s what he had to say at an event for the federal society on friday i heard this week that president trump said i had the right to overturn the election but president trump is wrong i had no right to overturn the election the presidency belongs to the american people and the american people alone and frankly there is no idea more on american than the notion that any one person could choose the american president on the very same day pence made these remarks the republican national committee formally censured two republican members of the house liz cheney and adam kinzinger for serving on the january 6 committee the rnc accused him of persecuting ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse really an awfully sanitized way of describing the attack on the capital so on the one hand you have pence pushing back on trump s 2020 narrative and on the other you have the rnc fully endorsing the big lie what does that tell us about the current state of the gop i think i m having a hard time keeping track of this narrative you know first it was wrong and people were condemning january 6 within the right and then it became an antifa uh plot and then it became a deep state plot but now it s legitimate protest again and uh it s i m just it s maddening the revisionism that goes on here i was glad pence sent what he did uh but i think like if you go beyond this and say you know you take what pence said uh but then you stack it up against what the rnc did in centering kenzinger and cheney last week and saying that it was legitimate protest you take uh you you look across the country to censure uh efforts i mean there s just one after another south carolina gop centering representative wipes wyoming gop centering representative cheney clark county washington uh gop centering representative herrera boitler michigan gop you can go on ohio gop with representative gonzalez and i think like when we re talking about the sort of olympic level what about ism they ll be like well what about arizona democrats uh centering cinema one censure and that was wrong i called that out uh but it also wasn t censoring her uh over something like january 6th it was a stupid center over her ideological votes in and not supporting uh overturning the filibuster for voting right still a stupid censure in my opinion but when you stack that up against what s happening here to me this is an alarming trend within conservatives yeah and just anecdotally i know a ton of people who were trump people and no longer are and i think that there is a large and growing faction within the right who who feel that way and obviously there are still a ton that don t but i don t think that the way that the republican party is moving is really reflective of its entire base nor do i think that the way that the democratic party is moving is reflective of its entire base with with the filibuster reform or you have someone like manchin who represents a more moderate group of people and i think that on both sides we re seeing that definitely with the centering it s it s disproportionate with the gop and that s a specific issue but i think that we re seeing that we don t really have a two party system in this country i it s something that i feel very strongly about after january 6 it was the first time that gallup ever recorded 50 of people identifying as an independent i think that ultimately our country is going to be pulled apart if we have these weird purity tests on either side which certainly trump is the figurehead of that on the right and on the left it s more ideologically based um and i just think i think this is a moment to really say like there s no way that these two parties can represent the most diverse country in the history of humanity like this is just absolute garbage and there s no constitutional basis for them to even exist like george washington s farewell address was like don t let two parties pull us apart and now here we are so i think you know good old george knew what he was talking about but do you think there s a difference between ideological purity tests and which i i know exactly is part of the reason why we started last debate and i think part of the problem that the the right has and this is an ongoing fight i have with my father who s a big trump fan is that because it s a cult of personality then things like january 6 could happen which i think like that i d be hard pressed to imagine something like that happening within the left because the ideology of the left includes a basic respect for democracy but also there s no one figurehead that that you know democrats would barely hold it together to vote for the same person in an election um when you have a cult of personality it allows you to to go over the waterfalls in situations like then say no matter what this person says like i ve asked my dad before point blank while i was recording him uh trump said you know he would shoot if he shot somebody in the middle of fifth avenue would you support him and i asked my dad would you support him if it were uh if he did that and my dad said yes and then i said what if that person was me and he wouldn t answer that question he wouldn t even say i wouldn t support trump if he shot my own son and so and then you know my dad get mad at me because i have the audio so that s my own father that s __ crazy like absolutely crazy i think it s definitely different the like whether there s a figurehead and it s it s not a one to one comparison but i think that there s there s definitely like within the democratic party you have like the really progressive aoc kind of group and then the older democrats that aren t feeling that way like i i think it s just it s just reductive inherently to say that the american people are going to fit into these two parties and that these institutions are somehow going to be truly representative of them i think that we have way more than two parties in this country and i think that examples like this especially on the right demonstrate that there are a lot of people who are on the right who say no i don t stand with this and luckily pence s actually has the guts to speak for them on this issue yeah i 100 agree with you ricky that the two party system is broken and we need to abolish political parties all together in my opinion what do they call them at the founding the associations like they were associations yeah something like that there s a really great quote from washington which i won t try to quote off the top of my head but look it up the farewell address it was like it was like wow he literally predicted exactly what would happen he called it he definitely called it um speaking of associations laughter thousands of truckers and protesters have descended on ottawa canada s capital to protest vaccine mandates and work restrictions the mostly peaceful protests quickly became a media hail storm commentators on the right consider this the most successful lockdown protest in north america the left has pointed to confederate flags and nazi symbolism to denounce the protest as far right extremism now we ve taken a lot of time to dig through local reporting scrape social media and look up the organizers involved so guys what do we think this i think this is the first time on the show we ve talked a little bit about this protest that s going on with the truckers in canada what what do we think of this yeah we talked about our neighbors to north at all i don t know but it s canada you know we were i think you know we ve been we ve been seeing and thank you listeners and viewers we we ve skyrocketed in in u s uh rankings for political podcasts we re now in the top 50 but in canada i think we re the top 100 right now so we ve got some canadian listeners out there uh so i want to shout out our neighbors to the north i m going to try to do right by them by not overstating our knowledge on this situation i ll just say from a starting point that this is the kind of story that makes me excited about lost debate because when i look at the headlines you know you have on and one side you have headlines like canada s freedom convoy is a front for right wing anti worker agenda canada s truck convoy is just a stunt in a country where populism is still taboo and then on the other side you have critics mock puppet trudeau for fleeing capital during trucker s protest tyrant on the run uh and then you have go fund yourself the trucker convoy and great by the way like it s like your new york post headlines um go fund yourself uh the trucker convoy in canada is the most dramatic and most effective protest against covetera overreaching backseat mandates in north america that is medial polarization if i ve ever seen it i m not saying that these are equally valid points of view or invalid i m just saying from a starting point engaging with this story it is stark how much different like the two different like and different sides of the media are portraying the story definitely and it reminds me during the summer of 2020 the coverage of blm riots where on one side it was praising them and on the other side it was highlighting the very worst aspects of them and when you have large groups of people congregating there will always be the bad apples and i think that both sides use that excuse to not listen to the actual core complaints and i think we ve seen it now on the right and the left um with this specifically it s worth noting that this is being called an anti vaxx rally 85 of the truckers are vaccinated the organizers said in a press conference that they held that they personally are vaccinated um but they re specifically this is these are their own words the trucker convoy is not anti vaccination this is an anti government mandate many of us are vaccinated we simply believe every canadian should be free to choose and they also say that they won t block any emergency vehicles and that they ll help anyone in need so they ve laid out the ground rules i mean of course it goes without saying that the grotesque symbols that have been spotted i condemn entirely but that express an explicit goal i think is worth talking about and yet trudeau and the canadian leadership have not really addressed that and have really just honed in on the worst aspects of this protest and you know ultimately the the regulations here are pretty asinine because they re just now implementing a vaccination mandate only when truckers are crossing the border um and this it s a 14 day quarantine if you re not vaccinated regardless of whether or not you test positive or negative so these truckers if they re not going to get the vaccine they re not going to be hired they if they have an 85 workforce it s a very small amount of people but like they re not nobody s going to hire those guys to carry their stuff and we re in the middle of a supply chain crisis this is our number one trading partner and then omicron is happening where the vaccination isn t really stopping the spread maybe arguably it s slowing it but i think this is pretty rich coming from the prime minister who right now has omicron despite the fact he s yeah he s coveted positive but he s so dreamy though you can t say the vaccines are going to stop it yes explicitly that is the transport minister said in response to this our plan is to defeat coveton and the pandemic while trudeau is positive despite the fact he s vaccinated it s just this isn t a great policy for people who are in trucks isolated alone yeah it seems like a strange place to implement a mandate you know as you were talking about this earlier this morning about like how people uh you know they re not interacting with a lot of people these truckers yeah and i don t know like what what possible public policy is this i mean they still interact with some people when they re dropping off loads and i think the i guess crossing borders crossing borders and going to so many different places exposes them to a lot of different areas a lot of different people but i agree they re they re mostly alone most of the day it doesn t really make sense to make them have a mandate but this particular incident is interesting to me because there s so many republican politicians who are showing support for this protest um that s a little odd considering that all of this is going on in what is still technically a foreign country uh the gofundme account for instance we were talking a little bit about that uh after raising around nine million dollars gofundme terminated the freedom convoy account gofundme stated that they released one million dollars to the organizers after they provided details on how they would distribute the cash but then suspended the rest of the money after law enforcement said that uh previously peaceful demonstrations have become an occupation uh and then originally gofundme was going to try to keep the rest of this cast just like themselves well i think they were good well i think they were gonna they re gonna give it to other chairs yeah give it to other charities but yeah that s still kind of shady yeah and uh i agree eventually they walked back on that and they re just gonna refund it to the people who who uh who donated but i mean we don t have the exact numbers on this but a lot of those donations arguably probably came from americans right wing americans who see solidarity with these protesters but what if antifa blm protests in the summer of 2020 were getting foreign money to fuel their the fear of their organization what if gen 6 was fueled by russian money we would consider that foreign interference in our affairs how is this not foreign interference in their affairs from our part yeah one thing i do want to clarify is that i i think there s probably more than right wing people involved in this just given like libertarians there s like a lot of libertarians a lot of people on the left that i know don t like vaccine mandates too so i do want to i do want to acknowledge that but i do agree that the the wrinkle of you know cross state political or at least activist cash flow uh there definitely seems to be a double standard here i do agree that this is really shady by gofundme and i think musk pointed out that their you know gofundme had no problem funding it was i think farmers who were donating food to occupiers inside seattle during the floyd protest so it does seem like there s a double standard at work here and a lot of what happened with gofundme seems really shady uh and there s something facebook did i think around this too and they didn t provide details where they accused some of the organizers of some kind of q anon overlap or something but they didn t really explain it really well and this is why the transparency is really important to me these are private companies they could do whatever the hell they want but as consumers of it and also as a person who worries a little bit about the growing power of these things you d want a little bit more context and explanation about the way that they apply these standards and i think it s interesting there s kind of an ongoing partnership between local law enforcement or governments and these corporations now that are getting caught up in this this was pressure from the local authorities in canada that ultimately made gofundme change their tune and then pressure from ags in america who have people in their states that donated to this campaign saying we will sue you if you don t refund the money um and so i think it s it s really a strange kind of intersection between big tech and government and i think that it s it s a little concerning to see that these companies i mean are rightfully influenced by local governmental authorities and i think that that kind of boundary needs to be really established because ultimately no matter what side it is or whether or not you agree with it the idea of governments kind of working in tandem with these private companies could be really disturbing and could go awry ultimately yeah and one sort of i want to just acknowledge a couple things that i was trying to figure out in in light of this story especially for people who are in canada probably know a lot more about this like it was hard to get to the bottom of like what kind of unlawful behavior is happening at these protests like there s this you know the sense that they re honking and keeping people up and getting tickets for that or blocking streets and then there s the uh allegations of certain uh you know nazi symbols and other far right uh types of symbolism beyond like like traditional political discourse and going into potentially hate speech type stuff and there are allegations and i was trying to work my way through all this and and i can t say for sure too much other than the authorities seem to believe that there s there are laws being broken it seems like there s a wide spectrum of laws that they re implementing ever you know like things that seem really obviously problematic like honking in the middle of night keeping people up versus other things like that are you know kind of like nuisance type laws where you re not exactly sure what law they re implementing on paper yeah it s worth noting um in terms of the arrests um one has been for property damage one for driving while prohibited and five for mischief i don t really yeah you re not sure where that is yeah but i mean it definitely seems so far that there s not been any like severe violence or anything um that people were concerned about which we should all be glad about but um yeah it s it seems pretty murky all the reporting on what s actually going on it is very murky and i think it s just all it takes is for one or two idiots to ruin a protest like this i mean the inclusion of of nazi uh nazis just takes one nazis to ruin a party absolutely and i mean it doesn t make any sense canada fought against nazis i mean why would you have a nazi flag there there were confederate flags there yeah we fought that that s you though and we got no we we got plenty of them yeah which also doesn t make any sense but it really doesn t make any sense for people in canada to have confederate flags i m almost certain they weren t involved in the american civil war right we need them to be cool because if there is another one like yeah that s what we re going to have to do so yeah that s the american refugees now justin trudeau i just want to take issue with what he said he said today in the house members of parliament unanimously condemn the anti semitism islamophobia anti black racism homophobia and transphobia that we ve seen on display in ottawa over the past number of days together let s keep working to make canada more inclusive i don t think there was a whole lot of the the homophobia and transphobia there and islamophobia i don t think that there s any even records of that happening at this protest that we know of i m not yeah i couldn t find it i want to be careful to say it yeah i mean because it could be possible and i m sure there s some alignment but it just seems like trudeau is just trying to hit the like the political bingo card of all the different things that they have to condemn and you see this a lot with left wing politicians here it s something that i get really tired of it s like they say all these things well we got to stick up for all these different communities unrelated communities by the way we got to stick up for this community this community this communist community it s like you re not even talking about the issue at hand you re just just telling us all the people you basically want to support to the next election yeah i was looking at some polling on this from abacus data which is a market research firm based in ottawa and 68 of respondents said they felt they had quote very little in common with how the protesters in ottawa see things and 57 percent found that the protests were offensive and inappropriate while 43 found it respectful and appropriate now that doesn t mean they re illegitimate a lot of protests aren t necessarily uh like even civil rights i m not comparing this civil rights but even the civil rights protests uh at the time in the 60s did not have the majority of public support so like 50 plus percent is not the metric by which we we measure a good or bad protest but it seems like some of our friends up north have a look like they at least uh are taking issue with some of the things that are happening on the ground in ottawa right now definitely and i mean it s also kind of against the backdrop of some really strict coveted lockdowns and measures that canada has taken which have more been established by the provinces rather than the the actual like federal government there but um you know i think all of the talk about the obviously reprehensible uh minority of protesters who are like displaying flags and stuff i m not hearing trudeau actually talk about the issue at hand that they re expressly expressly there to protest and um some of the authorities have said that we re not interested in talking to the truckers or meeting with them they ve expressly said we re not going to consider rapid testing at the border or anything like that and and i mean they have a 14 day quarantine even if they test positive like this is just a weird mandate it only affects 15 of truckers and yet i think that there s so much energy because it s against the backdrop of like pastors were arrested in canada for having church services they couldn t have it outside they couldn t have drive in like there were a lot of really severe lockdowns up there that it s easy to forget as an american it s a hard job too i think that s worth pointing out like yeah when i see a poll that says they have very little in common with the protesters or how they see things i m like i m not surprised that most people don t have a lot in common with truckers because i think truckers are like they take on one of the hardest jobs that we have in society and just like for in a very different like way different side of the political spectrum i have a lot of sympathy for medical workers and i think i emphasize that a lot when i m when i m debating people who feel differently than me about certain covet laws um those are really hard jobs i think driving a truck is really hard and i have sympathy for people who are frustrated even if we have different beliefs on vaccines i think it it i could feel the frustration of having to do that job and then adding this 14 day quarantine and if you truly believe that the vaccines are problematic um even if i disagree with that you add that stress on top of this job it s tough i get it absolutely well speaking of covert mandates blue states have started dropping mass mandates this week new jersey connecticut delaware and oregon have all announced they will lift statewide mass mandates ricky this is something you ve been following closely is this good news i think it s good news that they re being dropped in schools um and so yeah the four states that you um announced those are all dropping mandates in the coming weeks and it s important to note that they are now leaving it open to the more local authorities so if a school still wants to have if a school board decides that they still want to have a mass mandate they can um and if a parent still wants to mask their kid they can if a teacher still wants to wear a mask they can but this is opening up some options and i think you know you can have a different conversation in the different age brackets of k to 12 but i think especially in the younger kids this is this is clearly a victory i think because developmentally in terms of their language their their social connection recognizing people kids who maybe don t speak english at home and need to read people s lips and really develop those skills i mean there s there have been a lot of studies that have found especially boys and especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have been struggling with their verbal progression in the pandemic especially and so i think this is a good step to allow this to be a more localized approach yeah and and ricky you sent me this article from the atlantic which talked about there s you know our cdc the national cdc is has been quoting the head of the cdc has been quoting this arizona study which uh claims to say that uh that schools with mandates were 3 5 times more uh effective at fighting covet outbreaks than those without it and like that s a that s a pretty strong statistic if it s true but as this atlantic article pointed out and other experts have pointed out there are major problems with this study so um there s noah haber who s an expert and author of systemic reviews of covet 19 mitigation policies said that the research is quote so unreliable that it probably should not have been entered into the public discourse uh and and he pointed out and others have pointed out specific problems with the study number one was that um the schools that had mandates had fewer days of school uh than the schools that did have mandates which alone you know you re going to spread it less if you re there less it also didn t control for vaccine status within schools like a really important piece of information um because i ricky i still believe that there s probably a chance that vaccine status um has something to do with spread i m not convinced of it with omicron but it s irrelevant at least like because if we later find out that being vaccinated means that you re less likely to spread it you d at least want to control for that in the study and it s actually a really easy thing to control for so that study was problematic there s not a ton of data that say that these school closures were effective i mean the the mass mandates in schools were effective and so yeah as much as like i i believe in masks generally especially the certain types of masks this seems like overkill so the cdc recommends that for ages two and up um everyone should be masked in a universal sense in school settings and you have some really extreme versions like in new york city kids are in recess outside wearing masks they re not seeing their friends faces they can t interact in l a which is absurd like outside uh huh there s no science there s no support in la they re requiring vaccination but they still have to wear non cloth mats even for sports like it s it s really ridiculous and especially like this is i m less concerned about high school students that s an inconvenience i mean i m still anti mass mandate i think it should be a more local uh situation but for the under five age group it s just absolutely ridiculous the who doesn t recommend it for under the age of six um the european center for disease prevention and control recommends against the use in primary schools and you know you have a situation where flu and pneumonia heart disease drowning guns motor vehicles those are all much larger dangers to kids in this demographic and we re really this like if there s one thing that i could do one restriction i could drop to make things go back to normal this would be the first one yeah i m with you on this and i m still believer in the protective power of mass so even after the mandates are gone and in new york and other places when i go to the supermarket and i go on the subway i ll still wear my mask if i m on an airplane how long do you keep are you gonna keep that up i don t know like i do think that like there are certain countries where when they had an experience with a pandemic it just becomes part of the culture and i could see myself in flu season all the time just wearing because first of all it s freaking cold in new york and i actually like wearing my mask now i m like one of those people who was allergic to wearing the mask outside because of what it said about you like to me it means that your anti science wearing your mask outside in new york um but i ve been wearing it in the winter because it s cold uh but and that also happens to be the same season where we spread germs more and so being on the subway wearing a mask to me it s not a problem but i m not sitting in school for nine hours uh and you know i m not gonna allow you to bring out the bingo card but there was a previous job that i had where that would make me really sympathetic to some of the people trying to keep these kids in line with the mask because like trying to keep a kid sitting up straight paying attention in class is hard enough nearly impossible in certain contexts adding another piece of clothing that you need to worry about i don t know i feel for people well by saying class i think we can figure out what that job was but this is my bill clinton i feel your pain episode i m feeling the pain of the truckers and the nurses and the teachers and that s why everybody i m running for nothing i m not running for i would hope that yeah yeah on a c3 we can t do that when when are we going to get rid of the mass mandates here in new york when wouldn t we think that s going to be sounds like coco is going to make an announcement on thursday i believe are you doing any reporting on this for the post um i m not at the moment i haven t covered that personally but i know that you have a you have it what 18 months can you imagine masking him at the age of two what s your take on that he would take it off and throw it at us and just yell at us for the next hour for even being bold enough to attempt to put it on him yes for sure uh our last story we re going to go inside the metaverse once again with robbie who has an update for everyone s favorite and least favorite digital universe what is going on with china in relation to the metaverse yeah shout out to the economist had a really good article this week about uh chinese incursions into the metaverse now you might be like well the metaverse kind of doesn t exist yet what are they doing uh well strap in here s what s happening a lot of people thought that china actually would be averse to the metaverse in many ways like they ve done things like you know restrict the amount of time kids can play in video games they obviously have like a really strange and restrictive approach to the internet generally and you could imagine that the metaverse would be a threat to china because it s it s potentially a and it s not just one place like they re going to be multi meta versus meta versailles i don t know versailles yeah there should be a meta versailles i would visit that but they uh but uh you d think that it would be a threat to china because you allow people to cross borders to express themselves the way that they want you know change identities but china i think senses that this could be a threat and like any authoritarian regime they re looking to shur up their standing in this new area so that they can ward off i think any uh potential threats to their power and maybe even use it as a tool of their power and so here are just a few examples of uh developments in china in the metaverse so in december and january the cities of shanghai wuhan and haifei put the development of the metaverse technology into their five year plans which is how they basically make decisions and implement government in china in november um the xinjiang uh province held a metaverse industry development symposium where speakers agreed that uh this is this is the area that s home to alibaba group by the way that they re going to be the forefront of the technology in october the chinese institute of contemporary international relations which is like an elite think tank within china affiliated with the government described uh in a paper on the metaverse that the next generation of the internet is going to be the metaverse and that they need uh laws to deal with quote virtual labor economic crimes and other areas uh issues in the gray area so we can imagine what that orwellian double speak means you can keep going there s a think tank at the ministry of industry and information um which called on tencent baidu alibaba um you know to basically make take certain steps in these directions and it s just and this is on top of the fact that just within a few months last year a billion dollars was invested in chinese metaverse technology companies um and they have the players for this so they have 10 cent they have alibaba they have baidu and 10 cent is particularly a player to watch because they re you know one of the if not the biggest video game company gaming company they are among the biggest and when you put together the sort of collection of technology companies that china has they have a lot of the the sort of rails that could allow them to do well here like headsets um sort of vr ar technology uh their own versions of cryptocurrency um which you could see like china was cracking down in bitcoin but they re gonna they re gonna try to create their own and own their own rails so i think this is a huge threat how much money do i have to have to get into the metaverse right now it s expensive i don t remember i actually the last time we did a story actually looked because i was like all right if it s you know if it s at a certain amount price point i was like all right maybe i ll throw a little money into the metaverse but it s expensive i think ricky you looked at something i remember you saying yeah i feel like i don t know i m gonna quote it wrong but i think it was like eight thousand dollars for the cheapest real estate or something like that it was in the thousands and it s cheaper to new york still yeah i don t know but this whole thing thing feels really analogous to me of like the wechat thing and how they they ban specific technological platforms and make their own kind of um like uh government authenticated versions and i feel like this you know it s easy to have this new terrain of the metaverse and think it s gonna be really utopian but i think this is probably a pretty good example of how i could go really awry and we should tread lightly into that territory if you ask me it s almost like a certain kind of digital space race and there s this the saying in china which is like overtaking on the curve which means beating the west on a key technology before the west gets there they did this on 5g they ll do it on 6g which a lot of people think is going to be six g s yeah i know there s going to be a 60 uh but they re actually pretty good in certain ways they re definitely doing this in genetics which is some really scary tea leaves on that front uh and so they re looking to overtake the us in this technology and it s tricky because if they succeed in developing a robust version of their metaverse which i think is inevitable that they re going to create their own version of it it might just mirror what we have now you know where there s a chinese version of it and then there s an american version of it and they don t necessarily interact which is kind of a bummer because i think i don t think that the metaverse is necessarily going to be good or bad yet and it might be complicated like like the internet is today but there s a world where the internet can be freeing to people like if you have a disability the metaverse can help you express your way if you if you want to express yourself as an able bodied person which not not everybody with a disability necessarily wants to but if you wanted to you could or if you had if you identified differently than um what you ve been genetically given you can uh or like the way you express you can do that you if you if you re in bangladesh growing up in poverty but you want to interact with americans but you can t leave your country or afford uh to get on a plane then you can interact with americans or canadians like or whatever um and or if you re like in you know family that s separated in india pakistan or in the palestinian territories in jordan you can interact with people uh in a more tangible tactile way than otherwise could there s so much potential for good here and that s why i wanted to bring the story in it because i don t see the media covering this other than like a mocking of zuckerberg which i m for it let s mock zuckerberg as much as we want but i think because he was one of the first people to really get out in front of the metaverse and call this company meta i think people think of the metaverse as only facebook but it s not there are ton of different technology companies in this the the book is just starting to get written if we re if we re looking at this book now we re on page one of the metaverse and so i wanted to keep coming back to this because i think this has the potential to be one of the most if not the most significant technology story of the next few decades more uh important i think in many ways than cryptocurrency i actually think they overlap because you can imagine people transacting in cryptocurrency in the metaverse because you know if we re doing this cross border tactile um sort of exchange of goods and ideas etc uh one way to get around all the complicated uh laws around you know the flow of currency is potentially to to transact in the currency of that whatever metaverse universe you re in and you can imagine that being cryptocurrency some interesting stuff we ll have to keep keep an eye out on it so we got a couple of follow ups we want to address from a few of our previous episodes there s been some changes to some stories that we ve talked about one of them is changes to this story about brian flores the the former coach of the miami dolphins what updates do we have there yeah and i actually should have thought of this when we did this story last week but i ve done some i ve seen some articles that were speculating that flores the former coach of the miami dolphins who launched this lawsuit against the nfl we did a story on it what i didn t mention the story was the possibility of an arbitration clause in his contract and people have speculated and they ve looked at other coaches contracts at least as of today i haven t seen confirmation that there is an arbitration clause in his contract with the dolphins but there has to be and i should have thought of this now what is the uh and people have shown other coaches contracts to say hey there are these arbitration clauses and why is this significant because you know you do this when you sign these random waivers with technology or you re going to the gym or whatever a lot of times you sign away your right to bring a lawsuit in traditional court when you interact with a big company and a lot of people are critical of these clauses i certainly am and what happens is you go to an arbitrator who s supposed to be neutral but these are not neutral parties most of the time they re companies that that want to keep business with these companies and so the nfl i think probably will pick the arbitrator that happens often and obviously those arbitration companies are not going to piss off the nfl so it s basically a way to for for lawsuits to go to die but uh where i sit right now i m not sure if that arbitration clause would apply to all the other claims about other teams because he might the the contract i think would only govern i think his relationship with the dolphins yeah but not the broncos on all these other giants and everybody else there s also a federal agency that you can bring these types of claims to that um is a commission that can investigate the claims and it it the arbitration clause has nothing to do with that so uh there s a world where whether you know flores gets money or not or some of these corrupted measures happen or not the the nfl is still like squarely within uh the sort of sites of some sort of discovery process some kind of prolonged process and so they may decide to settle this even if there s an arbitration closet issue yeah does throw a small different wrench in that case though another thing we wanted to look at was we did this study on lockdowns we talked about this study on lockdowns we didn t actually conduct it but we talked about this study yeah we re busy around here yeah we re yeah uh we talked about this study on lockdowns last week i know ricky you had a lot of opinions about this particular piece and there has been a couple of updates on that yeah so um essentially the way that we left it was kind of debunking some of the claims that there was no rationale behind what studies were picked and we left it kind of in the place of we d like to see what the experts have to say and a lot of experts have weighed in there s a lot of controversy surrounding the study um specifically i think the biggest issue is what they consider a lockdown and theoretically under their definition any form of sort of mitigation policy could be counted so even if you just had a mass mandate or something and so there is a lot of back and forth within the medical kind of epidemiological community and i so obviously this isn t something that i can speak to as a non expert but i definitely encourage anyone that s interested in it to dive into some of the twitter threads and different articles and arguments that are floating around in the web about whether this study is valid and i ll be interested to hear if the original authors do respond to these criticisms ultimately sounds good well we

debate a show for political eclectics i m robbie gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlott well corey what do we have today well we got a pax show today democracy is in decline around the world according to new analysis we ll talk about the reasons why a new front in the crt school fight why you might be hearing a lot more about curriculum transparency this year and finally police arrest two hackers accused of laundering over four billion dollars worth of stolen bitcoin all the weird details surrounding that story but first things first last week twitter and several mainstream media outlets piled on comedian dave chappelle headlines claim that chappelle helped kill an affordable housing plan in his ohio hometown a video also surfaced of shepell appearing at his local village council with an ultimatum hi i m dave spell i just want to say and marianne i can talk to you about this privately um i don t know why the village council will be afraid of litigation from a 24 million a year company while it s out the 65 million a year company i cannot believe you would make me audition for you you look like clowns i am not bluffing i will take it all off the table that s all thank you so was dave really trying to kill an affordable housing plan well after diving into the village s meeting minutes videos local news sources and the developers proposal we found this story to be much more complicated as it turns out the developer who was trying to rezone the property just north of chappelle s house to build what is called a planned unit development never set out to build any affordable housing on its 53 acres instead the developer had plans to donate 1 75 acres to the village for future affordable housing so did the mainstream media get this story horribly wrong uh what is going on with chappelle here i have a few uh embarrassing things to to point out here i think number one is that i had even before the scandal i ve gone on zillow and looked up housing prices in this town because i m like addicted to using zillow just to like travel the world and i was like oh i wonder what a house costs in chappelle s uh neighborhood so that s number one number two is i think the story is like a window into how we as a society and especially media treat these kinds of stories is like this is a town of 3872 people tiny and it s gotten so much attention where you know there s a moment this morning where i was researching for this segment where i was looking at traffic patterns sewage electric in this random town in ohio and i just stepped back and i was like wait a minute um i live in soho new york one of the biggest nimby areas that s ever been created in society and not only that i helped elect a city council member my buddy chris marteau shout out to him who is the most nimby city council member in new york city right now fights every development that comes into this neighborhood and so i was like maybe i should examine my my own practices here it s why we actually did an episode of conor doherty at the new york times from the new york times a couple of episodes ago of regressives where he talked through uh some of these challenges that progressives have where we oppose uh development and it leads to you know increased scarcity of houses increase prices and why that s bad but as you pointed out like this is complicated we don t know what s in chappelle s heart there it seems like there are many reasons why you could have opposed this thing and what i would ask people is take some of that energy that you re you re bringing to chappelle and maybe figure out what s going on in your neighborhood down the street from you and maybe examine and change your practices that s certainly what i m trying to do here definitely and i think that this is kind of symptomatic of a larger phenomenon that we re all kind of guilty of when a story comes out and it s somebody that you might like or you don t like and you initially kind of have you re you re a little more willing to accept the negative story about someone that you already don t like and i think that that s kind of what happened on twitter and with the media rolling stone had a headline dave chappelle s latest achievement helping kill an affordable housing development which was pretty ad hominem and i think it s worth noting that like we ve been talking about the story since last week here at the lost debate and we spent a lot of time doing our due diligence and pouring into these minutes and trying to figure out what actually is happening here and it turned out to be a lot more complicated than these sort of like quick flashy headlines have to say and even i would say as someone who works in journalism most journalists don t even have control over what that headline says and so when we have these sort of ad hominem attacks like this with a situation like chappelle there s actually a lot more of meat behind the story and we actually pulled a second clip that hasn t been getting as much circulation that gives a lot more context to what chappelle is talking about i just want to say i m adamantly opposed to it obviously i live behind the development for the proposed development i do have many business interests in town i ve invested millions of dollars in town if you push this thing through what i m investing in is no longer applicable and i would say that over it can come and buy all this property from me if they want to be your benefactor the average age in the village is 49 years old without a school you will not attract young families and this city will not live beyond the retirees that decide to settle here and i m surprised that marianne mcqueen is is suddenly not averse to change because you always are when i uh uh propose a change and now all of a sudden we have to recognize the change these changes are inevitable but we do have a decision on what they will or could be and i think we should use more of a visionary i uh i instead of a reactionary one because the potential of this place is immense and over is not the only solution so i think this clip this clip comes from december so this is a much deeper debate than just this one meeting that went viral and i think it s worth noting that he s saying there s an inevitability to creating affordable housing in some sense but that this specific model that was being applied might not be the best solution yeah there was something he said at the end of this that i want to point out he said we should use more of a visionary eye instead of a reactionary one because the potential of this place is immense and ober which is the developer is not the only solution i want to underline that statement this means that he is i think and a lot of these people are against all of this like and i think i could quibble with their strategy to oppose this you know particular zoning or that zoning and say this may lead to less affordable housing or the others but my sense from chappelle in this clip is he doesn t want any of this he doesn t it s not that he s against affordable housing necessarily i m not in his heart but he s just like i don t want this development period uh that was my sense of this clip yeah it s really interesting i think people saw this proposal and saw like the words affordable housing and how now if the proposal wasn t going through then the affordable housing was going through and they just cherry picked that and turned it into this larger argument about affordable housing but as we ve already talked about the plan only allowed it 1 75 acres which is nothing which is nothing yeah i mean to hear it s a lot but yeah it s got to be nothing i know you know because i was looking at yeah you were looking at that you were trying to get that pretty cheap yeah yeah and also too there was no plan in their proposal to actually build affordable housing it was like we re going to donate this land to the village and they can eventually figure out how to build affordable housing here at some point years in the future so it s not like he was physically killing affordable housing it all it almost reminds me of like high school when like you if there was anything you know get edited again well marianne s at it again but also too it reminds me like if you were somebody in high school that you didn t like and you heard a rumor about them that was just salacious and everything like that you d be like oh i could totally believe that because that guy s a jerk so yeah that s what this is kind of it just sounds like all of the people the detractors here who hate chapelle they piled onto the story because of previous things that they didn t like about shapel but it had nothing to really do with this tiny town s actual politics you know yeah well before we go on corey walk us through this visual that that you helped create with the help of our team just to give a sense of chappell s why chappelle is particularly animated about this development well i m not going to take credit for this we have we have a wonderful editor and producer here nick who helped who helped make this uh picture and basically as you can see on your screen right now yeah for those who are at the listening a lot of those listening this is we re basically showing what the development would look like and it is it is like literally when we say in chapel s backyard it is in his backyard and if you re watching if you re not watching we have chappelle s head basically where his house would be and then the literally there is no space between the top of his head and the bottom of the development there s literally like i mean i don t know what it s what the scale would be but i mean that s like less than an inch for sure and so this this is clearly clearly this was going to be in his backyard and clearly there was a lot at stake here for him and he just didn t want these this proposal in the background again i don t see any affordable housing a lot i don t even know where the 1 758 would be in this in this setup it s important to know that what would be in his backyard is the development not the affordable component right yeah because it does it does it it s not there well yeah we ll throw this up on our instagram for the podcast listeners uh so that they can they can check out this nifty graphic i think one thing just to close the book on this is hopefully this we can use this story to educate people about some of like the affordable housing issues around this country and so for example there was this debate around uh well there s only luxury homes going in here and that s one example of of an issue and trend that i would pull out and say all right well that s relevant for people everywhere if you live in san francisco seattle new york et cetera often people uh like my councilman will be like this is a luxury tower and therefore it s not gonna make an impact on affordable housing and what i have heard credible critics say back is well there s a downstream effect if you build more luxury houses then the the uh apartments houses wherever you live uh downstream from that will become more affordable over time if you just increase the overall stock kind of sounds like trickle down economics yeah well it will you could think about it in new york right for example like like a lot of these apartments that we re running now were way way way cheaper before right so it s not like there s any fancy components to these apartments it s just that their value keeps going up because of the scarcity right so i think like so like let s say you build this quote unquote luxury apartments down the street from here and you double the supply in soho uh then theoretically though places like where we are right now where my apartment would be cheaper that s that s an argument now they re probably good counters to that but i think like if we get out of this debate like a more nuanced version of these debates around the country that would be improvement i would say yeah and i think this is just one of those examples where you just can t take a headline at face value you have to do some research actually go in and find out what s really going on before you you know try to crucify a pretty decent comedian now on to our next story democracy is on the decline around the globe just under 46 of the world s population lives in a democracy down from 49 4 in 2020 the 2021 report by the economist intelligence unit sets a record low score for democracy around the world in the biggest one year drop they ve recorded since 2010 the reasons for democracy s global decline are complex socio political trends pandemic aftershocks stress on the global economy and conflicts around the world just to name a few but the overall takeaway is pretty clear democracy is not strong in the world right now so let s take a look at this from different perspectives ricky uh the united states prize itself has a strong democracy we we talk about spreading democracy around the world usually by force but are we really holding up true democratic values right now well according to this analysis it seems like we re on the decline um we ve been deemed a flawed democracy we re number 26 worldwide our neighbors in the ranking are chilly in estonia just to give a sense like not i don t think most people would have expected that as american citizens um and the categories that they break down are elect the electoral process political participation uh civil liberties the functioning of government and political culture and the places where we had huge losses our political culture and functioning of government and i think you know in terms of the functioning of government it s pretty obvious to anyone living in this country um with january 6th with the russian collusion narrative like it s gone from bad to worse in terms of people not trusting our democracy for a variety of reasons on a variety of sides of the political spectrum um leading up to the 2020 election one in five partisans on either party believed that violence was at least a little bit justified if their party lost which is super frightening um we have the issue with gerrymandering and the way that our two party system has kind of incentivized politicians to be at the most extreme versions of their parties the large and i feel growing middle of the country is not being represented politically and our parties keep driving further and further apart and then in terms of the issues of political culture i think that s pretty obvious that s essentially why we re here and we have this company is because we have a partisan media we have social media that s driving people further and further apart i d imagine that the pandemic and locking down and really only getting information and not talking to people through these lenses made things even worse and we re at a place where 53 of republicans say they have democrat friends and 32 percent of democrats say that they have republican friends so we re not talking to the other side we re we re afraid to air our beliefs a lot of mainstream beliefs are considered beyond the pale almost two thirds of americans say they re not comfortable speaking their minds politically in some contexts and so if the issues that are on the table for our country to be grappling with can t even be discussed i m i m not surprised to see that we re lowering in the rankings yeah that political culture number really jumps out to me uh the there was this data from this uh varieties of democracy institute and they ve been tracking data from 1980 to 2020 and they rank regions and countries on a zero to four scale and zero means that political groups interact in a friendly matter manner and four means that they interact in a hostile manner and what s really interesting to me is that around 1980 we were around 1 5 on that scale meaning we re relatively friendly with people who have different beliefs in us and now we re approaching four so uh that means that we ve gone from friendly to hostile in my lifetime because i m older than both of you uh and that s really scary and i think a lot of us who ve been around long enough can feel it right like political discussions uh especially i trace this back to pre iraq war used to be fun like you would be able to debate about the tax rate and you you know like everything felt like almost like a west wing episode and now if everything feels so existential and hostile and personal and nobody s trying to persuade each other anymore and ricky i want to underline what you said this is why we start this company it s like we have a theory that there actually is a group of people out there who are dying for nuanced discussion they don t want to be manipulated they don t want to fly a flag they may have like strong beliefs when they go to the ballot box and so like they may be averse to like you know fake balance but they want people to actually try to figure out the issues in real time with some some attempt at objectivity yeah but it s not just a problem in america i mean this is globally we re seeing a drop in this the democracy index i know you were doing some research about india and you were just you were telling me some crazy stats about what s going on in their government because technically they are a democracy but they re considered a flawed democracy like us and so tell me a little bit what s going on over there yeah the the the economist who also put together this report had a separate article in the same issue called and the titleist article was the organs of india s democracy are decaying and if you look into this data it s really scary india strangely in this past year went up in this ranking but over the past few years has dropped pretty precipitously and there was this one data point that really blew my mind and this is from the association for democratic reforms they say that a record 43 percent of members of parliament who won seats in the 2019 general election in india had been charged with a crime 43 percent 29 were booked for grave offenses such as rape and murder so that s a 109 increase from the cohort 10 years earlier and here s the kicker uh a candidate with a criminal record is three times more likely to win than one without so crime is literally paying in india this is a country with 1 38 billion people the world s largest democracy and so this report which you know focuses a lot on china and china s rise and its influence uh is now being we have that problem but then at the same time our world s largest democracy is decaying and as ricky described um you know the world s most powerful democracy is decaying as well and this is troubling that s very troubling the fact that you re three times more likely to get elected than any if you ve committed a crime is insane to me and this report also details just the fact that it s not only so much so that the countries that were already like authoritarian regimes you know they re remaining that of course but also that the strongest symbols of democracy in places like north america and western europe they re starting to slip in these scores and i think that s what s so troubling but also like you said uh you mentioned the china problem and that s a big part of this because china has been so successful economically speaking over the last three decades and that was not supposed to happen with a communist country like they were supposed to go the way the soviet union did and instead they ve done the exact opposite they ve actually been expanding their economy a lot faster than we have been doing in the united states they have the second largest gdp in the world right now and a lot of people are saying that that s the reason why democracy globally is looking less flattering uh i i ve heard things where people chinese leaders have said things like the western electoral democracy model produces inferior leaders time wasting deliberations and a lot of gridlock and when i read those things it kind of sounds like our congress yeah well the same issue is is true of india too the gridlock and and the economist points that out and there s this really awesome newsletter called cynosism um with an s and they uh they translate a lot of chinese news both like in the mainland but also uh you know chinese news abroad and uh what s really interesting what s really interesting to me is that the you know china chinese media which is you know controlled by the state or highly regulated by nothing s really being said without them being okay with it they re just repeatedly banks as strong they ve been doing it for years they ve been talking about how flawed we are they they they take every embarrassing weakness we have in our country and they continually bring it to their population say look see do you want that or do you want what we have right now and it just makes me ill because we re feeding the narrative by being so dysfunctional this is not to let them off the hook so i would much rather to state the obvious live in the united states than china just by a long shot much rather live in india than china but they re effectively uh using our own weaknesses against us so i mean this may be a loaded question but what can we do to help foster democracy and to help fix it because like you said when china says something like that when they have this a planned economy where they can they can plan things out 20 years ahead and they don t have to worry about some crazy election happening four years from now ruining that plan so how can we better uh do that here where we ll not necessarily plan everything out so ahead but how can we try to fix democracy to where it actually works institutions is supposed to be a good thing it has to be institutions like and that s why i think all of us are here and i think why media in particular is such a big important institution here like media in many ways is reflecting back our polarization and then making it worse and so that s why we do this here and one thing is worth pointing out is that canada because i know we have a lot of canadian listeners to the podcast especially is also declining and this report has you know is basically saying canada is starting to look more and more like the us in all of the worst possible ways obviously the trucker stuff is just a reflection of a larger slide happening in canada which is just really sad yeah and i think it also requires kind of like a societal rededication and redirection towards the tenets of democracy and you know i think as a young person seeing my generation the way that our attitudes towards different opinions towards free speech towards tolerating difference is in some ways on a deeper and more philosophical level really low and i think you know we re several generations away from the founding of these democracies like i mean nobody alive remembers the the need and necessity for freedoms in america for free speech for for these values that are so central and i think that our education system needs to recommit to to classical liberalism to pluralism to free speech to the values that are so fundamental and if that means civics education i think that s super important because how how will a generation of young people exercise the the rights and their freedoms that are required to live in a democracy like ours if they don t know what they are yeah there s like a ticket that you need to punch in a lot of neighborhoods around this country to even be in polite company and the the kinds of things that you need to do to jump through those hoops are getting more and more elaborate and i can speak of it from you know progressive new york for example like if you re uh if you re anti abortion uh if you re you know if you re like pro quote unquote police or anti reform of the police uh if you you know want to lower taxes i mean you start to go down this list and you ll say like if you have any of these beliefs uh you re not allowed in to this you know into the conversation to a friend group or whatever and i think that s i think super destructive uh and we re starting to like self segregate into ideological clans and that can t be good no absolutely not and in alabama it s the reverse like if you re if you re if you re pro abortion you wouldn t be allowed in that if you re against guns you wouldn t be allowed in certain groups so it s definitely a problem but ricky you mentioned education and that s actually uh what our next story is going to be about the fight over critical race theory in schools is moving to a new front curriculum transparency at least a dozen states have proposed legislation that would require teachers to post their lesson plans online now supporters say parents have a full right to the fullest possible picture of what their children are learning opponents say it piles on unnecessary bureaucracy on teachers and could quickly lead to censorship in the classroom our resident uh a former school principal here well you said it not me so that doesn t check the bingo cards can lead us in this discussion so what do you think about this idea of uh curriculum transparency so i think there are to take a step back about crt generally there are there are different sort of phases of this right there was the original term which was like this legal term that really wasn t in widespread use but most recently crt has come on it come to take on a much broader meaning that includes a whole bunch of different things and most recently and this was this was a big flashpoint in the virginia elections the crt debate centered a lot around the curriculum being used in the classrooms and the trainings of teachers and we ll get to you know some of the hotter debates about that today but essentially they re pulling curriculum out of classrooms and trainings and saying this curriculum is you know either trying to say that you know to use immutable characteristics to describe students and separate them or tell them to feel guilty about who they are or you know that kind of stuff um and then there was this second wave which is the book banning stuff that we ve covered before where uh parents uh elected officials etc are trying to pull books off of shelves and as we ve reported on and many others have the trend is is towards increased levels of activity there where more and more books are being pulled off the shelves so those are the two first phases now we re on this third phase which is the transparency phase where uh some you know prominent figures in this debate uh on the right are signaling that they re gonna be pushing one uh pieces of legislation around the country to say all right teachers got to put up their curriculum teachers uh need to um talk about what books they re using ahead of time and the strategy here is very transparent so christopher ruffo who s like the in many ways people describe as like the father of this modern strategy from the right on curriculum transparency um basically did a tweet storm where he described in detail uh what they re planning to do and so and i ll come back to those tweets in a second but it s just very clear this is a debate where they re trying to get liberals to oppose transparency that s what that s what this is about interesting ricky i mean you re the person i think has been in school the the most recent out of all of us i mean what are some of the things that you ve seen um just from your experience about like the separation of people and things like that so i um i graduated in 2018 from my boarding school so i was in the private school sphere so i i don t really know in terms of the public education which is what s kind of in question here but um there was a recent wall street journal expose about associations of private school or independent schools and paul rossi who s actually a friend of mine listened to like hundreds of hours of kind of dei content and he personally thought that it was really divisive and you know just in in 2014 i was going back through um my school s community day that they held on martin luther king day where we had options of different lectures to go to and i pulled some of the titles for people who who wouldn t who i i if i wasn t if i didn t have this life experience i would look back at this and and all this debate and say well this sounds like a lot of mumbo jumbo and like maybe the crt thing is overblown or maybe there s not weird stuff going on in school well um bruce lee in asian masculinities examining and understanding male privilege inequality for all unpacking white privilege what is the role of skin color in society everyday sexism so these are lectures for a captive audience what grade were you in i was 14 at the time you looked like a freshman in high school freshmen in high school kids that are at a boarding school away from their family and like you i i m all for it s a private school they can do this but i m i m all for in a public setting k to 12 where these are government officials where they have a captive audience they have little kids in their care and we it s compulsory we have truancy laws and it s there they work for the government i m all for as much transparency as possible because there is weird stuff going on i m sure that you know i went to a woke boarding school that s probably different from your typical k 12 institution but you know there is there there is weird stuff it s worth worth pointing out yeah there was something in this article that really caught my attention and and it s it s worth mentioning that a lot of uh what i m about to say hinges on the author s interpretation of these videos and we reached out to them and we only reached out to them yesterday uh to just ask like for the primary source material so we ll report back if we get that because that would confirm some of the things i m saying here uh but one thing that they found and i ve seen other examples of this from around the country but they say that within this training that they viewed perfectionism punctuality urgency niceness worship of the written word progress objectivity rigor individualism capitalism and liberalism are some of the characteristics of white supremacy culture in need of elimination now i ve seen this kind of stuff around the country and it rhymes a little bit with actual things that people like teach for america were pushing at the time when i was working in schools and my problem here is punctuality so you re saying like showing up on time that s racist in and of itself to say that that s white supremacy or um objectivity the written word like you re telling people who were working in k 12 schools that the written word is white supremacy well we have to take that with a grain of salt because this is one person s observation of these things and these are the adjectives they decided to describe these things with i could see how some of these things i mean like punctuality everybody needs to be on time obviously however there is something called cp time uh no no i won t get into that um but uh and then and then the whole thing with uh just a joke about am i allowed to laugh at that we might have to cut that one out and then um and then but but this but this idea i can make that joke uh this idea that um there was another one you know the the written word well that may come out of this idea that certain people who are not white may speak in a different dialect may use a different diction than what is used normally and that not necessarily going against proper english but saying that the inclusion of other ways of speaking should be at least explored in these school settings so i just think we have to take that kind of stuff for granted yeah that s where the primary source i think would be really helpful and that s where i step outside and say well what is this does this check out to use ricky s example like of her experience and then my experience in schools and and i would say this is part of a broader movement to weaken things like curriculum standards standardized tests the emphasis on math and reading which i felt this viscerally where like a lot of people from that sort of dei camp were saying that emphasis on math reading writing uh were in some ways like propagating the capitalist system racism yadda yadda and i just think that it s easy for you to say you know people who have all the privilege that you know making sure kids can read and write is racist because if but if your kid came in and wasn t able to read on grade level or write on grade level it would be a you know a massive massive emergency for a lot of these families absolutely you know yeah i mean i m certainly not uh advocating that we don t make kids reading right yeah and we certainly should have rigor in in schools but some of the things that these these republican legislators are proposing to go against crt are are really insane to me in florida there was a bill being proposed that would put cameras in the classroom to monitor kind of like a big brother style surveillance of classrooms in mississippi there are talks of live streaming kids class i don t know anybody who would send their kids to school that s working they re not gonna have time to watch the live stream of their kids class there s a state rep named doug ritchie a republican in missouri that is proposing a bill that would require schools to post all teacher training materials online in addition to descriptions of what is being taught and then his claim is if schools are doing things right they shouldn t have to fear this legislation but i mean that could be said about gun control well if you re not a criminal you shouldn t have you fear god you can say that about it about anything yeah you could they could audit my finances every day and use that argument right now and be like well what do you have to worry about exactly so here s and this is i think really important there s a there s a line uh that a lot of these legislators are crossing and let s talk about one side of the line first which is i think the stuff that i think is legitimate about transparency so i i think it s helpful for schools when they post the curriculum being used in the classroom in a way that parents can access you know because that allows parents to help their kids it allows them you know other parents to collaborate if i were designing a system i would i would provide an easy way for teachers to provide that transparency without like you know onerous requirements that it needs to be up that very day and that it needs to you know in that like uh like every single little piece of paper needs to be up there right but there you could probably keep it manageable a lot of good schools already do this and i would also provide an opportunity for parents to collaborate because often what happens is parents are buying materials or creating materials or figuring things out about how to help their kids but they re not talking to each other so a well designed system would actually connect parents to actually help each other within the system but this is worth pointing out is like that s one side of the line when you cross over to this like surveillance stuff i think that s a problem and it belies the strategy here this is the the chris ruffo the guy i was talking about earlier this is like a tweet storm he had from january he said my goal this year is for 10 plus state legislatures to pass curriculum transparency bills requiring public schools to make all teaching materials easily available to parents via the internet it s time to get the political predators out of the shadows and return power to the families the strategy is to use non threatening liberal values like transparency to force ideological actors to undergo public scrutiny it s a rhetorically advantageous position and when enacted will give parents a powerful check on the bureaucratic power and then he goes on to talk about how he anticipates that the left is going to oppose this which has been happening um there was one legislator in wisconsin who put out a really tone deaf tweet about this and had to delete it terry mcqualified a quote from the gubernatorial election i think parents should be telling schools what they should teach so democrats are walking into this trap opposing transparency i think they need to be clear about the line say i m for some transparency but i want to make it manageable for teachers but i m not for cameras in the classroom i m not for teachers harassing parents harassing teachers and you know there s got to be some kind of balance here i mean to me though when you read that those tweets that s just acting in bad faith he s not doing this because he wants to allow parents to have a greater interaction with their children s education he s just doing it to get the liberals in a gotcha moment and force them to capitulate that s just that s just political engineering that s not that s not what is what good does this do for the children well i think it s worth pointing out that in the kind of contract of a public school teacher it they re serving in local parents which means in place of the parent and they therefore they re in sort of a pact i work at fire which is an organization that protects academic freedom and they they do point out that you know these codes between parent and teacher call for neutrality and impartiality when dealing with matters of contention in the classroom and so i while i don t like the the true surveillance aspects of these transparency bills i have no problem with with requiring that school curricular posted if a parent wants to sit down at the dinner table when they know that a contentious issue is discussed and say hey what d you learn at school today and this is how we as a family think about it and and internalize it i have no issue with that and i also you know i think there are versions of the spell these bills that are going overboard but at the same time i don t really agree that it s a big brother sort of situation i think it s what they re trying to facilitate is a way for little brother as the parents to see what big brother the government schools are actually doing and exposing their their children to and so i i while i don t advocate for the like live streaming stuff i think that is kind of weird i i don t have any issue with making teachers have their curricula be public i don t think there s any problem with the making it public i think the problem comes in when a parent has a problem with something that s in the curriculum yeah and then it becomes too easy to just overturn the lesson plan yeah this is going to lead to a la carte like bespoke education which is unmanageable we already have a teacher shortage in this country right now and the idea that uh this is where the the details really matter i m for certain parts of transparency like i talked about but we need to be clear with parents about what they can and cannot do in a public school because we don t have enough personnel to say all right you re out of this lesson and then johnny s out of the next one and then sarah s out of this one and then we need all these adults watching these other people we need to create all different sets of curriculum for different people uh and so that worries me and i think that in a lot of districts around this country this is going to be an inevitability and as somebody who yes you pointed out has been in there you will be surprised what people will object to they re like people who object to certain math problems like especially when the common core was happening like some parents were like this is ridiculous like um you know like this conceptual math is like you know an obama conspiracy or something and then you know am i supposed to opt your kid out of this this test because of that like that s crazy to me you know so that s what i m worried about so i i do think like you know my my advice to progress was here is embrace don t don t oppose transparency writ large but just tailor these things to make them sensible and you can actually leverage this to make schools better uh like even randy weingarten pointed out that good schools already do this so my point to her would be well if good schools already do it what can we do to make all schools do it yeah well that s a good point and hopefully this improves education in america and doesn t destroy it now on to a story about bitcoin two eccentric hackers with colorful backgrounds were arrested last week for conspiring to launder 4 5 billion dollars billion with a b worth of stolen bitcoin the bitcoin was stolen back in 2016 during a hack that target bitfinex a major crypto exchange at the time now the stolen money represented one sixth of all bitcoin trading value in the world at that point took officials over five years to track this married couple down the suspects ilya lichtenstein aka dutch and heather morgan to make it even weirder morgan is also a rapper she goes by the stage name razzlecon and she can be seen in music videos defending her title as the quote crocodile of wall street music okay um so naturally netflix ordered the rights for a documentary three days after the couple s arrest crypto has obviously come a long way since 2016 but critics say its primary use is still for crimes like this does this story back up that theory um ravi take me into the demented and savage world of razzle con all right so a couple things about this story one is this this couple especially uh what s her name heather heather is like it s almost like 20 21 as a person like is the only person who could only exist in the year 2021 it s like i i have a friend who says like you could like there s certain parts of new orleans where you will you could drop anybody in there at any point and you just there s only one city in america you could be in because it s just so unique this woman is she could there s no other possible time even early 2020 like it s just she is so specific to the time period we exist right now um so this movie is going to be amazing i think she has a long uh you know future in in federal prison ahead of her um you know and my brother you know he s a federal corrections officer maybe he ll get her yeah uh and we ll we ll get some stories about that but but i do think there s a couple things noteworthy to point out about the story number one is that she s out on bond how is that possible this is a billion dollar heist if there ever was uh and there may be some simple explanation for this but if there ever was an explanation uh a a data point to suggest that we need massive bail reform it s this because it s like what is the purpose of bail like at this point like why why would anybody else be stuck in prison what s the explanation for that and she s allowed out on a billion dollar heist talk about risk right like i mean obviously there s violent and non violent crime yeah but my assumption is that there s some non violent people s you know awaiting trial in in uh prison in jail that that s is puzzling to me the second thing is this question that you pointed out which is the use case debate right like why is this goofy story important uh because people use these examples to say all right bitcoin its primary use case is for criminal activity like this that s what people say and so we looked this up and so in 2021 the total transaction value for all cryptocurrency hit a record 15 8 trillion dollars so that was up 567 percent an estimated 14 billion of that cryptocurrency was used for l illicit transactions in 2021 so that actually represents an all time low and compared to the share of all total cryptocurrency so uh this is the lowest level of uh illegal transactions in cryptocurrency we ve ever had and uh i have like certain i m not a maximalist on cryptocurrency i think there are all sorts of questions that need to be answered about it but this whole criminal activity thing i think it hasn t borne fruit it certainly seems true of the early days like you know the the um american kingpin stuff like the silk road and all of that if you were following those stories but i don t think it s true anymore but also pablo escobar had you know warehouses full of cash like that didn t mean that cash was bad it just means that we need to have certain uh guidelines in place to to follow the flow of money congress is on it a little bit uh and the treasury has and and you know there are different parts of the treasury that have gone even further recently to say that uh certain exchanges are liable if they violate like foreign sanctions and there s like a very strict liability standard that we re using for this to say that even if you didn t even know you were facilitating a transaction that violates sanctions that you would be held liable so uh it seems that this stuff is tightening up and that criminal activity is uh relatively modest compared to the share of transactions of crypto definitely and i think that s symptomatic of crypto becoming so much more mainstream obviously there the percentage of criminal activity is still concerning but at the same time i think it s worth noting that in some contexts what is considered illegal activity in authoritarian countries might be things that we actually support in a way and i m not i don t know what the details are but you know there s there s countries like china and venezuela i know china now has crackdown on crypto but there are people that live under authoritarian repressive regimes that have no control over their financial uh independence or even like there is there s a um a big crypto guy out in barbados who said that he s now worth millions and millions of dollars because in barbados they don t have access to as as a whole to paypal to credit cards to online banking information and so this is a way that you know there there s obviously going to be shortcomings but this is a way that people can circumvent bad government and even dissidents that have their bank accounts frozen and stuff like that like this is a way potentially if it s facilitated properly and the loopholes like what this couple exploited get tightened up then this could be an avenue towards truly worldwide economic freedom for people yeah i think uh richie torres uh the congressman he made some points similar to that about remittances yeah yeah but when they talked about bitcoin uh uh in the house uh the rap video i don t think that uh did her any favors to heather morgan because in it she literally said shout out to the entrepreneurs and the hackers like yeah it s kind of like i don t know what it is about rap that leads people to like admit their crimes in it like yeah i have a feeling she s gonna be dead to rights without this video but she s also a former forbes contributor and she wrote like a ton of articles about um cyber security and stuff like she was just out in the open talking about exactly what she was doing this is gonna be a great netflix series i point out a couple things i want to just underscore what ricky you said because i hadn t thought about this like you know if you re somebody trying to escape north korea and you have to pay chinese nationals for instance to help smuggle you over the border and get to safety and all that and you re paying in crypto that s a great illegal use case of cryptocurrency and and cory we were talking about remittances is a big part of this debate like sending money back to your home country if you ve ever tried to facilitate these transactions it s like more paperwork than trying to adopt a child it s insane how hard it is to send money across borders and i understand why it s the case like we want to like be aware of illegal activity and prevent it but it shouldn t be this hard one thing i do want to mention there is certain kind of crypto crime on the rise there s this phenomenon called rug pulls which is a relatively new scam on which developers build these uh what appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency projects uh and they uh get you to like invest in it in like in a fraudulent way and then they take your assets to something i think i know some people like family members in the older side who you know the kind of people who respond to the sort of you know west african you know fake email that says you know i m your whatever cousin or whatever you remember like these things that used to come out um and it turns out they weren t in west africa i don t know why they picked nigeria all the time and uh and then they came away with your money um this is the new version of that you know are you guys old enough to get that reference did you get those you guys yeah yeah i ve gotten it before like i m gonna dream prince you have to help me oh yeah that s what it was i ve gotten those emails before yeah it always came from hotmail i m just wondering why that was the story but i know some people who it s versions of that fell for that and gave passwords away bank accounts things like that so that s crazy there s some dr phil episodes about it the irs never calls you it s tax season that s always happened to you i got a bunch of those yeah yeah for sure yeah they used to leave me voicemail saying this is the irs you are under arrest for not paying something and it was like there s a positive version of it now where they say you you re eligible for a refund so they re using positive framing now for these games interesting interesting flip there yeah yeah here s here s news people you tell the irs when you re eligible for a refund not the other way around they re not going to tell you that you re eligible for that money i don t think they have the bandwidth yeah so we have a little bit of an update on one of ravi s favorite podcasts uh breaking points i do like them i have to say like i i just want to i want to use the kind of energy and scrutiny they bring to msnbc to them uh okay it s because i i respect them so much so uh we had previously last week talked about a february seventh segment in which crystal ball and breaking points uh talked about how this emphasis on the rugen story is distraction from larger issues like inequality and things like that and mice we called it out saying like look there are a lot of segments that you re doing including the very segment they were in that appear to violate your principle you know whether it s talking about msnbc cnn gossiping about the news my sense was given i m sure they re avid listeners to the show that they would have heard our critique and and and changed their ways they did not um they have gone on to do four segments in the past three episodes on rogan uh including uh two segments in the very next episode on rogan and so just updating our listeners on this phenomenon if you are a listener and an avid commenter on the breaking points site you might might want to go over there and just point this out in a very polite way because i think every minute they spend on this it s not a minute they re spending on things like quantitative easing and explaining you know how the fed works or you know doing a deep dive into that inequality and i actually think they provide a huge value on that front and so i would just urge them again to uphold their whole standard i can already hear the comments saying well if you re worried about how much time they spend talking about rogan how much time do you spend talking about them talking about three minutes three minutes yes done and this will be the end of my breaking point since yes feedback is respect feedback is respect great well we thank you all

built music and then we swing around here this is what biden s building music little sheds little shanty sheds welcome stations who do you trust people who have lied to you for the last 100 years in your political establishment or your own two eyes that god gave you boom there it is your open border the border is secure the border is closed it s wide open right now it s wide open you don t even have to sneak you just walk welcome to the southern border the border of the united states and mexico this is a special edition of benny on the border we ve changed the name of the show because we are in crisis this country is in crisis i currently stand on top of a pile of unbuilt wall good solid steel wall sitting rotting in the desert today you are going to see a show that shocks you you re going to see a show that absolutely exposes the corruption and the cruelty of the people in charge of this country the political establishment that wants you less safe we will show you with your own two eyes how they are making sure that your country is less safe your neighborhood your life your children at risk and creating a modern day slave state inside of america their cruelty knows no bounds get ready for this episode of benny on the border music we re going to build the wall it s going to be built donald trump s wall president trump here it is this is what it looks like look at this just a pile a pile of rusting wall this wall could have been put up in a month and closed down this entire section of the border to human traffickers and smugglers the size of this thing you got it sitting here rusting in the desert mexico is right over there and here s multi millions of dollars of wall rusting in the desert why because we didn t have the money because we don t have the manpower no sam no no because when joe biden became president he told the men who were working here on this site to stop they sat in trailers and got paid by our federal government and our tax dollars to do nothing to not build this wall all of the material is here you can see it with your own two eyeballs do you have eyes to see come and see look at this you have miles a fence sitting here this is mild they re like five rows deep straight down the corridor miles miles mile a fence that works you can see it up rotting they had the manpower they had the contracts in place they had the people and now look sam there you go there s your border you ever seen anything like it look at that there is your open border libs there s no open border they said who do you trust the people who have lied to you for the last 100 years in your political establishment or your own two eyes that god gave you boom there it is your open border there will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration okay explain what is this structure so we affectionately call these the bus stops and a lot of people that will come across during the day will actually come over here wait in the uh in the shade uh there s water always here for the people that are coming across uh and then this is where they ll discard their debris they re processed you ll see the plastic processing bags down below where they ll fill out their paperwork uh then that is um then that is returned to them they hop into the bus they re taken up to head sector headquarters where they re continued to be processed well it s time for the biden administration to act the drugs and crime that we re seeing rising in our states and flooding over the border is infecting our schools and neighborhoods sam instead of building the wall the bite administration has built the welcome center for illegal migrant smuggling and cartels look at this lecterns to process your paperwork water for the trip here are some pesos on top of the water bottle top the water jug here you got pesos left little thank you piles of trash piles of trash children s blankets i mean it s a disney blanket right it s dystopian you got a disney blanket here from a kid who knows where this kid s from has this kid been sold by his parents who knows there s their disney blanket coming to america all alone five undocumented girls from honduras and guatemala discovered by a texas farmer who gave them water and food in the sweltering heat they come across they wait right here until they re processed border patrol will show up with a bus two or three times during the day in the hottest parts of the year like right now they re waiting till about 11 o clock at night so between 11 and 2 they ll come across they ll again wait in these areas unless they re trying to run away and that s what they estimate to be about five to ten percent of the the actual traffic is is running away so 10 of the 1 4 million 10 on top of that yes that s their best guess and that s just looking at the footprints trying to establish how many people were in that group all of this ground they ll drag it two or three times a day so that they can look at the trafficking coming across um they re running cameras and then there they ve got the ground sensors so you may not necessarily see a truck but then there s always eyes on this area just wouldn t do it so now we have a world class security system at the border including the highest technology sam come here with me look at this look at how effective this wall here is the correctly installed wall yes john this is the correctly johnny yuma says this is correctly installed wall here s what you have this is what the wall was supposed to look like not rotting in the desert upright the wall is in cement it s deep down into the ground it s hard as a rock sucker is tall 30 feet plus there s no way over that i mean there s no way over there maybe you could get some type of sophisticated contraption but you ain t getting over that in mass and this thing s going to stop you look at this thing when effectively installed this is your deterrent sam this is it this is the wall place like this anywhere there s no place has anything like this or even close to it this is your difference this is what trump built and then we swing around here this is what biden s building little sheds little shanty sheds welcome stations a border town in arizona is seeing the cost of the migrant surge first hand the mayor has to use city funds to provide aid and covert tests to these migrants coveted protocols right here in case you were wondering all that stuff s been it s total right wing fake news right totally covered safe down here on the border there s a bottle of purell sitting on top of the station to fill out your paperwork inside of the biden welcome center the biden welcome center totally covered coveted safe all right definitely coveted safe to the border crisis now and some staggering numbers more than 212 thousand times border patrol agents stopped migrants at the southern border just last month that s a 21 year high we ve got some action right here oh there we go hey there we go sam oh yeah here we go there you go welcome to benny on the border there we go do you want to know about open borders today we got you we ve been out here for 10 minutes and here we have a large group 25 young migrants who just went running for the border little kids what s your reaction to the images of the southern border you want to see what s really happening on your border sam here we are how young are these kids i got a one year old i think you got some four year olds in there we re just standing here and they go bolting through the opening in the border there we go you want to see the true human crisis you have it there little children little kids the middle of the day as hot as blazes out here and they are just running across the border one border security guard here to stop this is the absolute state of open borders at your border this is what open borders looks like this is what president biden and vice president kamala harris have done to the security in our country this is human the human cost music johnny yuma what is behind us so this is an old kentucky fried chicken but the cartels took advantage of the opportunity of a thriving establishment and decided to create an

washington dc your nation s capital perhaps you ve seen on the news that there is a wall that has been erected along with military garrison to protect those in power up on capitol hill but what they don t want to show you is what s happening all around the rest of d c for people who live in dc they don t care about our safety and that s pretty obvious if you ve lived here over the summers pretty obvious if you walk the streets today it s middle of a blizzard here in washington and it s a chilling reminder right now of the state of dc behind me what you see is not some far off under the interstate uh barren location it s the senate two office buildings in fact that are the offices of dozens of senators the heart building and dirksen what stands before it one obviously nancy pelosi s famous wall you can see the garrison there to a permanent homeless camp a homeless camp that we don t know when exactly it popped up the last couple months but here it sits this camp has not by the way been attempted to be you know the city has attempted to to move any of these people they ve actually brought in sanitation and waste the city has used our tax dollars to fund the homeless camp this is the absolute state of washington dc a city in decline very scary on this episode of betty on the block we are going to look at some of the realities of living in washington dc and what life is actually like for the people who live there and who s really getting protected here today in washington music behind me you see the miles long fence that congress has put up to protect themselves because they felt scared in washington dc well guess what join the club washington d c has spent months and months this year under siege riots violence affecting not just our most notable monuments but also some of the more unfashionable areas of the city where i live there have been multiple homicides on this show we have covered multiple areas of the city not the fancy places where you might find the politicians but places where normal people live you have covered how young kids have been shot dead in the stoop of their homes guess what we don t get a ball we don t get a razor wire and military garrison in our houses on our streets protecting us this is what congress votes to protect themselves while the normal people of dc have lived in carnage all summer and fall and winter long i m going to show you something right now this is a video from my doorstep of a attempted homicide in my block that i captured with my own cameras that is how normal people live in washington dc so don t believe this bullsh from people saying that suddenly they re scared to live here this is what normal people live with every single day it s wrong for us it s wrong for them but they didn t do anything to fix it when it was us normal people who were being threatened normal businesses being threatened normal average americans being threatened in the community this is hypocrisy it s disgusting there were nearly 1 000 violent crimes per 100 000 people in the district of columbia in 2018 that is twice two times the national average rate of violent crime dc therefore is twice as dangerous to live in than any other state on average last year 187 people were killed making washington dc s homicide count the highest it s been in almost two decades homicides rose a staggering 19 in 2020 from the previous year assault with a dangerous weapon a category of crime rose three percent in 2020 motor vehicle theft increased by a steep 50 percent in 2020 arson crimes increased 63 percent in washington dc this year violent crimes are up in 2021 in comparison to 2020 violent crimes are up by a percent in washington dc since the start of 2021 this year there have been 17 homicides 15 sexual abuses 182 robberies and 317 instances of motor vehicle theft in washington dc that s one month of crime in this district a teeny district washington dc is without a doubt one of the most dangerous places to live and it has been that way we don t get a wall the powerful get a wall and security detail don t believe the bs that dc suddenly became dangerous they didn t care when it was us they only care about the powerful the elite and themselves when it comes to the overall proportion of homeless residents no state compares to washington dc of the district s 700 000 residents approximately 7 000 of them are homeless one person out of 100 is homeless in washington that s three times what the number is in california overall 19 of dc residents live below the u s poverty guidelines that s horrific that s a fifth of the city in poverty space for lease business for lease business for sale you see it all over the city washington dc i ve lived here for 10 years used to be a place with bustling businesses you couldn t even find spare space to put a business in now all over the city all you see are businesses for sale business for lease why is this this is specifically because washington dc had one of the most brutal lockdowns for coronavirus they closed down restaurants multiple times shut down the city shut down businesses and then allowed the mobs and the rioters to loot them this what happened all summer long it was horrifying for businesses and those that were not corporately sponsored shuttered right now dc is a ghost of its former self many business owners tell me that it will be years before dc gets back if it ever comes back this is a sad sign for a once bustling city nearly half of small businesses closed in washington dc due to covet 19 and the restrictions placed on the businesses by the leftists who run this city drove businesses into the ground unnecessarily this is cruelty one of the other things you end up seeing in this city now in washington dc is apartment for rent it s house for sale studio for rent places are going on to the market because people are fleeing this city has become expensive it s become dangerous and much of the business associated with it has been sent out of the city vis a vis the coronavirus and the draconian lockdowns that have affected our city this is what is happening to your nation s capital union station the crown jewel of washington dc architecturally one of the most beautiful buildings here in one of america s most prized beautiful cities now sent to ruin absolutely empty you

debate on conventional media for the rest of us i m ravi gupta and i m corey bradford and welcome to our very first episode and before we get down to the news of the week i want to just take a step back and explain why we even exist not just the show but our entire company the lost debate and to start i just want to tell you a little bit about myself i grew up in staten island new york to a family that s split politically in a neighborhood that s split politically and i ve got people in my life that i m either not talking to them or they re not talking to me because of my politics and it makes me exhausted and i ve lived this divide that we have right now and one thing that worries me deeply is that our media is driving us apart our media lacks nuance objectivity any tolerance i think that we need a different kind of project a project that not only brings us together but challenges us to listen to each other and i couldn t be more excited than to start this journey with corey bradford straight from oxford alabama welcome corey well thank you ravi i appreciate that and you know when i discovered lost debate online it was really interesting because you guys were already doing something that that i had been doing because i have a background in politics as well but for the last couple of years i ve been entertaining generation z on tick tock that s what i do i m still my famous tick tocker you know i do these satirical videos about politics and history and i usually take stabs at like you know both sides i critique the right and the left call them out on their bs but also you know point out when they may be on to something and that s exactly what lost debate is doing so it s really you know a unique opportunity to do this at a more serious sort of kind of journalistic level and i couldn t be more excited to start this revolution in media with you well corey and i are both what we like to call political eclectics so although we ve worked in politics our views don t fit neatly in one side or the other and this is a home for people like that so whether you re an independent you re the dreaded moderate or you re even somebody who has strong political allegiances but you re sick of living in an echo chamber this is the place for you and as background i ve worked in politics so i was one of the first staffers for barack obama s campaign and i went on to start an organization that trained over 100 successful candidates and over a thousand staffers but i also was a principal and superintendent of a network of charter schools and in that role i worked alongside republicans to protect those schools and one thing i came away with is that our country we have to live alongside people with different political beliefs than we have and that means we have to learn how to talk to each other about our different beliefs and our values speaking of that corey what are we going to talk about today well we ve got a lot going on today ravi we re going to take a look at how the twitterverse is politicizing this horrible alec baldwin accident wuhan china revelations was the right actually right on this one and why are trump supporters chanting let s go brandon we ve got a fantastic interview with democratic congressman richie torres from the bronx we talked to him about a number of things including his support of charter schools and some of the ways that he differs from other progressives in the democratic party a yale law student is facing cancellation because of his trap house and finally we break down the topic that could literally decide the virginia governor s race critical race theory and just what the hell it even is it s a packed show but first we re going to get into our segment called lost and found where we take the stories that the mainstream media lost but we found and ravi our set of stories today is not necessarily stuff the mainstream media lost but they just sound lost when they talk about it for instance these vaccine mandates regarding police officers we know that s going to be something that s going to be affecting police departments all across the board over the next couple of weeks and governor desantis in florida is trying to take advantage of it in a really unique way let s take a look at that clip and florida governor ron desantis now said he wants to give unvaccinated cops a five thousand dollar bonus to move to his state nypd minneapolis seattle if you re not being treated well we ll treat you better here you can feel important needs for us and we ll compensate you as a result so cory governor desantis is essentially creating a hamster dam if you ve ever seen the wire for law enforcement in florida in kind of a safe zone um for the for the a coveted safe zone and is it really safe though it sounds like the opposite well that s what we need to discuss right and i think that there s this huge debate going on in this country or awareness of labor shortages across the country i think that the most significant labor shortage we may be facing is not at the docks which is important and maybe not with truck drivers but with police officers yes absolutely and what s driving this is a couple of things one is we ve had a a historic uh crisis of um understaffing of police departments um coming out of covid and june of 2020 and then on top of that you have these vaccine mandates which are hitting police departments uh that were already understaffed and most notably you have seattle where they have something on the order of almost 10 percent of their police force that are out of work right now in an already understaffed police department and then where we live in new york in a couple of days the mandate hits uh officers where they have they have to have gotten their first shot and last time i checked there were only 71 percent of officers who had gotten a shot which means there could be a huge shortage here in new york city as well a huge crisis cory yeah it s a huge crisis and it s a crisis that governor desantis is definitely taking political advantage of and i just think that there s no bottom to how low this governor will go to appeal to the far right i mean he s literally trying to poach cops from other states unvaccinated cops mind you and get them all to collect in one area i mean that s like a super spreader event waiting to happen it doesn t really make any sense when you really think about police officers they put themselves on the front lines they re some of the people that are most vulnerable to covet 19 and we ve already seen a lot of police officers over the course of the last year die from covet 19 in fact four times as many cops have died from covet 19 this year than from gun violence so this is already a very vulnerable group and desantis has really taken advantage of that and it seems like he s willing to put the health and safety of both those cops and just the citizens of florida in general at risk just to be the top conservative in the country yeah this seems like a big signaling moment uh and the politics of this are extremely dicey uh and it s not just on the right uh let s look at uh john oliver commenting on this just a few days ago constant refrain we hear from cops every time they kill an unarmed black person is they should have complied with commands because as long as you comply things will supposedly go well but that only seems to work one way because when officers are asked to follow simple rules or face consequences a not insignificant amount of them flip their __ so you know what if an officer wants to quit over this __ let them let the individuals who clearly don t care about public safety stop being in charge of public safety corey i hear what john oliver s saying there is a major contradiction here worth pointing out and i think it is really important for officers for example like in chicago to hand over their vaccination records when it s mandated they need to comply with the law to state the obvious but at the same time i think he s being a little flip about what it means to have these officers not show up for duty i m pretty sure john oliver is not uh carrying the weight of under policing on his shoulders yeah i mean this has been a significant problem with the left right you ve got extreme factions on the left that have been screaming defund the police and the reality is a lot of them that are saying that are these political elites who live in really good neighborhoods and they re not going to have to deal with the fallout of defunding the police and what that actually means it s the communities of color and these poor communities that are actually going to have to deal with these high crime rates as a result of defunding the police and there s a lot of polling data to suggest that most black and brown people i think like 81 of them don t support defunding the police they simply want police reform so this has been one of those talking points on the left that s very flawed if you ask me right and uh more data backs up your claims because axis came out with a poll over the weekend that reflects the fact that crime is going up in this country but the two different sides of america the political divide have very different views about what s driving those increases in crime so republicans believe that the increases in crime are because of the defund movement by a majority democrats don t believe that democrats believe that it s loose gun laws that are driving violent crime and a very small percentage of republicans believe that so you have two different stories cory about why we have rising crime in america well of course you know the right and the far right are going to take that defund the police and make that the focal point of their argument you know seattle s a good example of a city that did defund the police and now you re seeing the cop crisis there you re seeing higher crime rates there but also you got cities like nashville and houston that increased funding for police and they still saw significant increases in their crime rates so there is not necessarily a definite correlation between defunding the police and higher crime rates but to the left s point i mean gun sales did increase exponentially during the pandemic so it is very possible that that s contributed to the rising crime but really crime rates rise and fall in different cities for different reasons and i don t think either side really understands the nuances of what causes those increases and decreases to crime and so right now we re just playing this sort of kind of political back and forth instead of really taking a more focused look at what s really causing the crime rise that we ve seen in the last year or so in this country but getting back to the vaccine mandates i mean do you feel that that s something that s appropriate for police officers across the board is that something that more cities should go into even though we re seeing shortages in cops these days yeah i do i am a supporter of vaccine mandates i think that i would carve out certain places like seattle where if you re already facing a massive crisis in staffing for your police department i would be careful about these mandates but i think in the vast majorities of cities including new york we could we could bear the the cost of some police officers not showing up and i say this to somebody whose mom is a city health worker and i m i was really glad to see that vaccine mandate because she s of a series of risk factors i wouldn t say more my mom will get mad at me that makes me worry about her in covenant so i m glad that her the people around her are vaccinated absolutely and i mean i totally agree with vaccine mandates as well i do believe that when it comes to police officers and police departments it should be an individualized thing every office should operate based off of what they feel is best for them i think if you get to like you know 89 vaccinated and there s people who have legitimate religious exemptions or legitimate medical exemptions i don t see the need to push that last little bit especially if weekly testing or bi weekly testing is a part of the equation i think that that definitely needs to be balanced but it s just a story we re going to have to continue to watch i think the next story we re going to talk about is alec baldwin terrible tragedy that happened involving him everybody s talking about it but some people are really talking about it in the absolute wrong way the worst way possible yeah and uh as background uh there was this movie called rust being filmed and alec baldwin accidentally shot and killed a woman named helena hutchins who was a director of photography on the set the gun was supposed to be cold meaning it wasn t supposed to have a bullet in it but it was hot which means it did have a bullet in it and somebody else got shot as well director i believe um and it s a tragedy uh the reason why we re talking about it is not because you know gun violence on the set of hollywood is particularly interesting for us but uh the reaction to it was notable because it revealed the worst about us as a society you had total politicization where members of the right were gleeful including donald trump jr who was trying to sell a t shirt about guns don t kill people alec baldwin kills people jd vance was calling on twitter to reinstate donald trump s twitter account so that he can comment on baldwin and then you had some people who i don t know what their politics are but who were sharing old audio of baldwin fighting with his daughter suggesting that he s a hothead who probably deserved this there was uh there were also people who were talking about union organizing on the set and within an hour were claiming certain things about who was responsible and who wasn t and i just think that this was a really sad moment where we all just need to step back and instead of positing our theories about it just kind of let people deal with the tragedy yeah to me it was just absolutely disgusting the way so many people on the right handled this just because they disagree with alec baldwin s politics or because he played trump on snl to take the tragedy the the tragic death of this woman one of and and also one thing people got to understand is how few females there are that work as cinematographers in hollywood so to lose one in this way is tragic enough and then to take that and try to politicize it when this has absolutely nothing to do with politics it s just really disturbing and disgusting for so many reasons not to mention i mean they re really attacking alec baldwin because he s been an outspoken liberal he s been an outspoken critic of trump but isn t that free speech i mean these are the same people that try to defend free speech no matter what it is but the minute they hear free speech that they don t agree with they try to go against it and again it s just a really terrible tragedy that s just been politicized in all the worst ways by the right right and you know if you were to politicize it uh i think the fact that this shooting even happened shows that you know guns might be dangerous yeah should probably be careful about who gets them right it actually proves the left s point a little bit i mean their whole thing is they re going against alec baldwin because he s been a proponent of gun uh of gun control but at the same time the fact that he with a gun discharged it in an unsafe manner it actually proves that guns are dangerous in the hands of the wrong people which is the whole point that the left has been saying about gun control i mean i m a gun owner i m not necessarily for strict gun control but at the same time this is this is not like they re not proving the political point i think the right thinks they re proving right now right i think there are two things that happens when these times of tragedies happen on social media the first thing is uh that each side tries to fit the facts into their preconceived narrative and i think this happened in the boulder shooting yes uh with much different effect which uh the you know members of the left in that example uh rushed to call the shooter white when the shooter it turns out wasn t one because they just desperately wanted the facts to fit whatever argument they wanted to make instead of and just imagine being a victim or a victim s family and having to deal with all these people commenting who don t know what the after talking about this issue while you re dealing with such a big tragedy and then there s another phenomenon that happens when these shootings happen which is uh everybody becomes an expert you know i remember or any tragedy right when covert first happened everybody was an epidemiologist when they uh the election results were being contested in the days after the november election everybody was an election expert then just couple months ago everybody s an expert on afghanistan and refugees and now everybody s an expert on workplace safety in hollywood yeah we went from foreign policy experts in september to hollywood safety experts in october it doesn t make any sense and it just really points to just the toxic nature of social media just how toxic it s gotten and how we re just willing to take any little issue that has nothing to do with politics and then politicize it for our particular side well speaking of experts who don t know what they re talking about i m gonna try to make sense of this new revelation i think first reported in vanity fair that the national institute of health which is the organization that employs dr fauci recently admitted that they re funding risky virus research in wuhan province and why is this important because dr fauci went in front of congress earlier this year and gotten back and forth with rand paul in which rand paul was trying to press fauci to admit that there were funding research like this and fauci said that they didn t do you still support funding of the nih funding of the lab in wuhan senator paul with all due respect you are entitled entirely and completely incorrect that the nih has not ever and does not now fund gain of function research in the wuhan institute do they find doctors and so i want to pause here to say that there s a very complicated debate happening about whether fauci lied and what he knew and when he knew it and it all revolves around this terminology called gain of function meaning like there s a term to describe the exact kind of research that makes a virus more potent and this may or may not have technically been felt uh fell within that definition but i think the bigger point here is uh fauci when he was in front of congress knew what rand paul was getting at are we funding research to make viruses spread more fast and spread more fast to humans and fauci if he knew that this research was happening should have admitted it in that hearing because he knew what rand paul was getting at or if fausti didn t know that this research was happening why the hell does dr fauci not know that we re funding very dangerous research around the world so either we re incompetent or dishonest either way it doesn t look good no it doesn t look good at all this is a really complicated story uh it involved the nih and this other organization called eco health alliance and basically the research that they were doing and apparently there wasn t a there was a lack of communication with funding from the nih yes funding from the nih the nih didn t know precisely all the things that eco health was doing and apparently some of that research dealt with making viruses stronger and that s what this term gain of function deals with and really this points to in the larger context of everything we ve been hearing that that sort of kind of conspiracy theory that that covet 19 was man made that it was a result of a lab leak or possibly even something more sinister and that s something that we ve been hearing from the right especially the far right for more than a year now and originally that was like a theory that you couldn t touch everybody you said that oh no that s bonkers conspiracy theory and now it seems like there may be some evidence that there s no maybe not necessarily what the right is saying but there may be some truth to the lab leak theory yeah which is really concerning because facebook used to ban uh people even making that claim which should make us very concerned about restrictions on free speech in uh social media platforms and they had to they d walk that back the people who were talking about this a lot tend to be people who both believe not that the the wuhan theory is plausible but that it is a certainty which i think the evidence certainly doesn t support that yet i think it s just plausible and there s certainly a lot of murky stuff happening around sharing of data about what happened and all that that should concern us all but in contrast to a lot of those people i want dr fauci to be a credible figure i want our public health institutions to be credible and i think this is so frustrating because it just makes it really hard to build any trust that our public health institutions are doing the right thing well it s hard to have an honest conversation about it because so many on the left because fauci has become such a major figure with them they don t want to admit to the possibility of him lying or not knowing what he was talking about not to mention you compound that with the fact that there are people on the left that don t want to criticize anything to do with china right because if there s any criticism of china that starts to get linked to this anti asian sentiment which it s possible to criticize the government of china or possibly this wuhan laboratory without criticizing chinese people in general and i think that that s something the left has to understand is that you know we can have this conversation about this lab leak theory and what possibly happened without you know being racist towards asian people right and and it s also possible that there will be racists making some of the same arguments that you re making and that complicates things so you don t want to be like hey i m in with the racists yeah but you also don t want to let perhaps the most ill liberal country in the world uh a a country that s been stonewalling us in an investigation into the worst pandemic we ve seen in our lifetime we don t want to let them off the hook either so it s kind of a bind yeah it s a really complicated situation we re just gonna have to keep an eye on it coming up we have got a story that is going to astound you why are conservatives screaming let s go brandon at grocery stores and sporting events all across america we re gonna find out coming up next welcome to another edition of what does it mean where i decode the political memes that are making the rounds on facebook instagram or wherever you get your mass misinformation from what does it mean applause when you look at a meme is it truthful what does it mean today we take a look at a meme trend so powerful that it was recently mentioned by a congressman on the house floor more on that later but first let s take a look at this first meme so this masterpiece was recently shared by senator ted cruz in it we ve got three people playing will of fortune one with joe biden s face great photoshop skills by the way so the wheel of fortune board spells __ joe biden with a missing u and i and the caption reads i d like to solve the puzzle please let s go brandon hilarious ravi do you get this meme at all i get the __ joe biden part of it but who s brandon uh interesting question that s why i m here to make some sense of this because this really doesn t make any sense without the backstory so let s back up and talk about let s go brandon it s a trend taking over the conservative interwebs and it has its origins in something really strange and really stupid that took place a few weeks ago at the talladega super speedway in alabama a young racer named brandon brown won his first ever nascar race and in addition to the mass cases of people surviving alcohol poisoning something else happened there that would change the direction of political discourse in america for years to come oh my god this is a dream come true wow applause oh my god dad we did let s go applause oh my god it s just such an unbelievable moment brandon you also told me as you can hear the chance from the crowd music let s go brandon so if you couldn t hear it whale the rowdy crowd behind young brandon was chanting __ joe biden but the reporter either hard of hearing or trying to cover for the intoxicated bunch behind her decided to proclaim that the crowd was instead chanting let s go brandon now the right wing in their infinite wisdom has deemed this a key example of fake news a prime example of the mainstream media lying to our faces about something we can obviously hear and see and this event has inspired a host of new memes as conservatives across the land embraced the phrase let s go brandon as a new tongue in cheek way of saying __ joe biden while the maturity level of the right has sunk to a stunning almost prenatal new low at least their comedy skills are slightly improving right ravi i think so i left okay well that brings us back to senator ted cruz and this super professional meme this elected official shared on twitter so now we know let s go brandon really means __ joe biden and that pretty much explains why photoshop joe there is saying let s go brandon to solve this puzzle uh funny stuff right ravi i think so i mean yeah to me the only funny thing about this meme is the fact that biden has the lowest amount of money of the three contestants i mean that was a really nice touch at least whoever made this meme can you know they can math and this isn t the only let s go brandon meme out there this next gem taken from a parody of ryan reynolds new film free guy depicts biden saying let s go brandon while nothing but chaos ensues behind him it looks a little bit more like the summer of 2020 but you know it s open to interpretation who s the president then uh right and coming in with the classy touch we got the aoc met gala dress meme but oh wait look what someone did let s go brandon on the dress instead of tax the rich just so funny ravi isn t this just the best i think this is fair game corey unfortunately though let s go brandon has now left the world of the internet and is bleeding into real life there are let s go branding billboards amazon is selling let s go brandon flags and that s not all folks there s a song american screaming let s go brandon wow i haven t lost that many brain cells since the last time i walked past an outdoor wiz khalifa concert and if that wasn t bad enough a u s house representative bill posey of florida belted out let s go brandon at the end of his speech on the house floor they want you to help put america back where you found it and leave it to hell alone let s go brandon i yield back weak fist pump bro but it s nice to see that civil discourse is still alive and well in our nation s capital the washington post even had to print a retraction after it mistakenly reported that a georgia crowd during a donald trump junior rally burst into chance of let s go brandon when in fact the crowd was obviously screaming __ joe biden that s like the same thing that happened at the nascar race i mean the words __ and let s don t even rhyme how does this mistake keep happening so ravi is this meme tren funny or just plain sad i think in general this is fair game i think that this is america and saying __ the president is it s pretty american i think it s an american thing to do now i do think that if you re a member of congress i feel a little differently yeah and i also don t want to own whatever crazy __ goes along with this meme because i m sure there will be some racist things thrown alongside eventually right i think on the face of it some of this is really funny and it s kind of meta in a way that the left really isn t capable of right now yeah i mean but do you feel like this is just the downward spiral of civil discourse i mean um to to the right screen any where further left to go down though uh right is there any bottom i would say to the to the to the right s credit uh when donald trump first got in office uh there was a rapper late great nipsy hustle made a song called __ donald trump and so it was very similar to this trend except instead of like you know masking it they just actually say it __ donald trump but you didn t see politicians saying that you know democratic politicians saying that on the house floors well i remember when the representative said you lied to obama yeah and not too long ago that was the big scandal yeah whereas now they re essentially saying __ joe biden just like floyd the house on the floor yeah it just seems like they really can t handle uh losing that election yeah but on the face of all of this stuff i think it s okay and i think you could both laugh at it even if you re a biden supporter to say this is part of the political discourse that we have today and you could laugh and also still be a supporter of biden that s a valid point up next i sat down with congressman richie torres and he s going to talk about how he differs from progressives on key issues coming right up you told the new york times not too long ago that there s a sense that the media diminishes you do you mind just elaborating on that for us well there s a temptation to define me in relation to others and i feel like i have a compelling record of public service a compelling personal story and i have a right to be judged on my own merits on my own terms rather than in opposition to someone else yeah so i do resent the attempt to reduce me to a caricature or fit me into a larger political narrative um i insist on being my own person you know that article in many ways was juxtaposing you to the squad and i guess that s what you were saying was that that comparison is what you re just constantly getting one thing you said in that article was that you re practical and not ideological but i think based on what i know about you i wouldn t say you are without ideology but is it is it that your your ideology is the pragmatism i m not without ideology but i am without ideological purity test and for me the central value of progressivism ought to be progress and progress is measurable in the real world yeah so like one area where i am at odds with progressive orthodoxy is is my support for charter schools right if there is a charter school that enables students of color from places like the south bronx to academically outperform students from wealthier school districts i would see that as a manifestation of progress whereas there are others who would oppose it purely on ideological ground so i i m a progressive in the empirical sense of the word in the sense of valuing progress in the real world you know i would never let progressive purity be the enemy of real world progress why is it that white progressives have this disconnect from the rest of the party and why does it seem that that they re getting their way at a policy level you know for instance the house cutting federal funding for charters most recently like why are they winning that battle on the policy level there s a racial divide in attitudes towards charter schools right you know wealthier white progressives are much more skeptical ideologically skeptical about charter schools whereas people of color in places like the south bronx tend to be more supportive tend to be more willing to send their children to charter schools you know the reality of politics in america is that wealthier white progressive activists have more agenda setting power than black and brown people who represent the rank and file and core of the democratic party yeah and therein lies the disconnect and the vanguard is often unrepresentative of the masses and the vanguard is quick to speak for the masses without actually speaking to them you know if there are families in the south bronx who have determined that charter schools are the best option for their children who am i to tell them otherwise like who am i to tell them that i know what s best for your children i know better than you do yeah but that s not progressivism that s paternalism i m not indiscriminately supportive of charter schools but i care about well regulated charters i care about well whether a school is a traditional public school or charter school what i ultimately care about are results you know are we creating progress for students particularly students of color in places like the south bronx and there is a distinction between the michigan betsy devos model of charter schools which is for profit and deregulated and that to me is an utter debacle right and which is not what we have here exactly right whereas the new york city model is carefully regulated not for profit and is the gold standard uh that should be followed across the country yeah with strong results yes and strong quality control right you touch on this bigger set of themes where whether it s that david short interview with ezra klein or just tons of data coming out of the 2020 election there s this bigger conversation happening about a disconnect between the elites of the democratic party and the so called rank and file whether it s our rank and file or just working class voters generally and it seems like this question of charters and the disconnect between wealthy white progressives and black and brown families is part of a larger conversation we need to be having as a party about who s calling the shots here uh and you seem to be kind of at the tip of the spear here look a party whose members range from bernie sanders to joe manchin it lacks ideological coherence right it reminds me of the will rogers quote i m not a member of an organized political party i m a democrat um but like our greatest strength is diversity and our greatest weakness is diversity and managing that diversity has been a challenge as everyone is witnessing in real time in washington dc right but we have to address the divide that you re touching upon you know one more issue is defund police i think most rank and file democratic voters are practical and not ideological and would prefer to reform rather than defund police and here s what i resent if you re a white progressive activist from a wealthy neighborhood like park slope and you re advocating defunding police what happens if there s an outbreak of gun violence gang violence and youth violence right you live in a wealthy neighborhood so you re going to be comfortably ensconced right in an ivory tower right whereas it s people of color who will have to live with the consequences of your of your public policy choices and so that that s that s what i have a problem in fact what i would recommend is we should have neighborhood by neighborhood referenda and close the police precincts in those neighborhoods that that vote to defund police but yeah so if there are bastions of democratic socialism out there that wish to defund police let s close the police police out in those neighborhoods but i can assure you that no one wants to close the police precincts in mind and what s interesting about this is that if i were to be in most sort of progressive circles and i were to say i m pro charter and i m anti defunded police people would call that conservative whereas that those views seem to be largely held in the pockets that are some of the most democratic pockets uh in this country if you live on the echo chamber of twitter then yes right you would be correct in that characterization and so how do we break free of this echo chamber you know i think like obviously like people like you speaking out but what else because it feels to me like when these june 2020 moments happen the debate is immediately hijacked by a very small segment of the progressive coalition and there isn t like a consistent pushback that seems strong enough to give people cover or maybe not yet you know i think elected officials have to remind themselves that twitter is not the real world it s an alternate reality it s often a distortion of the real world a visible vocal minority of vanguard can be easily mistaken for the majority on twitter it can be a powerful platform for raising consciousness about progressive causes right you re one hashtag away from inspiring a social movement b2 i can t breathe black lives matters at the same time you know twitter can be a cesspool and the need for approval the need for retweets and likes can have a distorting effect on what you do as an elected official yeah that there s a sense in which instead of controlling twitter twitter can control you such an impressive guy right cory oh yeah absolutely she s definitely a rising star in the democratic party should definitely be getting a little bit more press because that s the type of candidate that could really get some votes outside of new york city right and uh we talk about so much more in our extended interview which is available on our youtube page uh he talks about affordable housing and he gets in greater depth on a number of issues including what s stopping democrats from attracting enough voters so you can check that out on our youtube page awesome looking forward to that coming up next a scandal at yale law school we ll be right back so ravi one thing that you didn t really mention in your opening when you were given your bio was that you actually went to law school didn t you yeah i went to yale law school but i don t really talk about it a lot i mean did you do anything yeah because i haven t practiced and my parents and you know my grandparents got on me about just never taking even the bar exam oh wow uh but you know interesting you should mention this because last night i had this weird dream where uh you know how like there are all these cancellations happening in the public uh i had this dream that i was a judge and i was adjudicating in like the public square like what should happen to these people who are so called cancelled and it was just really bizarre interesting you are about to enter judge ravi s cancellation courtroom the people are real the cases are real the rulings have no legal standing whatsoever order in the court all rise for judge robbie s cancellation court prosecution please state your case your honor today s case deals with something as old as time itself racism specifically racism in america we re dealing with a yale law school student a second year law school student who should know better by the way and he decided to throw a party for a constitution day nothing wrong with that right the only problem is his email that he sent out inviting people to this party he decided to frame this party as a trap house party he invited people to his trap house themed party where there would be popeye s chicken along with basic bitch themed american snacks counselor what s a trap house well your honor a trap house is a house in which people distribute and sell illegal narcotics but that s not the point the point is the term trap house has been closely associated with the african american community as a stereotypical term linking them to drugs and poverty essentially we believe this student was trying to invite people to a blackface party because the term trap house has been used as a code for blackface parties on college campuses for the past decade or so we believe that s also why he included the term basic __ themes tax implying that this would be a party for white people in which they would be in blackface and think about the compounded issue of offering popeye s chicken at a trap house thing party i mean papa s chicken the blackest of all the chicken restaurants clearly this was a racially insensitive email that was meant to trigger the black students of this university we believe this student should be punished for this your honor we believe he should first have to issue a formal apology to all of the black students on campus but we also believe that if he refuses to issue this apology that he should be removed from all of his leadership positions on any group on campus counselor what s the race of the student in question well your honor he s half cherokee half white fully racist counselor for the defense your turn your honor you know i might just be a small town lawyer from the sticks but when you grow up on a dairy farm you can smell the bull from a mile away and that s exactly what the prosecution is trying to push in this courtroom today bull your honor there was nothing inherently racist about my client s email he used the term trap house that is a commonly used term by his generation the the rappers of both the white and black persuasion use that term all the time think about the podcast chapel s trap house that s a left wing commie podcast that calls herself a trap house and nobody refers to it as racist i submit to you your honor exhibit a these lyrics i found on lyricgenius com went from sweating the blade now the stew is in the trap house yana those lyrics are from a rapper named g eazy who is as white as snow if a white rapper can say trap house and it s not racist then how come my student who is only half white can t say trap house in an email without being racist it is just a ludicrous claim we believe this is a witch hunt against my client because of his inclusion in the federalist society that s something the prosecution didn t mention did it he s in the federalist society this is a conservative organization and conservatism is under attack on college campuses all across america counselor one thing i can t get over is this reference to popeye s chicken next to the reference to basic __ snacks can you explain that popeyes is one of the closest restaurants to the place where the party was taking place nothing racist about it and as for the basic __ themed snacks this was a constitution day party he was simply just joking that the snacks were going to be american thing by saying they would be basic __ thing it was a joke your honor counselor why not just issue an apology it really doesn t cost that much if we start apologizing for every little term we use in the email what s next shawna we believe all the charges should be dropped from my client and we believe an apology is issued to him because this has been a very stressful time for him people calling them racist this man is not racist he just simply likes popeye s chicken okay thank you i ve heard enough i want to thank both counselors for the defense and the prosecution the function of this court is to solve problems that people in society aren t able to solve on their own and i just don t see a role of the court here i think i was persuaded by the defense uh especially in the evidence from is it g eazy uh and chapo trap house that the term trap house is widely used enough that i can t impute motive here and then we have this popeye s chicken situation and basic __ snacks and i would say this is the harder question um but i just don t know what the motive of the student was in question i certainly could be persuaded one way or another but i haven t heard anything definitive to say that this was out of malice and then we get to the remedy i just think that a insincere apology is worse than no apology at all and so i would hate for the court to force an apology in a situation like this and i would just encourage the students to talk this out wow ravi you got some really __ up dreams i mean what was that i mean yeah i got to stop taking cbd before i go to sleep man yeah i was like in it but it was like i was like two different people at once that s that s really weird you should stick to melatonin but uh coming up next the virginia s governor s race is coming up and how will critical race theory affect it music a strange thing is happening in virginia probably the key battleground in 2021 the percentage of voters in that state who rate education as their top issue has nearly tripled in just the past few weeks and as a former school principal and superintendent this initially got me really excited perhaps we re going to have the substantive discussion about how to improve kids lives and how to help our schools but that s not what s happening what s happening is a debate around this concept that you might have seen all around the news this concept of critical race theory the battle of a critical race theory in our public schools has become a major flash point in one place in particular ground zero the virginia governor s race that brings us to our segment what s actually happening with critical race theory what s actually happening what is this critical race theory or crt as they say well its origins go back 40 years to law schools around the country and it was really like a term only used in academic journals and it meant uh that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice but it s something embedded in our legal systems and in our policies and so an example of this is in the 1930s there was this concept of redlining when the government would draw lines around areas that they deemed poor financial risks and often they were drawing these lines based on race and then banks would refuse to offer loans to black people living in those neighborhoods and those patterns live on today even if today s policies are facially race blind and so the concept seems pretty cut and dry right no the problem is when people talk about critical race theory today they re grouping many things together new terms like white fragility and anti racism old terms like identity politics culturally relevant teaching diversity equity inclusion and they re also including a teaching of america s historic floods and you need a degree in sociology or history even to keep up with all of this and some of these concepts overlap and many reasonable people can disagree about each of these different things so for example i think it s really important to teach about america s complicated history and its dark history but i m also pretty skeptical of the book white fragility for instance and don t think that belongs anywhere near children the problem we have is that neither side of this debate is being particularly disciplined or precise when they talk about this concept so i m going to attempt to demystify this concept for you as the audience and i m going to start by talking about the critics of critical race theory it s mainly on the right and when i see the critics of critical race theory i mean the critics of all the things i just talked about and how they lump it together by and large their biggest criticism is that when people use all these terms they focus on group identity over universal universal shared traits and values meaning they focus on race and gender instead of what makes us american what makes us live in the same community what makes us have certain belief systems they also are worried that there s discrimination against white people embedded in some of these theories they also worry that there s a relativism about the way we use language and that all terms that we use are somehow instruments of power where the most extreme version of that that i ve seen is that some people are advocating that the teaching of for instance the scientific method is racist because white people came up with the term uh they also believe that uh some of these critics that teaching people some of these concepts means you re teaching them to hate america so those are just some of their criticisms and what an example of the the you know in in the minutia what they re worried about is in cupertino for example there was an elementary school where a third grade class was forced to quote deconstruct their racial identities and then rank themselves according to their power and privilege i mean what could go wrong here and to be clear that example i couldn t find too many examples of stuff like that i think what is uh i think a bigger issue when we look at that sort of ranking of all the different terms are theories about how we use standardized testing and data to drive instruction which are sometimes linked together with critical race theory and ben shapiro recently went on bill maher and talked about this let s roll that clip the fifth largest school district in america clark county just decided that they were going to lower standards with regard to testing because they wanted to alleviate disparities in outcomes that is an outgrowth of critical race theory can you draw a straight line to it yes 100 because when you say that the meritocracy is an outgrowth of white supremacy and then you suggest that i m somehow denying that slavery took place or that your great great grandfather was a hero because i m saying that i want people tested when they are in school to see if they are good at school there s a lot i disagree with ben shapiro on but actually he and i are probably in agreement on this particular criticism which is that there are ideas that are prominent on the left sometimes being grouped together with critical race theory as a terminology you know ibram candy for example who wrote how to be anti racist they re they re critics of standardized testing of the use of data to drive instruction or even acknowledging a so called achievement or opportunity gap who call all those ideas racist meaning acknowledging the realities of our schools and i m with the spurs of the world who think that we need that standardized testing we need that data we need to acknowledge the gaps in our schools in order to improve them that s an important debate but the problem for the shapiros of the world and the critics of critical race theory is that uh when people talk about doing something about it they go too far so young can for example who s the gop nominee for the virginia governor s seat says he wants to ban critical race theory and in his ads he has for instance one of his most recent ads he had a woman who has uh historically advocated for banning the toni morrison book beloved from schools and there are 27 states that have introduced legislation to quote ban critical race theory and eight states of past legislation to ban it and some of these laws are really crazy in wisconsin for example they passed a bill that prohibits the use of over 90 items and terms in schools you d need a phd to even interpret this law florida s school board issued guidelines saying that you quote may not define american history as something other than the creation of a new nation based on largely based on the universal principles stated in the declaration of independence translation uh you can t teach anything other than the aspirations of this country it s like saying if you re in a relationship with somebody that they can t acknowledge any of your actions they can only talk about your promises that s absurd and tennessee the state where i used to run schools had a terrible law as well they were banning teaching anything that could lead an individual to quote feel discomfort guilt anguish or any other form of psychological distress because of their race or sex so these are problematic laws and some people who are critical of some of the sub components of critical race theory so some people like me who ve been critical of white fragility and anti racism etc people like thomas chatterton williams and camilla foster took to the pages of the new york times to say look we have some problems with some of these other concepts but these laws are problematic because a fair reading of our history is going to make people uncomfortable and we need to preserve the ability to tell an accurate history of the united states and they talked about how if this law was on the books in germany they wouldn t be able to teach for instance about their terrible history with the holocaust and and have their students uh acknowledge that history and do something about it and so these laws go too far they are dangerously imprecise uh and it is much more common for states and districts to mandate what is taught that s what we call curriculum standards versus what isn t taught which is really unusual to to prohibit things within the classroom uh and this term critical race theory it s grown to include such a broad category of things that it s basically meaningless so when people use the terms you really need to drill them down as to what they actually mean by it and the tragic thing here is that somewhere in this debate there s an important discussion about how we discuss privilege how we group students together how we think of diversity but the laws being proposed here go way beyond any of that to mandate an inaccurate reading of american history and to sidestep the important conversations we should be having as a society yeah i just learned a lot i mean i don t i didn t know what critical race theory was uh but some of this just seems really extreme from both sides i mean when you ve got the left trying to teach third graders to rank themselves based off their power and privilege that sounds ridiculous but it also sounds ridiculous for tennessee to pass a law saying that you can t talk about anything that makes you uncomfortable uh about race or gender i mean that means you can t talk about women s suffrage that means you can t talk about slavery or anything like that it just doesn t make any sense i think both sides are just taking this way too extreme and they re just using our schools as a battlefield for their culture war right and i think in this case i was not able to find enough examples to merit i think a hysteria around this like although there are examples of pedagogy like that third grade class that i didn t like um it doesn t seem like there s this epidemic that s being described and i think what s really going on here is that the suburbs are these battlegrounds so there s this county i didn t mention called loudoun county in virginia which is the critical battleground in virginia and it s one of the most affluent counties in america but it also happens to be the county in virginia that was the last to integrate and it s the site of all this stuff and i don t have enough time to go into it but essentially i think the gop strategists view an opportunity in the suburbs to push on this issue and i think that s what s going on and i think if they re successful on tuesday you will see this as a playbook around the country absolutely well i think that brings us to the end of our first episode thank you all for sticking around with us for so long uh make sure to subscribe to our youtube channel check out our podcast on spotify apple music wherever you get your podcast from we re going to be doing this every

approved the boundaries of their new congressional districts and as of tuesday 46 lawsuits have been filed in 17 states challenging the new maps on grounds of gerrymandering and racial discrimination my home state of alabama happens to be one of those states go figure where a special court in january ordered legislators to redraw their map since it diluted the power of black voters there the supreme court thought otherwise however voting on monday to halt the special court s ruling and reinstate alabama s new map um so for people who aren t aware of what gerrymandering even is ravi do you want to give like a brief description of just what this is and why it s so problematic yeah every 10 years we give a census in this country and you know it just means we count our population and you know population shift and so based on uh that data we have a process called reapportionment which means that we re divvy up the congressional seats in the country and so some states may gain some states may lose and and because of that also individual districts within states also may lose or gain populations and so you have to redraw congressional lines uh within states and so that process happens after the census every 10 years and it s supposed to be a basic process where you have these contiguous districts so like you know like that the district should make some kind of sense like maybe they re a square or something but over time the you know the partisan nature of our country being what it is people have begun to game the system the political parties and so when one political is in part one one political party uh has control over the designing of maps versus the other they re gonna maximize their gain and they write they draw all these crazy lines to to just and they re now using sophisticated statistical uh um uh models and and experts that can basically maximize their hand and minimize the hand of their opponents and there s some states where this is like absurd and i m just gonna make up these numbers like like where you can like say maybe it s a 55 45 state but one party will get 70 80 of the seats because they re that good at this and so this is a big problem and what s happening is you re seeing fewer and fewer swing districts around the country where dave wasserman who s like an expert on at the political report put the number of swing districts in this country at somewhere between five and six percent of districts yeah as of 2022 with this redistricting it looks like it s 23 out of 318 districts are competitive which is pretty ridiculous for a country that s almost 50 50 so that s just seems entirely undemocratic at face value yeah it s insane when it comes to this particular map in alabama there was three judges on a panel that basically said this map is you know it s gonna dilute the voting power of black voters there you only have one district in which black voters have power and they basically wanted them to redraw the map to give an additional district that was basically what they call a minority majority district where there were more people in it that would have been able to help decide you know the fate of another district in alabama who was going to be uh representing that district two of the judges on that panel were trump appointees so this wasn t even a super partisan thing they were just literally like this is just not right the way you ve drawn this map is not right now the supreme court has uh basically you know halted that decision they ve gone back on it was a five to four vote uh chief justice roberts actually sided with the liberal judges on the bench in that um what s really interesting is that there was a congressman out of alabama in mo brooks he s a big trump guy and he said it was wrong for this lower court to try to force alabama to draw maps based off of race but alabama already draws maps based off of race and i m going to do this quick enough i m going to show you how alabama has already fully done that we have a prop here today this is this is alabama and this is its congressional uh districts now i want you to pay close attention to the seventh district here this is the only district in alabama in which african americans have any significant voting power a lot of these counties right in here are what they call the black belt these are counties in which there are majority black uh voters in all of these counties but there are also majority black populations in a lot of the cities in alabama that are nowhere near any of these counties yet they ve all been grouped into one convenient district look at the shape of this thing why does it cut up look how far down south these counties are yet this district cuts all the way up into here into oh what is that birmingham this particular city has a large african american population its suburbs do not have a large african american population so its suburbs are right here in this other district yet its city cuts right in there included with all these counties that are nowhere near it also look they also decided to include tuscaloosa that s where the crimson tide play if you re a college football fan some of their residents are a heavy they have a heavy african american population there but only in certain parts where they cut it in to this little sliver right here and then look how it comes all the way over this part of alabama has nothing to do with this part of alabama and yet they cut it all the way over to get just a little tinge of montgomery south montgomery where a lot of african americans live this shape makes no sense this is not a shape this is like look how many sides to this this is like a dodecagon or something like this is so many sides to this and this is the way this is like gerrymandering a physical like a physical description of what gerrymandering looks like when they cut these districts just to include all the people into one district so they have no power over any of these other districts insanity if i ve ever seen it well that was a great description and i think this is the problem with the the modern system right now and and why i support efforts i think one of the the voting rights bills that democrats were pushing on the hill would have been they had voting rights yeah would have would have uh banned partisan gerrymandering and i think what s interesting is that democrats have been saying that they were going to be the victims of gerrymandering in this cycle but all available evidence suggests that alabama aside uh by and large democrats have actually won so far the redistricting battles i think the american public has lost because you know districts like my home district in staten island uh was a true swing district it s i think it s changed hands four or five times since i was a kid from one part of the next and uh it is uh it was a state where you had to really make an argument and you had to be on your toes as an elected official you had to really serve your population and pay attention to their needs and now it s been redrawn to make it significantly more democratic not necessarily safe but way less competitive and right now basically the way where we stand is that republicans had control heading into this process of way more state redistricting processes but they they ve come out so far losing seats from the redistricting process so one analysis we saw has democrats at the moment of being plus 11 in adding democratic leaning seats in this process now we only have 32 states as of this data that have wrapped up their process so so much can happen in the remaining states but because of certain states like new york that were so aggressive in redistricting out republican states and because of this phenomenon around the country of republicans inexplicably doing way more incumbent protection than they probably should have democrats i think have come out way stronger than they expected heading into this process and i think the problem here is in any one state nobody wants to unilaterally disarm nobody wants to say i m going to be the responsible one and create the commission all that i mean it has happened but it s not as widespread as it should be i think we need national reform that s the only way we can get through this and fix it it s worth noting that california michigan idaho arizona colorado and washington have all done either like both parties together redistricting or totally non partisan commissions that they have independently had redraw and it s doable states have done it on both sides of the political aisle and i think that you know this is where my andrew yang kind of supporter comes out here it s one of his platforms in the forward parties the idea that we should have these independent redistricting commissions because 80 of districts are considered safe we have a 90 re election rate and we have the lowest approval rating of congress ever so this is just not a system that s working for people and i think even like going back to your point corey of like the racial elements too it s a really sad reflection of the fact that our two party system has incentivized politicians to look at people based on immutable characteristics of groups that they can win or that they just can t even think about or it s just it s so reductive what this ultimately does to people and to voters and i think it s really it s it goes back to 1812 but that s not a constitutional element of our country and it can be changed and i think it should be yeah i have an example of this too which is my my district was staten island plus like bay ridge and bensonhurst which is actually like culturally a very similar district the new district that s proposed will now include park slope sunset park which is actually where i was born now there are there are a few places in the city as different as park slope and staten island and one outcome of this could be there are there are rumors that bill de blasio is going to be jumping into this race for this district now there could not be if you went to the the candidate factory and you were and you set you put the settings on most anathema to staten island values i don t think you could design a candidate more unpopular with staten islanders writ large than bill de blasio but there is a world where he could emerge in this primary because it s now added a bunch of like park slope types like him to the electorate and a lot of the primary electorate will come from that and so it could be that he emerges as the primary candidate even though the vast majority of people in this district cannot stand the man the guy murdered a groundhog on staten island and covered it up he eats pizza with a fork you know what i m saying this is a guy who used to show up to work late in the after you know seven o clock you would work out at the ymca in brooklyn and then he d show up to work late and set down his bluetooth and during the pandemic with the lockdowns here this is a working class a lot of city workers a lot of teachers firefighters police they hate him uh and so to me this is an example of and i saw it in nashville too is like they split that district now and nashville might not get its own representative now um because you could have people like representing the the excerpts of nashville instead of the city itself like it s absurd and people are being disenfranchised around the country absolutely it s just a terrible process and de blasio with the groundhog like what was just a just a murderer now allegedly alleged murder but there s there was there was a youtube slaughter yeah manslaughter okay they weren t they were totally upfront about this and and like shame on you staten island zoo for how you participated in this a great zoo uh everybody should go visit it but i think they they allowed themselves to get dragged into politics here well let s let s hope he doesn t re emerge as a candidate because that would just be yeah we don t have positions on campaigns like the only unifying issue of like everyone ever that like the only thing americans can agree on or at least new yorkers is that we all can t stand de blasio like we don t take a position on the actual election we just dislike him yeah let me put my c3 hat on a second and say he has not announced there any campaign so this is totally this is totally fine if he does then we have nothing to say about it yeah we have absolutely nothing to say about it and yeah so we re neutral in that race i could you couldn t tell or super new super nature music

debate a show for political eclectics i m robbie gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlatt well corey what do we have today a lot of interesting things to talk about today leaked documents from the botched afghanistan pull out don t paint the biden administration in a good light we discussed the implications then the debate about the permanent child tax credit continues in washington we look into the pros and cons of that policy new meta analysis from a group of economists suggest the most divisive covet 19 measures lockdowns were not effective at preventing significant death we dive into that research but first things first a lot of fires going off in the nfl right now former miami dolphins head coach brian flores has accused his former team and the entire nfl of a culture of racial discrimination allegations of sham interviews and payoffs to lose games are among the most explosive claims flores makes in his class action lawsuit now racism in the nfl has been an open secret for a while now right now just one of the nfl s 32 teams has a blackhead coach while 70 of the league is black flores is just 40 years old so he s putting his entire career on the line to call this out ravi i know me and you we read this entire lawsuit uh this entire complaint what can we make of all of this yeah we were reading through this yesterday as it came down it reads almost like a history of the nfl and it goes beyond anything that s happened recently and goes all the way to the founding of the nfl and catalogs a history of racism and discrimination that seems undisputed in many ways like there are certain things in this document that are absolutely allegations that have yet to be proven and then there are things that are just historical facts and i think one thing that s fascinating is a lot of people who are just casual sports fans can describe uh what happened in baseball like the negro league and how there were all these amazing players who were deprived a chance but they don t really know that history of the nfl and i think this lawsuit is going to help people understand that history and the nfl if i were the nfl i d be very concerned and flores in this lawsuit he starts out just coming in hot right away this is from the right at the beginning of this complaint document he says in certain critical ways the nfl is racially segregated and is managed much like a plantation it s 32 owners none of whom are black profits substantially from the labor of nfl players 70 percent of whom are black the owners watch the games from atop in nfl stadiums in their luxury boxes while their majority black workforce put their bodies on the line every sunday taking vicious hits and suffering debilitating injuries to their bodies and their brains while the nfl and their owners reap billions of dollars so he s going at them full frontal and i think what makes this interesting is that flores is undisputably a great coach as somebody who s a buffalo bills fan we re in the same division uh when he was fired i tweeted before this lawsuit how and i don t really tweet about the miami dolphins very often or ever but i tweeted that this was a crazy firing because he s a really good coach i mean it s great for the bills that we don t have in division anymore but it was baffling then and now he makes a lot of allegations about what exactly was going on behind the scenes and if i were the nfl i d be concerned yeah definitely and one thing that i m confused about that i m wondering if either of you guys have any insight into um is that the situation in terms of minority hiring seems to be getting worse in recent years um just going back to like 2017 or 2007 to 2011 26 9 of uh head coach hires were of minorities and now that s gone down significantly do we have any sort of sense of why that might be happening well a lot of that just deals with the racial discrimination that he alleges in this lawsuit he talks about the fact that a lot of blackhead coaches are not given the same opportunities as far as leeway like if they have a bad season they often get fired a lot more a lot easier than someone who had who s white who had a bad season uh there was an example of uh i believe it was um jim codwell yeah with the colts uh he went to the super bowl and then two seasons later had a pretty bad season and was just fired and so there s a lot of examples like that there s other examples of the texans head coach was just let go after a pretty bad season uh and i think he was only there for one season wasn t he yeah yeah yeah and i think i i don t know the answer as to why it s getting worse i think there s a lot of attention on this rule called the rooney rule which uh this was a rule that was instituted in 2003 and it seems to be a born of good intentions like johnny cochran was involved and there was this you know there was there was a lot of attention on the fact that at the time there had only been six black head coaches uh by 2003 and they instituted this role that started with a requirement that every time there s a head coaching vacancy you have to interview at least one black person for that position and now it s expanded now you have to interview two people of color they have to be external candidates there s a whole process that the league has set up where they actually help organize the process and it s now trickle down to assistant positions gm positions front office positions and as you point out we are not in a good place even after all that you have one black head coach currently in the nfl at least as of this taping there could be somebody announced in the next few hours and they in this lawsuit uh call out the rooney rule so they re basically saying this very you know maybe a well intentioned rule actually is playing out in ways that are discriminatory right now and and harmful they say that the rooney rule is uh not working because management is not doing the interviews in good faith and therefore it creates a stigma that interviews of black candidates are only being done to comply with the rooney rule rather than in recognition of their talents so uh and they give examples saying you know there are lots of situations that he s alleging and other people are coming forward to share their examples of where there s a vacancy they re called in to do these interviews and the decisions already been made but they re only doing it because it s the rule so they re wasting these time their time and i think what s getting floor is incensed is that he s being called into one interview after another where he s not even being considered for the position but they re doing it just to comply with this rule so it s kind of this classic good intentions gone wrong situation and there s one colorful example where john elway you know the hall of fame uh quarterback who s now the gm or now president i think of the broncos showed up late to this interview seemed like he was hungover clearly didn t give a __ and i think he s i think flores had a lot of these uh you know experiences and then he just lost his __ well let s talk about maybe the reason why he lost his __ and that s the bill belichick text i mean what do you make of this from what it looks like bill belichick texted uh flores saying you re kind of almost congratulating him for getting this for potentially getting the head coaching position that was open to the new york giants and then uh flores had not yet gone to his second interview yeah with the giants and then it seems like belichick takes it the wrong yeah this is like a who s on first situation so if you don t know football bear with me here bill belichick great one of the greatest if not the best head coach of all time which means that he has a coaching tree they call it meaning like a lot of these candidates come from him because he s trained them you know think of him almost as like a steve jobs or something you know where there s a lot of his proteges going to start new companies uh he happened to have two proteges named brian one brian dayball who s the was the former offensive coordinator of the buffalo bills and then he had brian flores uh who we ve been talking about here brian dabal gets the giants job but it s still not public yet brian flores is still interviewing for the giants job bill belichick texts and it seems uh he texted brian flores thinking it was brian dabal saying congratulations on the job and flourish is like wait what and then bill bill belichick had to basically apologize and that s the beginning of the complaint is that text message uh and i think and the reason why they share it i think this is not obvious to people trying to think about this from a legal perspective the reason why they share that text is because it they re offering this as proof that the decision was made before flores wrapped up the interview process and that is that is significant from a legal perspective because the weird intersection of this rooney rule means that race is explicitly a factor in who gets to interview right like because they have to interview uh people of color for these positions uh but uh if you re if it s if you have to interview a person for of color for a position but you ve already made up your mind about who that person is before they come in that means that you re basically offering up people of color as like a sacrifice to the gods of equity and diversity or whatever uh which means that you re bringing people in especially to not give them a job because of their race yeah that s and it s a it s a tricky complicated legal argument but here just as from a legal perspective as somebody who s been a part of a couple of big lawsuits like this nothing that will play out in the dollar figures of this but i ve been a part of at least one multi million dollar lawsuit the discovery is what the nfl is going to be afraid of here it s not going to be the ultimate outcome i think this is going to be a six fig as a massive multi million dollar hundreds of million dollars if not billions dollar settlement but uh the reason why the nfl is going to be really concerned here is because now everybody mentioned in this document is going to be subject to depositions and there are some things in here that are super inconvenient for the nfl uh one one thing you know beyond the race questions which there are just some damning damning allegations in here uh in here and i know corey you did take talk about that this morning uh one piece outside of the race context but it does have a racial component is that the the owner of the dolphins who stephen ross who also owns related companies anybody who s a member of equinox that s the company owns equinox uh steven ross allegedly asked flores to tank games like lose games on purpose and was trying to give flores a bonus to do that and the reason why is because in the nfl the team with the lowest record gets the top draft pick the next year and flores refused and so if that s true that s like goes to the integrity of the game so uh the nfl is not going to want that to come out and so i think this is where the nfl is right now i think that they re in really big trouble here they re not going to want to go to discovery they re going to do everything possible to settle this case and the question is what does flores want like what from a dollar figure what what s what suffices who else joins this class action lawsuit and then he lists a couple remedies to the hiring process uh as well which i think the nfl will probably quickly grant just because i think for them the dollars and cents are a bigger concern i mean it s sad to say this but i thought the nfl would be more concerned about the fixing games than all of the racial discrimination because that ruins like you said the entire integrity of the league now some people are going to look at this story and they re going to say well you should hire the best person for the job you shouldn t have anything to do with skin color so what do you say to someone who comes with that attitude and does and doesn t see the relevancy here of the sham interviews and everything like that and just thinks that flores is blowing this out of proportion so i want to i want to live in a world where people s immutable characteristics don t matter in a job interview the problem is i don t get to create a world where everybody s on an equal playing field right away so when you have a situation where only one of 32 nfl coaches are black that s not an accidental situation if you re flipping a coin 32 times in a row and it comes up tails 31 out of 32 times that means that something more than chance is going on here and that there s not an equal playing field and so from my perspective as we talked about in the supreme court situation i don t like litmus tests um i don t think it s it s great for our country that we have them but at the same time the absence of taking race into account when race has been taken into account for hundreds of years means that in a way you you are acceding to the history right like in this situation where you know the owners are like is there a black owner i don t think there is a black owner right is that an accident right so like when you when you have a situation that s so stacked against a group of people and um and and you have to remedy it somehow right and like is the remedy just to do nothing and hope that it all plays out and and becomes equal one day or do you do things to actually put your finger on the scale to fix those things i think that s what makes makes this tricky is because attempts to fix it like the rooney rule can sometimes backfire uh sometimes if you pick somebody because of their race then you know they feel like they re not legitimate because you know you ve announced that ahead of time we talked about the supreme court but then if you don t pick them at all then they don t have an opportunity at all so you re kind of in this catch 22 and this is where i get to people this is where i get upset with certain people who called this out like matt walsh tweeted the following he said this is pretty great the nfl put an affirmative action policy in place requiring teams to interview black coaching candidates just to check the box the giants followed the rule and now a black coach is suing them claiming that the policy is somehow racist against him amazing now i agree that this rooney rule backfired but what i would want to know to matt walsh citizen is what are you gonna do like when we live in a world where we showed the supreme court stats the other day you could talk about any aspect of american life whether it s wealth who are the ceos who are in the halls of power who are the head coaching candidates who are the gm s who are the owners it is overwhelmingly tilted in favor of one race in this country a country that happens to have a deep history with slavery like is this an accident no so what are you going to do matt wall citizen we can agree that the rooney will backfire but what are you going to do to help fix this problem is my question you know when i hear stuff like the matt walsh tweet it s just it s just infuriating because no one like brian flores i don t want to speak for all african americans we re not a monolith but no one like brian flores is going to put his career on the line like that unless he really felt like enough was enough yeah he had a future yeah i absolutely absolutely still had a future i mean there are still some open positions right now that he could be considered for but he probably won t be because of because of his lawsuit and like when you re in that position when you re an african american and you re in a professional position you never want to think oh i m not getting promoted because of my race you never want to think that but when you have the qualifications and you see someone else getting promoted who doesn t quite have the qualifications or your qualifications are equal you have to think to yourself what else could it be and i think that s the position that flores is in here yeah i would just want to know like if we just stopped all race based uh discrimination hiring practices everything like we don t we don t have affirmative action so we don t have the remedies but we also don t have this discrimination how long does it take for races to become on equal footing and i think that is a question that divides people ideologically i actually think there s a good faith discussion amongst people as to like how that would play out the problem is like you need a lot of things to happen before that we live in that world there s one other thing to point out here which is the nfl on the day that this uh this um complaint was filed immediately put out a statement saying that this was without merit i find that interesting because there s a lot in this document uh and there s no way they could have known it was without merit like for take example the stephen ross allegation how does the nfl know within an hour or whatever of this complaint coming out that stephen ross didn t have a uh a a an incentive for people to tank games like so it calls this into question and um i and i m not completely sure if this is true or not but i heard peter king on the radio this morning or yesterday saying that when there was a st louis lawsuit um where it s the city of st louis sued the nfl over stadium relocation when they moved to la the nfl also called that uh without merit or something equivalent immediately and then guess what eventually uh settled for hundreds of millions of dollars so i think the fact that they say it s without merit almost tells us nothing about whether there is merit in this case there s two interesting things to note um one that flores lawyers i don t think they ve named two but have said that on both the charges of having sham interviews and on being paid to lose games that there are other coaches that have said that they ve had the same experiences and another interesting thing is that like the nba doesn t have this degree of disparity in their coaching and stuff so there maybe there s something specifically happening within the nfl and and there s a model of another league where that s not the same situation but i ve definitely been on the sidelines on this conversation well there s a theory about the nfl is like the theory about the nfl is that and this is bill simmons i ve heard i m not sure if he s the original proponent of this theory but he says that you know nba is more new money like kind of people who are younger and they re kind of more tech innovators and stuff like that so there are people who think a little bit differently than a lot of the old money that s in the nfl that s at least a theory about what what makes the two leagues differently and then the second is that the nf the nba is way more uh empowering to players because when you have five players on the court at a time and they re not wearing helmets they re way more recognizable symbols each player matters more so like a lebron james or you know god help us to kyrie irvings of the world have more power and control over their destiny and the league s destiny and so like when something happens they can like you know what happened during um the floyd protests they can grind a game to the to halt with with a little bit of coordination between players who who know each other coordinate with each other and that s largely a good thing and so they demand certain things and lebron james is an example like i think he was instrumental in ty lue becoming his coach for example and you see this time and time again is that they have way more decision making power over who becomes their coach and you don t see that much as much in the nfl well hopefully some things in the nfl will change we re going to move on to our next story here new revelations about the u s withdrawal from afghanistan paint the biden administration as woefully unprepared axios shared leaked white house documents this week that suggests even basic details of the operation were still being decided just hours before the taliban seized the afghan capital fast forward to now and the humanitarian crisis everyone warned about is coming true the u n now says more than half of the population there somewhere on the order of 20 million people face extreme hunger millions are fleeing sounding alarms about a migrant crisis so any way you look at this even if you agree with the withdrawal this hasn t gone well at all what do we make of the the fallout here from this afghanistan debacle that s still still happening months later i mean this war is singular you know you think about the fact that you know i was a freshman in college when 9 11 happened and my brother went off and fought in afghanistan and i have a bunch of friends who went out and fought there and then i lived long enough to then go on and start a school where my kids were old enough to graduate and fight in afghanistan and that s crazy and so this war has been going a long time i was a fly on the wall back in 2009 and 10 working in the obama administration when there was a big surge debate and all of that and man it felt like we were rounding the bend back then but obviously this continues to go on and i think the sins are so numerous it s unbelievable so you start the clock back in the 80s when we re arming the mujahideen against russia we basically did nothing to contain the consequences of that after we and russia left uh and they basically assassinated their leader taliban came to power uh and then we then jump in full force after 9 11 and then i immediately basically within a year go to war in iraq and that becomes our central focus and we take our eye off the ball in afghanistan and then once we realize we re screwing things up in afghanistan we then apply a nation building the clear whole build strategy from iraq to afghanistan without really a full accounting of the differences of the two countries you know one country being for all of the flaws to say lightly under saddam hussein it was still a bureaucratic state with way higher literacy rates and had a history of infrastructure and government functioning in its own crazy saddam way afghanistan was never that it had none of that infrastructure it had super high illiteracy rates and was basically a collection of different warlords controlling different parts of the country with a huge pakistani influence on its border and so we screwed that part up and then there s so many other things but then you have this 2019 piece deal that trump pushed with the taliban which basically gave the taliban a clear sense of the clock that they needed to wait to run out so that they could take back power then biden comes in announcing 9 11 as the date which is like sure like that that s like a random date right like uh he picks it for symbolic reasons not strategic and tactical reasons and then doesn t put in the time resources attention to make that work um and then uh i think the seeds to the demands of president ghani who basically didn t want the u s to start evacuating people early because they didn t want to create a sense of chaos we over uh we were overconfident in the afghan government and the afghan army uh and then biden completely screws up the the evacuations and then gives a speech in august uh basically saying the buck doesn t stop here like was not very clear about what he would have done differently the mistakes he made etc and this is where we find ourselves it s like one mistake after another and biden is the commander in chief the buck stops with him and he was the most recent fuck up in a long series of fuck ups that our country s had uh in afghanistan yeah and i think the humanitarian side of this is hugely important because now half of people in the country are experiencing extreme levels of hunger hundreds of thousands are fleeing we love translators and aids and americans there women and girls all their rights essentially are being rolled back slowly it s really tragic and i hope especially as a libertarian that this is kind of the nail in the coffin of this idea that we can go go and get ourselves involved in some very complex situation and fix it and somehow like evangelize our model of of democracy or life somewhere else and um this reminds me of a friend of mine faisal who started this organization called ideas beyond borders he s from iraq he grew up reading classical liberal attacks and very like the american constitution and john stewart mill and now he s sending books to afghanistan to actually teach people these values because you can t just go have a military presence in a country and then pull out and expect that somehow our our values are going to uphold afterwards and so i think that that issue of education and assuming that the american model can be extrapolated all around the world is just completely broken and we have a really grotesque history of covert action and getting involved in all these different conflicts that we really have no business being in and i hope that this really changes the the national mores around doing something like this again in the future absolutely you made some great points there um about educating another country about democracy before you just try to force it on to them but something you said uh ravi about the fact that we were over confident in the ability of the afghanistan government to hold back the taliban and not everybody was there was a general frank mckenzie he was critical of this uh doa agreement that uh trump did with the taliban did not think that was a really good plan and was also very critical of biden s assessment that the afghanistan government would be able to hold for as long as it was or for as long as they thought it would be so there were people uh in the u s military at very high levels that were critical of both of the actions of these presidents and it seems like this was an instance in which the political civilian leaders of our government weren t listening to the people on the ground as much as they should have been and that may have resulted in why this was such a horrible blunder for the bad administration yeah this is a textbook case for me as to why i like my government to take on a limited amount of things and do them really well because if you look at what the bite administration was doing in their initial days it s like you ve got covid going on they re passing all these bills on the hill they re trying to expand this expand that make this promise make that promise and in the end you can t do all these things and i think this is this is where i differ from a lot of alternative media where like there s a lot of you know some of our friends in alternative media which there s not an issue they don t find a conspiracy in it s like you know ukraine is a military industrial complex and this and that like having served in government it s more like the keystone cops a lot of times it s not like there s this group this cabal sometimes there is like but uh it s not always this like this you know this villain you know petting their cat in some you know dark castle somewhere like it s often just a group of people who are overwhelmed not coordinating well not on the same page and making huge mistakes and then not owning up to them which is what i see here and uh and it s really sad to me like this is this is a group of people who depended upon us and no matter what we think about the origins of that war or going all the way back to the 80s like these are human beings who are suffering and and i there s got to be more we could do even today yeah i listened to an interview of a um soldier who was deployed to afghanistan who broke down in tears talking about when he was talking to these translators on the ground when they were involved in the war he was saying like like we re here for you like you re we re gonna pay you back for your help and to think now that those people are left and now entirely endangered and enemy territory for having helped our country is just so tragic i think we can agree this is quite frankly the biggest mistake of the baton administration so far so political implications here i mean not not as many people are talking about this as much i know this axios article is what brought it up for us to talk about but is this something that going forward midterms 2024 is this something that biden will have to answer for when it comes to the politics of all of this yeah i think if you look at his polling over the summer this was one very critical piece of a large slide that he took over the summer obviously kovid was part of it there are a lot of things that were part of it and uh you know he deserves criticism for this like i i ve definitely laid out the blame to a lot of people but during the trump administration i was very critical administration for not you know owning uh the results of their own policy and constantly passing the buck and doing what about isms or whatever and i think democrats and liberals need to do that with biden he is the person in charge and he had the ability even after he made those mistakes to get up and give a very different speech on august 31st over the summer and he did not and i remember that there was this viral video that went around by jocko willink um you know the the veteran who s now like a public intellectual who s written a lot of interesting books and he basically gave this alternative biden speech where he was basically saying like this is what it would sound like to take responsibility now i don t agree with everything that jocko said because i think in there he was like i m going to hunt down everybody who does yadda yadda and i m like you can t really follow through on that now like there s not an appetite to send more american troops down there to keep fighting that war but i did like the first part which is essentially i __ this up and i like leaders who were just do what bill belichick did in his text message be like yeah i __ up like you know like yeah but yeah should have sent a text message to uh like uh the president uh ghani karzai he could send the wrong president to the wrong president yeah i mean i can t fix it anymore uh impeachment do we think i m gonna get beats over this you don t think i mean no matter what but you remember the threshold for impeachment is so high you know is it though well to impeach to remove sorry oh yeah well when it comes to removal yeah but i mean if the republicans took the house and the senate would that be on the table i think it would be i don t know if this would be it it may maybe some like hunter biden laptop conspiracy or something but who knows now on to the continued debate about the child tax credit democrats say the credit which expired in december of 2021 reduced child poverty by 30 but republicans are pushing back saying the program amounts to a new welfare program the price tag on the tax credit law is hefty around 185 billion dollars a year and those numbers don t sit well with the fact that the u s has just surpassed 30 trillion dollars in our national debt for the first time ever so let s dive into this is the tax child credit or is the child tax credit i should say something worth saving uh ravi i know you have some strong opinions about the child tax credit and i me and my son would like to hear those well okay just for people like me who don t have children this is a tax benefit that s granted to americans uh for each qualifying dependent child right and uh what s interesting is that it s fluctuated in terms of who qualifies over the past few years there s been a lot of debate about this it started in 1997 actually as a republican idea uh and has now um and that was for those people who weren t around back then there was this big debate about welfare and work requirements for welfare and you had republicans who favored you know tax incentives because it s people who are working and that and they wanted to incentivize people working in reward people are working putting that debate aside this tax credit has fluctuated in terms of how much money you can make and still qualify for it and for me and this is at the center of the debate between mansion and bennett manchin wants to make this uh low i think 75 000 qualifying for a family and bennett wants to the whole household i think right yeah 75 for the whole household for families so the so this is where i come down on this is that number one i think our tax code in general is too complicated i think that it s right now like every one policy sounds sensible but then when you build it all on top of each other it s like one of those houses that if you ve ever been somewhere where like you build a little piece at a time nothing matches each other and nothing makes sense nothing works i would also say that it is a weird system where you have people you have a world where potentially a 50 000 a teacher making 50 dollars uh is subsidizing uh a family making three hundred ninety nine thousand dollars uh for anything in my opinion and so uh whether they have kids or not that just seems like a bad public policy result and so to me uh i want children and poverty to be taken care of i think there are many different ways you could do that i think that the way that this has been designed has um just leads to some really weird results yeah i think it s worth noting that historically this has been a republican uh kind of policy and a democratic policy and i i don t personally have any problem with it i don t really like taxes in the first place as a libertarian and so in any way that i can put money back into people s pockets to actually spend as they please rather than through government programs that end up you only getting getting cents on the dollar by the time the money actually reaches the person through different uh and like handout systems um i mean i m i m for the child tax credit i don t know about this specific iteration but i also just more largely feel that our tax system is so convoluted and bureaucratic and ridiculous i mean it s it s millions of words long there s literally 1 7 billion hours spent by americans every single year trying to figure out what the heck they owe 31 billion dollars spent just to figure it out to pay other people to do it this is from 2019 and if you take in the cost of compliance plus the work hours that are lost in the economy a george mason university study estimated 600 billion dollars loss which is insane um and there s also a study that s worth mentioning that s kind of funny um money money magazine sent a fictional family s tax information to 46 different tax experts that were considered really like high end accountants and they got back 46 different estimates with thousands of dollars difference between and so i m i m gonna say i m a flat taxer uh flat rate on this on this personally um because i think that our system is just so broken and convoluted and we just add more and more provisions and layers and it s just more and more confusing so you re saying people are actually losing hours of their life hours that they could be working by just doing their oh 100 i mean it s it s so ridiculous and so confusing and especially if you live in a place that adds even more layers on the local level it s insane we we spend 1 7 billion hours as a country trying to figure out what the heck we owe that s insane and that s unpaid we re paying this money to to the government and we re doing a job for them it s stealing our time so taxation really is death taxation impact i will stand by that one cory also like uh you know to answer your question about my message for your child uh the let s focus on what you said about the the deficit 30 trillion the 30 trillion dollar deficit and i was looking at this because the the the federal reserve is talking about raising interest rates right which means that um the amount that the u s actually has to pay out and our debt will go up there are estimates from the congressional budget office that net costs will reach 8 6 of gross domestic product of just uh our debt and our interest rate on our debt um to the point where we ll have 60 trillion in interest rate payments over the next three decades so essentially i just don t want him to pay for our decisions today you know i want him to have that money in his pocket um but more important than that like we re we re borrowing from future generations here now now this isn t where i would start this debate like i actually if i m rank ordering good policy versus bad i would probably go after things like mortgage interest rate deductions on yachts which is currently a policy uh and so there s so many bad tax deductions and i think this is my problem with the tax code where i m with ricky is like the more wealthy you are and i think especially once you start to hit the hundreds of thousands of dollars like 500 000 plus you start doing all these tricks so you re not paying as much taxes as you should we ve all seen the numbers but i also think and this is where i m going to be really unpopular and to be clear i want to have kids i want to get married but i do want to look out for my single people out there who don t want to have kids they get absolutely screwed in the tax code so here s just a couple of examples of where single unmarried people who don t have kids and don t plan to get them just get absolutely screwed so uh first of all they don t get any tax breaks couples uh get to jointly file and they get deductibles um social security goes back into the system after you die if you re a single person whereas it goes to your spouse if you re married if you re married you can claim your spouse s social security at 65 and then wait for yours to accrue uh married couples can put two people on an ira whereas if one spouse does not work for five years the other spouse can make contributions into that account but if you re a single person and you don t work for a few years i can t my family they re not allowed to contribute uh into my 401k or my my ira spouses can withdraw from an ira for medical and educational purposes and not face a 10 penalty but single people face a 10 fee and that s before we even get to kids right we re talking about the the child tax credit uh the fact that you know single people pay to the public school system which they should but like thank you single people for doing that we don t they don t get that enough and then you have parental leave policies in companies you put this all together and say wow like being a single person is freaking hard like and all i have to hear is how hard it is to raise children in this country uh and so you know i just want a little bit more respect for my single people out there i think every single person if we did something like the child tax credit as a child will benefit from their family having more money even if they eventually become a single person well yeah in order to be a person i think you have to have i don t know i guess i m not i m not feeling as bad for you as you are but you know let me give you some things okay so first of all on average if your child does not latch on mines didn t a hundred and eighty dollars per month for formula and that s in alabama it s about two hundred and forty three dollars a month you know what my equinox membership is uh uh 240 a month for formula in new york 70 to 80 a month for diapers um 25 to 300 a month for toys pacifiers and other child related __ it is very expensive to take care of just a little person like a toddler like a little child then when they grow up they have golf lessons and tennis lessons and baseball lessons and t ball lessons you have to pay for all of that stuff then they become teenagers and then they get a driver s license then you have to pay for their car like it is extremely exciting hear you and it lasts for 18 years but then with my generation it lasts for 30 years because we don t move out of our parents houses until we re at least 31 or 32 so i m sorry i just don t sympathize as much with the single person argument because it is way more expensive to actually take care of a human being so here s my thing on that though uh and we ve got our producer lucy back there who s about to bring a child into the world and and here s my thing you know lucy just bought a nice car a grand cherokee uh and and here s here s the thing hold on hold on uh when we re talking about thresholds like four hundred thousand dollars like i don t wanna subsidize her like upgrading to a denali you know what i m saying like like yes i want you to have money for all those things uh but i think when people start getting up to three four hundred thousand dollars yeah of course like that s absurd to me this should definitely be a cap i mean i don t know if 70 000 should be that cap but there should definitely be a cap but i think you know when you look at what other countries do other more developed countries in europe and how much they spend on child care it s insane i mean the the facts really speak for themselves yeah there s that spain situation um from our research that i found really fascinating is that you had from 2007 to 2010 spain introduced and then eliminated cash transfers to new mothers so this wasn t a tax credit and the data is really interesting we have an underpopulation crisis potentially in this country many people say uh and the data at least suggests that this cash transfer system actually incentivized new births it actually decreased abortions in the country and then when they cancelled it um births went down uh and so it is definitely one if i m being serious and kind of take off my skip bayless defend a position hat here for a second and say all right this could be if we if we did better in taking care of parents in this country especially on the lower end of the income scale that could help us uh with the sort of demographic time bomb that we have i would want to marry it with smart immigration policy because i think that you know births are isn t the only way out of this but yeah like i if i m being serious um which i still am single people i m still your advocate but uh i do think that this is a tool in toolbox norway spends 29 000 a year on toddlers iceland 24 dollars a year chile spends eight thousand dollars a year chile yeah is that how you pronounce it i m not gonna say chili um um i think it s chile uh eight thousand dollars a year lithuania eight thousand dollars a year we spend five hundred dollars a year on toddlers in the united states yeah but have you have you looked at how much we pay per pupil here in new york for education of a child that s new york it s like six zillion dollars per child here i would much rather see a system where we give tax credits and allow the parents to spend that money however they want and however they see fit for their family rather than the government doling it out and with programs that sometimes aren t effective which i know we re about to talk about one of those very programs with pre k so let s talk a little bit about that new research finds that pre k programs could be detrimental to children the study published found that children who attended state sponsored pre k were 74 more likely to be diagnosed with a learning disorder by sixth grade compared to their peers who did not attend pre k that s pretty scary let s talk a little bit about these findings what is wrong with the pre k system here in america well this is coming out of tennessee s system it s a vanderbilt study and they held the study back for two years just to double check it because the findings were so crazy um but the kids that literally did not go to pre k at all did so much better it s almost double the learning disorder difference and also school rule violations it was 18 5 for the control group versus 27 3 percent for the group that was actually kept in pre k but initially when they went into kindergarten they were doing better the kids that had gone to pre k and then this flipped as they got older their development was just off and not as as favorable as the kids that were literally at home which is just really incredible and this is the first study of this kind where we have a control group that didn t do anything at all and it s pretty astonishing so they were when they went to pre k and they went to kindergarten they were doing better in kindergarten first they were doing better but then as they got older they started developing these issues yeah so i mean my take on this is that what happened was they were being taught like early kindergarten stuff and so when you get to the first fundamental things like you re gonna have a little bit of a head start but they lacked the experience of just being at home being a kid going out and exploring and i think in a lot of these pre k settings they re just sitting around quiet being yelled at not really allowed to get their energy out and just enjoy or bond with a parent or play with siblings outside and so i think this is not a good look for this governmental pre k situation yeah and i think the fact that this is tennessee is notable because it s obviously where i ran schools and gee i didn t know that i ll give you and i think like let me paint you a picture of what this looks like i think this is a question of pre people act like pre k is some solution to the larger system that stands outside of it but it s going to be a reflection of the same problems that the system already had and so just to give you a sense uh we have a a guy named elias lukes who works for us and he was the first student ever attended the first school i ever started and when i went to go visit the middle school when i was just scouting locations to start our first school when i went to go visit the middle school that elias would have gone to i was with my buddy john little who s now on the school board for nashville we went to go visit that middle school and it was like an episode of cobra kai there were like fights breaking out all over the school wow no adult supervision anywhere you could find it i go up to the second floor uh to visit the teacher who had arranged the visit and she s got a bunch of kids watching cartoons in the middle of the day in the middle of a school year and this is middle school and so uh if that s what middle school looks like there s why why should pre k be any different for kids like and obviously quality is variable and generally speaking as we talked about here like having kids in a school building i want that over kids not being in school building which is why even with this data i still want to keep trying to make pre k better i wouldn t want to get rid of it but my critique is of of people who just want more and more and more without saying how do we make the stuff that we have better what are the difficult choices we need to make to make kindergarten better first grade better second grade and i think what s interesting here is if this were just test scores they would have argued away i know the people who they would just be like all right that s an imperfect measure but because this includes so many other things including special education services you know and which is notable because you d expect that if kids start earlier you d expect to have fewer kids on ieps individualized education programs because they would be able to get ahead of certain deficits and the fact that that didn t happen in this case is notable and this is there there s been data like this going back a long time so there was a government study on head start in 1965 that found that the program produced no discernible advantage in elementary school performance and i don t want to use this data to say let s not provide programs for kids because i think that s a really bad response to this problem but i do want to challenge people who are responsible for the system to say if you want to expand you need to show us what s different about this than what is already happening yeah i know biden is really pushing it hard for the buildback better build to have this universal pre k i know it s a huge thing the democrats are pushing but like you said if k 12 is broken why introducing people to that at an earlier age how would that fix the problem and something ricky said really points out to me about the idea of taking a child that young and putting them in a controlled environment like that telling them to sit down and shut up i i have a toddler right now and they don t like to sit down and they don t like to shut up and you really can t make them honestly and so i do i can definitely see some developmental issues coming from in stealing that on a child too young i could definitely see the backlash there yeah and this is where i m with ricky on loosening up a little bit in certain cases like like what if we just piloted vouchers more for pre k and in some places this is true and it could be even true that and i don t know enough about how tennessee implemented this but this is where i would want to to do what we do and i know that like this is the this is the ravi bingo card i ve talked about being a school principal let s talk about charter schools because that s what everything s about everything comes back to that card but one of the reasons why i like the process for creating charges is that you have people who have to make a case to a city in our case it was five years every five years we get a charter to to to produce education for kids i would love to open up this process to make it more competitive and there s probably elements of this already in place in this pre k program to say all right innovators come out there we re going to pay you really well like come up with new theories about how to get kids a good experience in pre k make it really worth their while and i think that could help yeah and i think this is really a perfectly timed study to come out because we need to know this before we make some sort of sweeping policy that we have universal pre k and it s really important that we look at this data and we say okay well our public school systems have all these issues that have kind of piled up over time with unions and this and that and all the bureaucratic layers that you have to go through to accomplish anything and this is a new program that we re setting up and we need to make sure that we don t make those same mistakes and i think this is a moment for opportunity absolutely did we did did we all go to pre k here yeah mm hmm i went to pregame too yeah i didn t do well after it either i remember making us do these menial little things like punching holes with thumbtacks into this piece of paper and i d get like poked in the finger every two seconds like it was just doing stupid stuff and i would have been better kind of tottering around outside and like doing something different okay i had a great experience yeah i used to get hit with rulers in pre k i didn t i didn t care what yeah well you know you ll tap on the hand south man now on to our final story one of our favorite topics to talk about here covid lockdowns a study co authored by an economist at john hopkins university found that covet 19 lockdowns may not have been as effective at reducing the covet 19 mortality rate as we once thought according to the report during the first covert 19 wave in the spring of 2020 lockdowns only reduced coveted mortality by 0 2 percent in the united states and europe now the study they conducted is considered a meta analysis which means they assessed a whole bunch of previous studies in order to develop a single conclusion about whether or not lockdowns were effective and based on those 24 studies they boiled their research down to the authors concluded that stay at home orders were by and large ill founded policy now ricky i think it s fair to say that people you know being cooped up in their homes uh like that in 2020 was you know nobody liked that nobody enjoyed doing that uh was it all worth it i mean my stance on that is definitely not i think in the beginning with the two weeks to stop the spread i was all for that and i don t change my stance on that because we had so much we didn t know but um this this meta analysis is based on 24 major studies that found that there was a 0 2 reduction in death and obviously we couldn t know that when we first put these policies in place but we found out a lot more as as time went on like transmission isn t happening outdoors and then you know we still have bands on beaches i was out in la and they were chasing surfers off the beach at 5am going out alone and giving them a thousand dollar citations when that was probably the healthiest thing that a person could have done both physically mentally in terms of not spreading a disease to anyone else because they re outside and there were so many ridiculous lockdown restrictions i don t think this means that all of our restrictions in the first place were ill founded but ultimately i think that we do need to look back and remember that you know suicide attempts for teen girls are up 50 that 200 000 businesses closed across the us in the first year of the pandemic there s learning losses there s domestic abuse there s a ton of unforeseen consequences and you know i think this is a pretty bad result of all those other sacrifices that we we took when ultimately potentially it didn t really save that many lives in the end it s really unfortunate so i think there s this phenomenon in these when these studies come out where people have this motivated reasoning where you re like all right what was my previous position on the pandemic and let me just find evidence that confirms that and dismiss evidence that doesn t and so i m trying really hard not to do this with the study and for people who aren t long time listeners or viewers you know we found data previously some from the economist some from politico that seemed to strongly suggest that places like florida and sweden weren t the catastrophes that many of us had predicted and so there was other data outside of the study i think that suggests that what the study is saying um may be valid but i think when i look at this there is there are some questions i have about this particular study um you know the fact that it s not john hopkins medical school and public health because i think what people think of john hopkins they think of all right this is the premier public health institution and and i don t think this is coming from it s not that s true um the second is it hasn t been peer reviewed yet but the third and ricky i wanted to ask you about this is i ve seen some commentary about the fact that it was a meta study that started with 18 000 plus studies and that got down to 34 and then from 34 to 24 i ve seen some people say hey uh they didn t explain how to go from 34 to 24 what s your sense in reading this study yeah so this is something that i dug into a lot because that figure of 34 to 24 has been tossed around a lot in the media and it goes back to this fact checker who um essentially said that there was no reasoning behind it and so i wanted to dig into that because i think that s a pretty egregious mistake if that s the case and this is coming from three well respected although potentially partisan in a sense uh economists and so i dug into the study and there s five pages to explain how they went from eighteen 000 down to 34 and there s a flow chart and there s all these different steps and you can follow that exactly and then if you actually dig further into the study itself there s five more pages about how that 34 became 24 based on what they call quality dimensions and you know i m not a scientist i can t review whether these quality dimensions are great but they re in there there s an explanation and i think that it d be great to see other people who are experts in the field dig in and make sure that this is not somehow motivated but there s no evidence as far as i can see that it is as somebody who s a layman and i think it s also important to point out that these fact checking websites end up kind of just getting the air of like that s always fact and i looked up the person who had written it who has a studio arts degree like we re we re all trying to understand this data and come at it and then you know as soon as someone says oh i m the the purveyor of facts well then everyone s debunking this study based on this one issue and i i m not going to come down and say oh this study is definitely true or definitely false or there s no motivated reasoning but there certainly is an expressed motivation for um going from 34 to 24 and i think that s important to point out and so if we re just keeping score at home like the claim that they did didn t provide any reasoning from 30 40 to 20 pages is not true whether we don t know like whether those are the right reasons or not no idea one thing i m seeing out there in the public debate on this is the guy who did this study is i think very clearly on record uh with his beliefs right like he has been throughout three minutes yeah calling lockdown s fascist and he s fairly pro trump which is like an economist can be pro trump that doesn t disqualify you from having well that s what the trump association is only based off of one tweet as far as i could find just accrediting trump s due regulatory policies for allowing the vaccine to be developed so quickly which i don t think is i think it was the wording of it that got me where he was basically like it was the juxtaposition of fouchy and trump and basically he was calling out fauci you know i read it differently like i think he was saying that we developed the vaccine faster than fauci had originally predicted because trump had pulled back so many regulations and allowed it to go through with operation warp speed which i think is credit where credits do i m not a big trump fan but that s something that he certainly did achieve um and i also think that yeah there s definitely the potential that somebody s biases get wrapped up in something like this but it is a very expansive meta analysis these are 24 big studies that looked into how effective these lockdowns were and i d love to see other experts in the field that can make sure that someone s biases didn t trickle in here yeah and i think if i m being honest like if somebody were pro lockdown and then had a study like this that showed the opposite i m not sure how many people would be like that s a biased person in the end he didn t collect the data of the individual studies and as long as these were um chosen in a valid and unbiased way i don t know that there s any evidence yet to cast out on this and there aren t any big meta analyses that are saying something entirely different so i think that we need to wait to see more people process this new data and and learn from our mistakes if this is actually true and only 0 2 of deaths were reduced by lockdowns that s really sad considering everything else that happened as a result yeah and i think like like in the end it is interesting that this is not being picked up a ton right like like this john johnson didn t do a uh press release on this and they typically do with all their studies yeah why do you think that is i m not sure him i don t want to get too deep i don t want to yeah i mean i could come up with a conspiracy theory but i m not going to say it well i i will just point out that the first week in march when all the lockdowns were happening espn was releasing the last dance so documenting on michael jordan and so i m not going to say there was a correlation but i mean just if you want to get the truth look to espn that s all i have to say well this is a great conversation we want to thank you all for watching and or listening make sure to

pandemic and the war in ukraine there s been another big story flying a bit under the radar and that s joe biden s nomination for the supreme court katanji brown jackson much of the focus has been on her identity after biden pledged during his campaign to nominate a black woman to the court but jackson has a stellar resume she got her law degree from harvard and she s been a federal judge since 2013 when she was nominated by president obama since last year she has served on the dc circuit court often called the second highest court in the country she served as a public defender earlier in her career which would make her the first nominee since thurgood marshall to have criminal defense experience in the last of her three federal clerkships she works for stephen breyer who is the retiring justice she will replace the interesting thing about all of these accolades that i just read off which are just stellar and amazing and i think she s very qualified for this position is that i haven t been hearing a lot about these accolades in the mainstream media coming from either the left or the right and it just seems that because biden fixated so much on her identity and the left also is fixating so much on her identity and that s being weaponized by the right it just seems like that s become so much a part of the conversation it s i mean i mean you probably saw this when obama was running it s like everybody s like oh first black president but like nobody really talked as much about like why he was so qualified for that job in the first place and i just see that as a troubling trend here uh for instance i have a couple of tweets i just want to point out anna navarro from cnn tweeted that on campaign two years ago at joe biden promised to nominate the first black woman to scotus when vegas he came up he said he d deliver on that promise but damn watching him nominate katanji brown jackson flanked by kamala harris first woc women of color vp is still so emotional and inspiring and i m sure it is um but there s no mention there of any of uh miss jackson s qualifications don lemon says president biden formerly nominates catania brown jackson for the supreme court if confirmed should be the first black woman to sit on the high court congratulations long overdue still no mention of that she went to harvard and how you know qualified she is and again i think it s incredible that the supreme court is probably going to see their first african american woman but when you make it solely about that and you don t at all talk about the qualifications that s going to be weaponized by the opposition to say oh she s an affirmative action hire when she clearly isn t yeah i m with two minds of this i think i sympathize with anna navarro because if you know if you haven t had a single black woman on the court and then you see somebody nominated to it i could see that being an emotional moment right and i i don t i don t begrudge her for saying hey like this got me emotional and the way that like for instance like obama uh you know being you know getting the nomination being president to me was i m not even black but i m somebody who s half uh white and half something else and just like the idea of a biracial person somebody who opposed the iraq war all that like it was emotional to me i get that and i and i and it s a travesty that we ve had such a homogeneous institution this long and as we ve talked about in previous segments it was kind of a bind that that biden was in because i think we generally came down in the kind of incomprehensible belief that he should have nominated a black woman at least this was my position but shouldn t have promised it if he could have gotten away with not promising it which i ll save people the comments on youtube it doesn t make what i just said makes no sense it s not a very courageous stance um but now that she s nominated i do think it s really important like you said to talk about her accomplishments and to make it about that as much or more than anything else and i think in contrast to you know my my now widely shared views about paris this is a no brainer pick she s super qualified i love the fact that she is a former public defender yes there s not enough of that yeah like if you look at just the weight of former prosecutors former doj officials former judges there s not enough of the public defense bar represented in office i happen to to be around one who is the former mayor of nashville carl dean who used to be the city s uh city s top lawyer which included their city s public defender and he looked at things differently given that experience so i think this is welcome i think her experience obviously she s usually credentialed she comes at it from a different perspective she seems like she s going to be um she s just you know she ll be a liberal but she ll be a different kind of liberal potentially on the bench we knew liberal was coming which is why they re like i don t have that much more to say about that yeah yeah and i think um beyond just her credentials she s also a good pick because i think that she s uh probably going to be confirmed or at least more likely to be confirmed because just in june she was nominated to the dc circuit and three republicans voted to confirm her lindsey graham susan collins and lisa murkowski and that will definitely make them look highly ideological to say oh you were you were qualified for this position but now that you re the opposite party s nominee you re no longer qualified between last june and now and so i think that um republicans will definitely be in a tough position given that so that also makes her a good pick on just a strategic level too yeah and i ve been doing some things since our last segment about this and i think there s not enough of the emphasis of the blame on the historic actors who ve gotten us to this place right because i think like so much of our outrage in mind including in during the last segment was like biden making this promise all these people making about identity politics and i and i definitely have my opinions about that but not enough about like how the hell did we get to the point where there wasn t a black woman on the court after all these years you know and like why not enough emphasis on the fact that there was obviously clear racial bias over our country s history i m not saying that s your bias but i m saying like in general like a lot of the people who are getting like especially like people who are trying to criticize biden on this from the right like i m like i m kind of with you on like the promise having some issues but like can we also like really get into the fact that this was a problem in the first place like an acknowledgement of the problem of the lack of diversity like some kind of answer about how you re gonna do anything about it right like what are you gonna do if you re not gonna have a litmus test what s the answer here when you have such an imbalance racially you know for the first half of this country african american woman couldn t even vote or hold office and couldn t even go to the colleges that would be required to get the experience to be on the supreme court so and not that not to mention african american men also suffer from that and women in general also suffer from that so there were barriers put in place for for much of this country s history to make it where the supreme court was a majority uh white male body uh and again of course i have no problem with this pick and i think she s like i said overqualified for for this pick but again the focus on identity the only thing i will say the caveat to that is we did the same thing with harris a lot of the same thing with harris and it comes when you look at her actual track record she wasn t as a a friend to the african american community especially if you look at some of the things she did as d a in san francisco as as you know you would think and so that s all i say i just say that we should we look at these individuals let s look at them for more than immutable characteristics to look at them for their track record their accomplishments everything and weight that along with all of these other things that we want to promote in this country and that s that s really all i have to say

debate a show for political eclectics i m robbie gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlotz well cory what do we have today well coming up biden celebrates one year in office with near record low approval ratings we dive into our theories as to why biden isn t resonating with voters then people are outraged after warriors part owner said that nobody cares about china s repression of uyghurs was he out of line or just telling the truth then ravi gives us his take on why the new york attorney general s investigation into the trump organization is compromised and finally ricky brings us the latest on road back covet 19 restrictions in england but first things first let s talk a little bit about what s going on in florida lawmakers there are continuing their battle against critical race theory republicans advance the individual freedom bill this week it aims to prevent private businesses and schools from compelling anyone to believe they are responsible for the past actions of their race or should be forced to feel discomfort or guilt on account of their race or sex critics of the bill say it amounts to censorship and could lead to frivolous lawsuits i am telling you this is going to open up the floodgates to frivolous lawsuits you re convoluting the what discrimination is you can t say someone feels guilty about other people s discrimination and now they can sue under discrimination his supporters however say the bill would make sure students aren t being indoctrinated i think the most important thing is to make sure that we have accurate history that we teach the dark periods of our history just like we teach the the good periods of our history and at the same time we assure that we re not indoctrinating our students to start off with the premise that we are a racist country now the associated press ran an article on the bill that read florida could shield whites from discomfort of racist past news outlets picked it up across the country though the bill never explicitly mentions white people or even race in that manner so um robin ricky i mean the florida gop is pushing this bill and as far as i know republican party has always been about free speech local control small government i don t see any of that going on with this bill so what is what is going on here you know what s interesting in this discussion is we ve each played a critical role in education system very recently and i was the school principal and superintendent you re a parent ricky you re probably most recently in school um i think just coming out of the university last month so i think we all have experience with the school system i think we bring that lens here and i think as a school principal whose kids were 90 plus percent african american kids in the south i think of this both from the perspective of the kind of discussions you want kids to have within school buildings but also just how easy or hard it is to run a school and i have a few problems with this piece of legislation with that lens in mind number one is that in the legislation it says an individual by virtue of his or her race or sex does not bear responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex and i think what i take issue with here is the word responsibility because if they had replaced it with fault i would have been this this legislation would have resonated with me more meaning people aren t at fault for things that people have done in the past but i think we re all responsible for them in the sense that you know the fault is about things that maybe we didn t have any control about so it s not your fault but we re all citizens of this country and we should want uh to rectify those things because we and and i think that we should in our schools we should be uh that should be like a central point of focus in our civics lesson it s like how do we actually wrap our arms around this difficult past that we ve had and actually make it better leading into the future i agree with that and i also think you know i m i m a little sympathetic to the idea behind the bill because i do i mean i saw myself i was in school being segregated out into affinity groups and sent to different buildings to talk to people of different races about racial issues on mlk day of all days in my high school which felt a little ironic so i ve seen how there are problematic things that are happening in schools but i as especially as a libertarian i don t like this bill specifically um because it s i do think that it s probably constitutional for k 12 teachers because they don t really have a lot of first amendment rights when they re in their duties but i don t like that it s applying to private businesses as well and i especially don t like that it s about how someone feels rather than the intent i think that intent is a pretty clear kind of metric of if i intend to intimidate you based on an immutable characteristic that could be potentially problematic versus if you feel that way and you know i do agree with the idea that this could lead to frivolous lawsuits that are completely subjective um so i don t like the i think there s there s some merit to what they re trying to go after but i don t like the mechanism that they re doing it and i also think that you know school birds and smaller scale solutions are always better in a more decentralized kind of way it seems as though when you look at the language of this build it doesn t mention critical race theory but when it talks about things like making sure people don t feel guilt and that kind of brings up this idea of white guilt and it talks about things about making sure we re not teaching that one side is more privileged than another just because of their race or sex so it seems like they re definitely targeting what the conversation about critical race theory has been about over these last few months i think this question of white privilege is so tricky because any one individual could be more or less privileged than another be you know like there s a low income white for example who s less privileged than me as a brown person in this country uh undoubtedly i ve met many of those people and so it would be insulting to that person for me to tell them that they re you know they ve got some privilege that i don t have like i m sure that there are certain rooms that they can walk into where they re accepted more than i am but i feel like it s often a very sloppy conversation uh and so i don t want that world where we re just telling people in these very large uh you know sort of sloppy and um kind of uh general ways who they are and who they aren t and we re not trying to be more precise but at the same time i also wouldn t want a classroom to be barred from talking about systemic issues that people face or trends or wealth gaps and you know the tie between slavery and the economic conditions that we have today i think that s a part of the country that we live in and i think students can handle that teachers can handle that and i think any effort to shield people from those discussions makes them worse citizens and it makes it harder for us to solve some of these problems and i totally agree with ricky that you know this thing is so vague and subjective you know i was i was thinking about ben shapiro last time i checked his twitter feed it says facts don t care about your feelings and what i m wondering is like what what does he have to say about this law because this is all about feelings and not about facts like as ricky said like it s all has to do with like if if whether or not the intent or even what s in the lesson if you feel for instance anguish and guilt over a lesson over our failures and reconstruction or our dark history with slavery then there s a cause of action here like is that that s kind of what this law seems to imply well manny diaz jr the florida lawmaker who s basically pushed this bill basically was saying that the bill aims to prevent teachers from forcing people to feel a certain way based off of history but doesn t prevent them from teaching these things in history and i just think back to like when i was in the sixth grade i had a teacher who was big on teaching about the civil war because i was in fifth grade or sixth grade in alabama so we learned a lot about the civil war and i remember them asking the question the war of northern aggression uh yes something like that the war between the states and i remember him asking a question to these kids who did not was our first you know lesson into the civil war and he was like what is the civil war battle that marked the turning point for the union and all the kids raised their hand said gettysburg gettysburg editor you re all wrong and i raised my hand and said oh no it s vicksburg and he s like how did you know that and i was like this is the third time i ve had to learn about civil war and i had to learn about it like 4 out of 12 grades in alabama and yet we re trying to make it where oh we can t make people feel uncomfortable because we don t want to talk about slavery we don t want to talk about the 1619 project but it s like you re not supposed to feel comfortable when you learn about history you re supposed to learn it and learn from it and i feel like this bill is aimed at it could be aimed at really removing any teachings about slavery any teachings about jim crow laws any teachings about reconstruction because any of that can make you feel uncomfortable and it can also be used in the other direction i mean an african american or someone who s hispanic could say well this conversation makes me feel uncomfortable so they could use this legislation to say well then you know i m going to sue this school because they taught a certain lesson that made me feel uncomfortable so this is going on a really simply soap in my opinion i want to agree with one thing that that ricky said you know based on her experience just being in the school system and i left being a superintendent in 2016 and uh and i totally agree with what you re saying and i think this goes too far uh there is a problem out there to be solved i think it s being there s so many things lumped together with critical race theory right it s you know there s legitimate lessons of history which you re talking about there are diversity equity inclusion trainings there are things like inherent bias training intersectionality like and these concepts keep changing and it s often hard to pin people down and what they mean as a an educator i saw some of the earlier versions of this before we called it crt in these public debates and i think there s a lot of bad uh pedagogy going on out there like i remember like i would fight with tfa for example which went from an reform oriented organization to an organization that was training like what they saw as activists and what they and what they were interpreting as activism within the classroom was teaching uh their teachers and you know like uh creating a sort of perception that skills like math reading emphasis um high behavioral expectations extended school days even standardized testing are all racist tools of oppression and they re and they re basically taking a lot of privileged white kids and you know largely liberal kids putting them into largely uh classrooms uh you know where there s mostly people of color in the south teaching them to feel guilty about it and manifest that guilt by questioning whether we should be teaching people skills or not or having high expectations of everybody in the classroom and to me that s pernicious should it be outlawed no like we should debate it we should discuss it we should confront it uh i think outlying it does nearly nothing because then you re gonna have your blue states doubled down on it the red states won t have it um private schools like you know who knows in this bill i guess they wouldn t be able to do it either and i think we should just put the stuff surface it i think people on the left should acknowledge this stuff exists i ve spent a lifetime on the left i mean i ve been in so many rooms where versions of these theories have dominated and you cannot question them lest you be accused of racism so they are real but are they as real to the extent that people are describing i looked really hard to find too many examples in florida i couldn t i mean there were a couple of examples that came to the surface but this doesn t seem to be an epidemic in florida yeah i mean i think that the most important thing to remember in k to 12 is that like the courts have helped that students have freedom of conscience and as soon as a teacher is taking sort of an activist indoctrination stance rather than just presenting facts that could potentially be violating their rights because at a public school they are a captive audience the it s a compulsory attendance sort of situation um but at the same time you know i think you know academic freedom doesn t apply to k 12 in the same way that it does with higher education but especially this conversation about rooting out specific conversations in higher ed that s super concerning to me and and dancing around history or re orienting it now because there s a potential that you d be held liable for making people uncomfortable is really um concerning and i think that a potential solution is for a bill like this to say you know you can t do affinity groups in public schools like that would be a specific targeted issue that is divisive and that could be clearly proven if someone did it or i mean i guess that could be debated but you know you need to have more specific depth to bills like this so you don t end up chilling speech because that s the worst thing you can possibly do you re a fellow at fire right the foundation for individual rights and education and correct me if i m wrong fire came out against a different bill in florida that uh i think it required professors to or like it it protected the right of students to to uh record their professors what was that all about i m not sure yeah to be honest but i do actually i pulled a i do know that they came against a florida bill but i did pull a quote from greg luciano who s the president of fire responding to bills that are worded exactly like this one and he said frivolous lawsuits are always an issue when speech restrictions focus on concepts characterized by subjective reaction like discomfort or guilt without making absolutely clear that the regulation is targeting behavior intended to create that response in students so he s the organization under the president has explicitly come down against uh bills that are just subjectively um coming against speech that makes people feel uncomfortable so but i m not i m sorry i can t speak to that specific yep uh bill well now on to our next story joe biden marks one year in office today but nobody seems to be celebrating his approval ratings are in the tank just under 42 percent despite overseeing a rebound in the job market passing a cove 19 relief bill and a landmark infrastructure package and getting nearly two thirds of americans fully vaccinated the country is struggling with decades high inflation and a never ending pandemic so let s just open up this to a conversation why do people hate joe biden so much well i think they hate him well i think that biden is not in as bad shape as we think and i m going to play my role here as a former democratic staffer and i m an emphasis on former because we re a c3 but 538 puts biden s approval rating today uh at 41 9 percent trump interestingly was at 39 5 at the same time but pretty much historically biden is in pretty bad shape you know obama was 49 8 at this period w was 81 2 you know this is post 911 clinton was 56 5 reagan was 48 9 so uh biden is definitely in bad shape but i do want to point out that the last president was even worse and came rather close to winning re election and so this is by no means dispositive for biden but i think if for thinking about democrats they ve got very little time between now and the midterms to change perceptions uh and we ll talk about what s driving those perceptions in a second but uh and second though but by the time he biden gets to re election there is historical precedence for major swings between the end of your first year in office uh and the uh the re elect like i looked at a couple of examples you know so george w went from above 80 to about 50 on election day so this was a negative swing his father had a very similar swing post iraq war uh reagan on the other hand is an example of how you go up so reagan was about 50 and then was above 60 by election day and obviously he won his re election and so there is precedent for major swings one way or the other and so uh if i were in the sort of metaphorical locker room with democrats i would say you know put your chin up and get focused on um you know just continue the work uh but if i were in the republican locker room i d probably be feeling pretty good at halftime here what are some of the major criticisms as far as just job performance i mean as far as what biden promised he promised to obviously get covet 19 under control which hasn t done that but he also promised a return to normalcy uh kind of mirrors like 1920 that same election there was a guy who promised to return to normalcy not a word by the way um but i mean has he done that is is this normal i mean i think it s a little strange to a lot of voters that he campaigned as sort of a moderate back to the old school way kind of candidate but then he has rolled out the most progressive agenda in presidential history so that s an inconsistency and i think that there were a lot of people that voted for him hoping that it would feel like a cohesive united nation again going back to a guy who s been around the block since like he was a baby basically in politics and i i mean i don t think that s what we ve gotten i think we ve gotten some some very progressive uh bills passed and some also i mean we also at the same time haven t gotten bill back better or the voting rights bill which was promised to people on the left but then we have the immigration crisis there is the issue in afghanistan every single day people are paying way more for their groceries and we re printing money kind of endlessly and looking to print more which could exacerbate inflation even further there s supply chain issues there s the issue of covid and how you know we were promised tests from essentially day one that biden got in office and now we only just got around to that and it takes seven to twelve days to actually get the test to you which feels a little counterproductive so i think that there s a lot of promises made and not kept i mean for me personally as a libertarian the biggest one was saying there won t be a vaccine mandate and then there was a vaccine mandate and then our supreme court had to go through the whole process of shooting that down like that sort of thing is pretty disappointing one thing i hear in in what you re saying ricky s a little bit of a catch 22 which is like he he wants to do all these progressive things but one of the reason why we re scoring him is not successful is because he didn t pass all those oh yeah i think it s different factions like from the left he s his approval rating is low across the board right from my vantage point as a libertarian like i don t i want like almost no government spending i don t want the the federal government to grow in size and that s i mean that s just those are my personal qualms but from the people on the left that s a pretty big uh loss and for the people on the right there are a whole other swath of issues and then for the people in the middle who just kind of wanted like a steady middle of the road guy in some ways that s not what we re getting let me defend biden a little bit here so uh you know carville famously said it s the economy stupid and i actually think that uh as we sit right now especially if if you think about like if the key drivers of inflation in the supply chain like this is the big if if those mitigate over the course of the next year and biden maintains uh the economic recovery uh you know and thinking about unemployment for example is that 3 9 percent right now from 6 7 percent a year before that uh real wages even after taking into account inflation are actually up for the lowest third of americans uh it s the the upper two thirds that are actually struggling more uh in terms of wage plus inflation which is counterintuitive to even some of the reporting that we ve done recently um so let s say that the economic recovery continues but the supply chain and inflation issues mitigate that to me is this the key to biden getting out of this mess because the economy is drives uh you know voter perception so much but then he s gotten the infrastructure bill passed he s gotten more judges confirmed than any president since reagan in his first year um he promised 100 million vaccine doses in the first hundred days and he exceeded that so if you look at his record you com you put that all on one side and that s super positive and obviously there are a lot of shortcomings there s afghanistan um there s been the herky jerky cdc uh you know almost erratic communication and policy changes there s the obviously major rises inflation and then the simple fact that biden can t complete a sentence in any way that s lucid and compelling to the american voters and so i think this is an even fight right now between biden and himself yeah since about 2017 we ve had to struggle with a president being able to complete sentences but i just want to i just want to pull this back all of the stuff you just said is great but inflation being as high as it is it s higher now than it has been since like the 70s or at least the early 80s and all the gains we ve made whether it s the stimulus checks that were passed whether it was higher wages whether it s lower unemployment none of that matters if our dollar isn t stretching more like if we re having to pay more then all of that is pretty much it s pretty much a zero sum like it s just it doesn t it doesn t matter but also when it comes to the presidency a lot of it is about image and right now joe biden s image is corrupted one by a lot of things that ricky was saying that he promised to be this middle of the road guy and yet we hear a lot of divisive language from him i mean the voting rights thing i agree with the voting rights bill but to say that if you don t agree with it you re jefferson davis i mean that s a very extreme statement and that s not going to bring anybody together that s not going to convince anybody on the other side or in the middle to then support voting rights because you re just going to push them further away so him doing things like that is very problematic but also just like i said there s just an image problem with joe biden and he can t combat this because the left wants him the left you know the democrat party is controlled by sort of moderate left but the left left like the loony left they control social media and that controls the perception of things and they don t like joe biden they don t like uh kamala harris they think that they re just you know these corporate democrats and they don t think that they re true progressives and the right literally wants him to fail because that ll make them you know look better when it comes to elections so there s really no there s like he s damned if he do damned if he doesn t in this particular case especially when you look back at biden s record i think that s an issue with the left particularly because he he was one of the architects of the crime bills in the 90s he was one of the architects of the student loan debt that now he s campaigning to forgive and so there s a long track record kind of discrepancy with him but um one thing that i really feel like ends up getting missed in these conversations about kind of like dunking on presidents or uh promoting your own side is that ultimately as americans in the end like even if it s not your party even if even if you re dissatisfied with biden this far like we should all be rooting for his approval rating to improve for this country to get better and not like worrying about anything other than just america succeeding in our president who s at the helm that the people elected succeeding ultimately yeah i think on the biden stuff about his record like he part of it is he s been in the senate i think since before i was born certainly before you two were born yeah he had to wait until his birthday to get sworn in because he was that young when he got elected third he s so old yeah now he s a little bit but part of that and this is it and i feel like i m the press secretary for biden here and so i m it s almost embarrassing but the he i would want him to evolve you know that s part of it is like i i would want him to grow and change his positions over that period of time and in many ways to me that would be his litmus test to stay in office now that being said everything positive i ve said about biden i think it would be really smart for biden for the country uh to not run again i think it would be a shame if we had a replay of the you know that you know 70 80 year old versus the 78 year old again i think if if biden didn t run and trump didn t run and we made room for new blood within these elections i i think most americans would be happy with that experience and you know maybe some new ideas some new energy you know shave a couple decades off of the you know the the average age of the people running this country like i think that would be welcome because i think as much as i m i m straining to talk about the positives of his first hundred or his first year um nobody who s honest can look at him and say this is the best that we ve got in this country right now and i m sure like if you pressed him he d probably admit that too well as long as we just don t say let s go brandon i think we had a really constructive conversation about this particular issue now on to a video that is causing backlash across twitter the nba s golden state warriors are distancing themselves from part owner chamaf paliapattia this week after the billionaire said this nobody cares nobody cares about what s happening to the weakers okay you you bring it up because you really care and i think what do you mean the rest of us don t care i m just telling you very hard you re saying you personally don t care i m telling you a very hard ugly truth okay of all the things that i care about yes it is below my line okay of all the things that i care about it is below my line if you re not familiar the uyghurs are a muslim ethnic minority group that has faced serious repression from the chinese government for years now well over a million uyghurs have been imprisoned in re education camps they re subject to rape sterilization and forced labor much of the world including the u s has condemned china s campaign as outright genocide but the nba notably has not the organization rakes in 5 billion a year from their partnerships in china and because of that the nba like most american businesses does everything in its power to steer clear of having a stance on the uyghur crisis now the warriors say polyapothea s views certainly don t reflect those of their organization but make no statement of their own on the situation in xinjiang the province in china where this is taking place so was the billionaire s comments reprehensible or a tough to swallow truth on how americans view this situation what do we what do we think about this well i think obviously we should all care about what s happening and uh whether we call it a genocide or just a like a incredibly nasty and evil crackdown on a group of people because of their ethnicity and their religion whatever you define it as in the u s has called it a genocide uh it s horrible and we should care and so he s wrong to not care but he is not alone um he goes at the end of this he said uh he goes i stand for me at the end of this uh interview and the one thing i want to give him credit for is that he s one of the only honest people i ve heard about this because i think so many people were clutching their pearls on the internet saying i can t believe you said this i can t believe you said this and what i would want to know from those people is do you buy goods from nike apple coca cola adidas calvin klein campbell soup costco you know you can go down the list and say like there s so many corporations in this country that we all depend upon that have problematic ties to that region and haven t cleansed themselves of their connection to that regime the perpetrators of this violence and we re all complicit in it and i i what i want to know from the people who get upset at him is like what are you going to do like what are you going to do to help solve this problem and if you do nothing it s functionally the same as not caring i think there s there s a difference in saying i don t care and saying i can t fix this though and i think that there would have been there are a lot of different ways that he could have taken this and said you know listen you re asking me about this because i m a minority owner of one mba team i can t fix the world s problems i m donating to xyz cause i m i have charitable uh things that i do in my life and i i can t fix the weaker problem that would have been totally fine with me but he s also wrong in saying that nobody cares 70 of americans say that they d rather take some financial losses and pay more for goods in order to stand up to the human rights abuses in china so people do care and you know the people who can actually make a difference are people in c suites that are in these corporations that could swallow a little bit of a shaving off of their margin and it s not you and i and so to hear somebody with financial power say something like that is pretty disturbing although i would say one small wrinkle is that with the nba they re china s consuming their product versus with a company like nike like we re really talking about like a profit margin which is really disturbing in the end yeah and with nike you know there was this uyghur uh forced labor protection act which passed congress and i want to be careful with my words here it s nike apple coca cola lobbied the bill i don t want to say lobbied against the bill because who the heck knows what happens behind the scenes here but it seems a little bit shady and basically what was happening was you know bipartisan bill passed essentially to force companies to break ties with this region uh it seems like what happens in china is like the supply chain is really murky and so these companies didn t want too stringent of rules applied to them but what s clear to me is that these companies fight this stuff all the way to the bitter end and there s some really depressing examples like intel for example issued a letter to its supplier saying that it was going to stop sourcing in the region but then people in china started protesting them and they rescinded they issued an apology for their previous statement and there s another company the parent company is our there was a very similar incident there where basically they find a backbone for a second and then they quickly recede into the background and the nba is particularly bad here because he s a minority owner of the golden state warriors they issued a kind of general statement saying that that uh he doesn t speak for them but what they didn t say is what their actual position is on this and that s not an accident yeah because they ve got billions of dollars at stake here and this reminds me of the lebron situation with you know daryl mori the gm of the rockets who called out uh china over the human rights in in hong kong said he stood with the protesters and all these people in the nba from steve kerr to pop this lebron james who have so much to say about so many things both domestically and around the world couldn t find their words on uh hong kong and china uh why because it s in their financial interests to be quiet in this and that s depressing yeah i think that s even worse than what shemoth did like i d rather someone just be like honestly i don t care than to care and then say oh wait i uncare now that it matters financially to me like i actually think that s worse lebron criticized mori yeah he was the one who was ignorant on hong kong gross that pisses me off look polly apatia is wrong to say nobody cares i mean ricky just gave us a stat that clearly people in this country do care about this and he was also wrong if he doesn t care he s just morally wrong however i think there is a ton of hypocrisy going on here i saw people like tucker carlson and senator tom cotton out of arkansas really doubling down throwing this guy under the bus and the reality is what china is doing to the uyghurs is disgusting it is abhorrent but it mirrors what the united states did to the indigenous population in this continent period and we got people in florida that are trying to wipe that from the history books so if we re going to stand up for human rights then let s be consistent about it i d like to hear what tucker carlson has to say about what s going on in burma or what s going on in on in congo or in south sudan or in ethiopia or in all these other countries where there are genocides taking place there are human rights abuses taking place and there are human rights abuses taking place right here in the united states of america i mean we had a interview about what s going on in alabama s prison system it s about to get taken over by the federal government because people are literally dying in there because of the type of human rights abuses that are happening their eighth amendment abuses as well and so if you re going to be you know stand up and speak out against a guy like this because he said something ignorant regarding china s human rights abuses i m all for it but then be consistent i don t like the selective outrage because they re really just doing that for political reasons in my opinion right yeah and following up to what ricky said too how much do we credit people for acknowledging something versus doing something about it right so like i m trying to think of like what how do we treat the 70 plus of people who say they would make a trade off you can make a trade off like there are websites you can go to where you can find out where materials are there are human rights groups that make recommendations on on products you could purchase you could just wear all h m all the time do people do that they don t i don t do that so i m an effing hypocrite and uh on this issue and that s what i m trying to say is like when i look at him my instinct is to be like __ this guy and then i m like well what functionally is different about the way i live my life than the way this guy lives life other than he has billions of dollars and i don t i still have a lot more money than most people on this planet and i don t make the right choice but i want to like and the question is like is the energy well spent going after this guy and dunking on him or is it well spent looking inward and saying how do i actually figure out where my money is going and is it going to the right place absolutely the man in the mirror that s where that s where it has to start yeah i m asking him to make a change yes yes take a look at yourself and make a change now on to our next story tisch james and trump so ravi what is going on here with her investigation uh into the trump organization well listeners uh and youtube watchers if you hated what i had to say about biden you might love this particular segment uh so here s what s going on here so the new york attorney general s tish james she has responsibility over the civil case against the trump organization and the manhattan district attorney alvin bragg who s appeared on the show has responsibility over the criminal case and as full disclosure i helped elect alvin bragg and when he was on the show i pushed him um on what i saw as a conflict of interest in that case or at least some bias that was present in the election and my issue here is tish james just announced that there s been significant progress in this case uh i m not going to go into too much detail about what this case is about it basically has to do with trump inflating his assets in order to get favorable loans and she seems to be signaling that she thinks she has him on a civil case on this and is going to be calling him uh to testify uh all of this to me is secondary to the fact that tish james herself has a major problem in overseeing this case because when she ran for office for this attorney general position in 2018 and multiple occasions she signaled that she was going to go after trump she used general language about how like trump needed to worry about her and that she was going to shine a light on like you know all of his books essentially and find his wrongdoing and they weren t specific claims she wasn t like there s this one like piece of evidence that people are ignoring this one crime that he did she was basically i m going to examine his history of criminal practice and get to the bottom of it this is a problem because generally speaking when you run for a position a legal position a political legal position you should not make general claims about individuals and that you want to go after them right that s like if i were uh running for you know prosecutor in staten island and i said you know what you know vito facilla who s like a republican standout i think he s a criminal and i m gonna make sure that we hold him accountable and then i get into office and i basically have a traffic cop follow him everywhere you go so i can get him you know catch him doing something wrong so there s precedence for this and when the shoe is on the other foot democrats during the trump administration matthew whitaker became the acting attorney general and he had previously made prejudicial statements about the mueller investigation and one democrat after another whether it s nancy pelosi chuck schumer jerry nadler attorneys general around the country wrote letters saying this guy needs to recuse himself and they were applying a principle to whitaker that they refused to apply in this situation and so do i think trump has broken some law it would not surprise me but it in the end when you re talking about prosecuting anybody especially the former president united states everything needs to be clean this is not a clean investigation she needs to recuse herself and i think the fact that she has gone this far without recusing herself means to me that this entire investigation is suspect uh and it really worries me very sus very such indeed it just reminds me of the democrats have done this before with trump they did this with the mueller investigation this thing of oh we re gonna find this smoking gun we re gonna find this thing against trump and then when that fizzled out it was like oh never mind and then you know the whole ukraine thing happened and that was a much more serious accusation a much more serious possible crime that trump committed but then it didn t have as much of an effect because people were like well you ve done this before you ve said this before with the mueller investigation and then the same thing with the gen 6 stuff it doesn t have as much effect when you constantly go into office i mean there were people there was a senator um i think he was a congressman out of texas uh his name was al greene not singer and he was like i m we re gonna impeach trump like he came in like in 2017 saying we re going to impeach trump for no reason and so it s like when you keep saying that over and over and over again then when there s actual you know it s like crying wolf when there s actually something there people don t believe it because you ve just spent your whole time saying you re gonna do this against this person just because they re politically different from you yeah and a lot of my friends on the left will say well he he needs to you know he needs to abide by the law like anybody else but the the very fact of some some of these accusations uh to me like she said during i think this was during her acceptance she said i will shine a light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings every dealing so yeah like everybody needs to abide by the law but like are you are you actually like like are you examining every aspect of this person s life to find the wrong doing or is the wrong doing brought to you and you re just following up on it these are the questions i would want to ask yeah definitely i mean from my vantage point it does sound a bit like a witch hunt and i would say that on either side whether or not i like trump or whatever candidate it is that that should never be a motivated sort of way of going after someone but i m curious is there like any way that you think we can prevent people from campaigning on promises like this going forward yeah well one thing i told a left leaning audience uh about you know earlier this year or last year was imagine a situation where somebody runs for attorney general of arkansas a republican on the promise to go after the clintons and in that situation let s say they won and then they then open a civil and then criminal investigation of hillary clinton bill clinton the clinton foundation etc how would you feel so i think this is important as people to have the shoe on the other foot now you re supposed to have like you know bar associations etc that hold people accountable to this kind of stuff but they re so politicized and i think it s safe to say that the new york bar is not filled with a lot of trump fans and so i m not sure what they ve had to say about this but i would be surprised if they had too much to say about this and you know when we had alvin bragg on the show that man d a i pushed him on this too it s just you know i supported him in that campaign and i think that you know i continue to think and his office is not too far from here that he needs to recuse himself from that too because that s even more serious that s the criminal investigation and so uh and honestly i love alvin but his answer was not very satisfactory i ve been thinking about it a lot since you know he said i promised i would go after him so basically he s saying i promise i d go after her but i need to keep my campaign promise and i m just like this is the opposite of how this is supposed to work and it s not legitimate and i would say that as much as inflating your real estate assets in order to get a favorable loan uh sounds like the kind of thing that s wrong i m not sure it rises to the level of the kind of thing that we should be locking up a form of prizes in the united states in such a highly politicized environment for like i just even even if you put aside how this even came about in front of us it just doesn t feel right to me so let s move on to a story that ricky is going to tell us about what is going on in england so yesterday bars johnson announced that for england and not the entirety of the uk they are going to roll back pretty much all major uh covid lockdown measures that they have in place mass mandates are going away vaccine passports are going away and there s no more recommendation to work from home and so he also said to parliament yesterday that this is essentially a concession that we re going to have to learn to live with covet like it s the flu because omicron is sort of past its peak in england now and so i m really excited about this because i i was worried that now that we have a kind of shifting um danger that s facing us with kovid that leaders might not respond to the most pragmatic way and might still be holding on to some of the restrictions and the power with that but this is kind of evidence that we re actually responding to an evolving threat and so i m curious to hear what you guys have to say well it was funny just trying to follow this story because i m reading uh bbc trying to get to the bottom you know what s going on and they have they ve reports of you know northern ireland may follow and whales may follow i m like wait a minute what like it reminded me of ted lasso there s a part where he goes how many countries are in this country i m like what s going on here so um i m still confused as to what the united kingdom in england is and it s been explained to me a hundred times but um i ll put that aside because he s the uk prime minister so i don t know but i ll put that aside and admit to one embarrassing fact which is my in reaction to this just trying to marshal evidence for my pre existing biases i was looking up hospital bed capacity in the uk versus the united states just getting ready to be like well the difference is they have a better hospital bed capacity but which is not true turns out us and uk have about the same hospital capacity and about the same amount of physicians and nurses and things like that so uh less guns over there though so i don t have as much to marshal from this other than to say i i stand by to see how this goes yeah so there s england there s wales and there s scotland now but um northern ireland yeah and there s northern ireland and yeah it s all one thing but it s all different too at the same time but um i think this could be a model for for united states as well as just other countries to figure out a way to still take covet 19 serious but also get back to normal because we just can t i mean this is like the third year of this now like we just can t keep you know but but like we ve talked about it before there is this like pandemic class that enjoys these restrictions like people who are people somebody calls the pajama class yeah they love the work from home they love to stay away from crowds they love to wear the mask they ve just created into a whole political identity so i felt like it would be more difficult here in the united states for us to do stuff like england and i feel like there would be like a left wing political pushback to it well ricky i had a question for you on this because part of that what was surprising to me is you know it s a different type of system it s parliamentary system so it s not federalists like us so when the government says it essentially happens across the country and what he was rolling back is such an interesting combination of policies because a lot of them will seem familiar to us but one of them stood out to me which was this work from home guidance which essentially it seems to me like england had been under a an advisory to work from home and i guess people followed that there like essentially people even more than in the united states weren t going into the office like here at las vegas everybody s here we re all in person i don t even know what the guidance is from the cdc is anymore on whether you should go to the office but i know a lot of people are aren t following that yeah i mean one of the things that johnson said was one of the reasons that they were rolling it back was because people complied so much which i mean i think some of those restrictions were probably a bit unreasonable but um yeah i mean it s a different situation here because we re a little bit behind in terms of omicron england and especially london peaked before us and we also have a much bigger country so different waves are happening in different places and i think you know there s still little pockets where delta is still kind of at play but um yeah i mean we definitely have a different system and if we want to roll back mandates that does have to happen on a more local level but this is a great model and this follows spain and even australia now is kind of saying we re going to live with this in an endemic way and i think that we d all probably benefit in doing that and then saying okay here s our very specific at risk demographics and population that we need to continue to make sure that there s a space for them in society to live healthy and safe lives and everyone else can kind of continue which i m i m all here for when am i going to be able to go to a bar in new york without having to show my vax car that s what i want i think it s hard to say and that s why i think people need to learn from this kind of stuff like you know joking aside about the kind of evidence i wanted marshall i do think that there is a problem in this country of learning from available evidence right like sweden for example like there was this this massive rejection of sweden as an idea early on in this pandemic when they were more permissive and were less restrictive than other countries and because people on the left saw people on the right using sweden as evidence of uh of a different better kind of covert policy people immediately rejected it because they rejected the people sharing the anecdote but i think if you look back on it uh at least from what i ve seen sweden is a really interesting case study because the economist was ranking how different countries have fared during the pandemic and sweden did pretty well and so if that s true and if the uk or england in coming out of these restrictions fares better than other more restrictive places we need to learn from that and um there s so it s a controlled experiment right now you can compare it to places like hong kong for example which is going in the opposite direction where they canceled classes for secondary school and but i worry about our ability to do this like i was doing an interview yesterday in different contexts where this pollster this democratic pollster was making one claim after another that to me didn t seem accurate like we were talking about um like we still need to keep people home and school closures worked and all this and then i went to go look up the data after the interview it s hard to fact check people in real time i looked at the data and there s very little evidence that uh sustained school closures actually helped prevent human community spread over time yeah absolutely yeah well hopefully we can get back to some sense of uh normalcy here in new york city but i think that is going to be the end of our

if you add 7 million jobs but no one hears you say it does that help your poll numbers for president biden the answer seems to be no and there may be a couple of reasons for that with such strong job numbers coming out of march what is going on here why can t the byte administration seem to convince people that he s doing a good job on the economy right and so just to put some numbers behind this the us added 431 000 jobs in march and the unemployment rate is down to 3 6 which is compared to 3 5 percent in february 2020 so on on many employment numbers including labor force participation we re getting closer and closer to the pre pandemic levels uh and cnn and moody s have like a back to normal index which puts the economy at 95 percent where it was pre covered so you would on a lot of these metrics right the economy is getting back to where it was but obviously one of the most glaring stats out there is inflation right and i think you ve got this this tension between uh the fact that we re adding jobs and the fact that inflation is going up and they re actually related obviously because uh the lower the unemployment the more workers can demand in wages uh and the more they demand in wages the more prices will go up as well not that that s necessarily the most significant driver of inflation but it can be a driver and what s interesting is that when you ask voters about this voters um by a small margin are more likely to say that we ve lost jobs over the past year than that we ve gained jobs so voters are not seeing uh in their everyday lives this improved economy they actually they re not even perceiving job gains when we re having pretty significant job games over the past year yeah it s roughly only um a quarter of voters who think that we are adding jobs which is correct but at the same time there s the issue of the labor force participation rate where this has already been on a downward trend where less and less people were actually actively seeking work and then during the pandemic it plummeted and it still hasn t really come back to where it s been and i think that that s just translated into a ton of staffing shortages which i wonder if that s what people are conflating because we know that there is inherently an issue with job matching up in uh in our market and so that hasn t translated into unemployment per se but there are huge gaps in our labor force and i think we ve all kind of felt it like whether you re sitting at a restaurant and there s like one waiter there um and there it s led to mcdonald s having a 500 sign on bonus at some locations truckers in portland got a 30 grand sign on bonus um and you know there s a ton of different factors behind that whether it s people who are being dubbed epiphany quitters who during the pandemic decided i m not doing something i want to do there tends to be recently a much bigger amount of people who are kind of just mismatched with jobs that are in the market but as a whole i think we re seeing a shift in our economy about what jobs people are willing to do or want to do and i think there s probably somehow that s connected to people perceiving that as an unemployment issue when really it s just our economy is not reflective of the workers right now there are two different phenomena going on at once one was is the during pandemic version of this which was mainly driven by retirements people staying at home to care for a family member whether it s a child parent grandparent etc but this trend was actually pretty stark before the pandemic and as i looked into this i was pretty surprised to see what was driving this so it was actually the largest group uh driving uh the decrease in labor force participation were actually men aged 25 to 54 so these are people in their peak earning years which i found really surprising and when you ask people uh why they re leaving the workforce the number one reason given was disability or illness i have reason to think that that might also be and some of the data bears this out uh related to some trends in our country like the opioid epidemic but we have to go into that uh there s also more stay at home deads um you have de industrialization uh you have incarceration as a barrier to entry which is obviously been a trend for a long time in our country but i found that surprising that it s men in their prime working years that were driving this number before the pandemic you know some of those men may become stay at home fathers like you said i mean that happened to me for a year after the pandemic i just became a stay at home father and maybe i would have been a part of that uh particular uh rate of uh decrease in labor force participation but also i think the the bigger thing that i want to get to here is the obama administration is just terrible at communicating messages and i think that s something we ve seen this entire time if we if we really rank how good or bad they ve done at certain things it hasn t been the worst administration in the world but it s just the communication they just can t seem to explain to us how good they are doing if i was biting i d be out there every single day saying look at these low unemployments remember when trump said lowest unemployment rate ever like technically there are 10 states right now that literally have lowest unemployment rate ever and we really just haven t heard by talking about it but i guess the big question there is he could yell that all day long it s not going to change a 7 9 inflation rate and so if he improved his communication would that in any way improve the outlook that people have on this situation i think part of it is the nature of the amount of things this administration has dealt with whether it s covid afghanistan ukraine you can go on and on and on i m not making excuse for it i m just saying that they have very little room to stay on message for any significant period of time my guess is as you head into the presidential election year you re going to hear them almost exclusively talking about this and the question is are they going to win the day on that messaging or are republicans going to win the day i i ll read this quote though the republicans seem pretty confident in this this is from michael mcadams who s the the nrcc s communication director so the head of the republican congressional campaign committee s communications and this is what he had to say to politico he said nothing i ve seen in my decade of working in politics has been as sailing as the inflation inflation message with voters when republicans are talking about people encountering rising prices every minute of every day versus democrats talking about bridges that might be built in three years it s like an nfl team going against a pwe football team i think he might be right yeah i think there s no getting around whether he improves his messaging on unemployment there s no getting around the fact that every time anyone pays for literally anything whether it s just a carton of eggs people are feeling the fact that the economy is broken and i think obviously there s a misunderstanding and a blame being placed on the unemployment rates but regardless that still is a reflection on the administration in most people s minds there are some partisan numbers where 16 of republicans are able to accurately identify that we actually have increased the number of jobs versus 36 percent of democrats but in the end i think everyone is just feeling the reality of our economy right now on a very personal level and i don t know if messaging can really get around that yeah and to add to that partisan nature of this there was a pew survey that asked voters at the beginning and the end of the trump administration how they would rate the economy or the beginning or near the end of the trump administration and 18 of republicans rated economic conditions as good or excellent during uh during 2016 81 percent did in january 2020 whereas democrats didn t change their views at all pretty much during that same period of time and so it shows you just how stubborn people are in the face of data right like same economy but you know your political party basically determines how you view that economy music applause music you,"economic,economy,covid,wages,jobs,million

debate a show for political eclectics i m robbie gupta i m corey bradford and i m ricky schlot well corey where are we going to start today we got a big show today we re going to be talking about a lot of interesting things coming up supreme court justice stephen breyer is stepping down leaving biden to choose his replacement so far there s a short list and a campaign promise from biden to nominate a black woman we discussed the implications of all of that after a record setting year the stock market is flirting with a correction ravi takes us through what to watch and this is not financial advice should we all panic sale libel laws are under the microscope because of an unlikely duo between sarah palin and cardi b we ll take you through the significance of those cases and the old adage everything that s old is new again we explore the emerging trend that old music is more popular on streaming platforms than newer music but first things first joe rogan had psychologist and author jordan peterson on his podcast for a four hour very long conversation this week they touched on topics ranging from race to climate change and while you may not have thought of jordan peterson as an expert in those areas because well he s not he sure had a lot to say about them on climate in particular peterson has provoked backlash for questioning the validity of climate change let s check out this clip climate change one is a weird one so that one that s because there s no such thing as climate right climate and everything are the same word and i that s what bothers me about the climate change types it s like this is something that bothers me about it technically it s like climate is about everything it s okay but your models aren t based on everything your models are based on a set number of variables yeah so that means you ve reduced the variables which are everything to that set well how did you decide which set of variables to include in the equation if it s about everything and that s not just a criticism that s like if it s about everything your models aren t right because your models do not and cannot model everything i m confused uh what i know i know both you ravi and ricky you both watched this entire interview i got through a little bit of it um what is the takeaway here what does he mean by climbing is everything yeah i think this reminds me a lot of people when i was running schools there were these people who were proponents of this idea of the whole child approach to education and they would say you know we can t be measuring and testing reading or writing or math because it s the whole child and you can t isolate any one variable and what i would say to them is what i would say to peterson which is like if you go to the doctor and your doctor says that you have high ldl uh or you know your bmi is increasing dramatically that doesn t tell you everything about your life and and your health but it certainly should be alarming right and that s how i think about climate change the fact that we re dramatically increasing co2 into the atmosphere and the earth is warming and that if it continues to warm at the rate that it that it is we re in for some very reliably catastrophic scenarios uh is important and i think this is just like sophistry to say all right well because you can t include every possible variable doesn t mean that the variables that you are paying attention to uh aren t really important absolutely what do w what do we think about here when he says the models for climate change aren t accurate because they don t include enough variables well he s wrong about that so zeke house father which is quite a name from the university of cal berkeley looked at 17 of the most sophisticated and most used models for climate that were developed between 1970 and 2007 and found that 10 depending on your account 10 to 14 of those models were accurate meaning and predicting the future meaning most of them were accurate and predicting the future but the whole point is we know the characteristics of co2 we know the kind of impact it has on a warming climate we know that we re increasing it and so even if there are other things that could happen like you know are there things that could happen to mitigate climate change that we can t predict today sure just like i could step out tomorrow and get hit by a car that doesn t mean i shouldn t take my ldl serious uh today so uh this is what i m saying is like he s he s basically saying we can t take seriously anything unless we can evaluate all things all the time and then i would wonder like then are we just like relativists like we just walk around and care about nothing at this point yeah this as a peterson fan this interview kind of made me cringe a little bit because now like i was ready to come in and defend him but like i think that s something that we do here well is like full disclosure next segments about the stock market and i don t really know what s going on and like i m gonna admit that and i feel like there s this this feeling that everybody in the media needs to know everything about every single issue and this conversation just happened because rogan brought up that he was reading a book about climate change and then it just went off into this long rant from from peterson he couldn t help himself i think that you know there s a lot of things that i think that peterson s really compelling on like like issues of personality a personal responsibility um his biblical series he s i think he s an agnostic and i ve found as somebody who s kind of identifies as a deist like he s made me way more christian than going to church has somehow which is he s got a really interesting like i m not preaching to you kind of vantage point and there s a lot of really compelling stuff in my opinion that peterson does this is not it and i wish that people could just be like i don t really know that much about this thing right and i think that s that s a great trait because that s why we don t have faith in media figures and you know i don t want to hear about what peterson has to say about climate or the carnivore diet like i don t i m okay well i agree with you i like there are certain parts of peterson s you know what made him famous in the first place in his his book that just kind of pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind of preaching to young men in particular i think there s a lot of good there and it s amazing because i think you could immediately see in this interview that he s high in his own supply he gets in there and he s like he cannot let the pitch go by of rogan saying he was reading a book on climate change and has to make the whole beginning of the interview about that and i think you know rogan s in the news right now because there s you know a lot of scrutiny of of how whether he s promoting misinformation or disinformation on his show i would say that he acquits himself quite well in this not just because i m somebody using climate change but because i m not sure and rogan says he basically says he s not sure where he comes out yet but i think he did a really good job in this interview of asking simple questions of peterson repeatedly to justify certain claims he was making and at times they would look certain things up that peterson was describing and i think in many ways it it shows either an evolution of rogan i m not as much of a connoisseur of rogan but like either an evolution in his approach or you know maybe that he s he s better at you know fact checking than people give him credit for but there was another part of this interview that i want to highlight which is uh the peterson goes on to say that uh liberals and people who believe in climate change want to you know our main solution is to lower economic development especially for the less well off and and peterson says that the solution of climate change is actually economic development and to make the poor richer the fastest way to make the planet sustainably green and ecologically viable is to make poor people as rich as possible as fast as we possibly can and so there s sort of two main claims here one is that the main solution to climate change being pushed is to actually harm economic development and so we should examine that and then the second is this idea that the solution is to make poor people richer and i looked at both of these i think there s definitely some truth to some people who are you know who are learned about climate change who want to do things like tax carbon and make energy uh more expensive but i don t think that that s the majority of people and in part i want to read you know bill gates probably the biggest investor in the climate change world and certainly on the philanthropic side this is from his book he said um his book that uh how to avoid a climate disaster he goes i kept thinking about what i d witness in my travels india for example has a population of 1 4 billion people many of them among the poorest in the world and i didn t think it was fair for anyone to tell indians that their children couldn t have lights to study by or that thousands of indians should die in heatwaves because installing air conditioners is bad for the environment the only solution i could imagine was to make clean energy so cheap that every country would choose it over fossil fuels so i think gates is is i think reflective of most people who care about this issue it just say we don t want to make energy more expensive for indians we want to actually invest in r d uh and deployment of technology to make it cheaper uh for them so that the trade off makes sense uh so that s where i m coming from on this is like i think he presents a false choice in this interview so i think what i m gathering from this is that jordan peters is not really an expert on the climate yeah ricky as somebody who is familiar with a lot of jordan peterson s work i m someone who s not that familiar with his work what about him has this appeal that the fact that we re even talking about this interview this was supposed to be a big deal so what is it about that appeal that even allows him to be able to have a four hour interview with joe rogan yeah um i think that he is definitely a thought leader in a way that um you know i hear all the time that young men are empowered by him i found him empowering i never heard any message of his that i felt was particularly directed towards men but i think that he brings this message especially to younger people that are like my generation s very nihilistic and that s just obvious it s in our music and our culture and how that we think about the world and having somebody who kind of teaches you to take personal personal initiative to kind of pull yourself up by the bootstraps to make a difference in your life and find meaning through just kind of in like kind of more traditional ways how it used to be while everyone else is kind of nihilistic i mean that s just i think that s kind of the common thread of it and even just his older work i think on youtube that s that s really where where a lot of his inspiring stuff is maybe not everyone will find it that way but um i think there s definitely some stuff that s worth checking out of his and um i just i think he he teaches a a way to find meaning in a way that a lot of people aren t able to today yeah i would encourage people who i get the question often from left leaning people who are like explain to me this jordan peterson phenomenon and i think reading his book i think is like his book and some of those early youtube videos because i think uh correctly from wrong he came to prominence because he was doing uh videos online challenging candidates hate speech laws there s actually a really interesting documentary about his rise and it shows basically how he was challenging these laws in in canada about i think things like gender pronouns and how you refer to people and all that and he kind of expanded it out and i think even if you re not with him on the underlying issue um the kinds of battles he was having in canada explain a lot about why i think he appeals more to the right and the left and i think it s a shame in in many ways because his book is not necessarily a right wing book like you read that book and it it really is like a self help book yeah and i think that even if i disagree with maybe half of the stuff in there the other half that that i think is valuable is really unique and and i think speaks to why the book is so popular definitely and i think as bill s c16 stuff from canada sometimes ends up giving it more of a right wing reputation just because it does deal with gender but i think it s important to remember that his argument about it was about compelled speech and not whether or not he would respect someone s pronouns just by choice and so i think that because it fell on that fault line of a really delicate social issue he automatically kind of became a figurehead of the right whereas i think that argument is really just a free speech argument in the end but then again he does have other right wing values yeah he you know as much it makes it hard for me to advocate for him with left leaning audiences where he does stuff in this interview which is repeatedly come back to this is the problem the left this is the problem on the left yeah and it s you know our whole operation here is about trying to critique the left the right to center anybody and i find him routinely doing things that we try to avoid here which is create the most uncharitable version of the other side and knock it down which is what he did here on climate change like he did no work whatsoever to say well actually there are a lot of people who uh you know are advocating for solutions to climate change that don t make the poor worse off and so i only want to critique a small part of them he could have easily said that but he didn t yeah i think part of that also comes there s a pattern of people from academia who become thought leaders in like the kind of right wing where they are in these academic circles where the most political extreme stuff can thrive because it s not really real world applications and so even coming from a university a few months ago like there s some crazy stuff and if i spend enough time there i might be kind of caricaturing the left in my mind in the way that i think that sometimes he tends to so i feel like there s an interesting kind of common thread of the people who do that often come from academia right right i think it s just one of those examples of kind of like staying in your league when it comes to expressing your thoughts about certain subjects i think if peterson had stayed into the realm of what he knows more about this probably would have been a moral i think we should add that to the rules for life then maybe that ll be what is it 12 rules for life so we ll make that the 13th yeah stay in your league guys all right so the supreme court s oldest liberal justice stephen breyer is stepping down at the age of 83 his retirement opens the way for president biden to nominate a liberal justice while democrats still control the senate now biden s nominee won t change the political makeup of the court which will still have six conservative justices and three liberals but it will change the bench s makeup in one significant way because brighton during the campaign promised he would nominate a black woman so let s just start with that uh is it ever a good idea to if whether it s you know supreme court or vice president pick is it ever a good idea for somebody to say you know i m going to nominate this person they have to be this gender they have to be this race is that ever a good way to start the conversation i think this is the challenge of this country really because there have been 115 justices who ve served on the supreme court all but seven have been white men so uh that s obviously alarming and it s not accidental at the same time i think announcing ahead of time that this is your litmus test undermines whoever you re gonna pick because then it makes it seem like that was the qualification not how smart you are how great of a jurist you are and so i know this seems like i m kind of hedging here i understand why people were demanding of biden such a promise because there s frustration out there with the fact that there hasn t been great representation but at the same time if he could have gotten away with not making that promise i think everybody would be better off including whoever he picks because it just it delegitimizes that person before they even enter the seat 100 i think um you know as a woman all the time i feel like there s these women in journalism events and awards for women specifically and like i i appreciate that in a sense but at the same time i want to be recognized for me and i think that s um i agree with you that that there s a necessity to have people that fit those demographics ultimately coming to the court and even if he did pick that behind the scenes i i wouldn t really have an issue with it but i think the optics of announcing that and promising it you always end up undermining people when when you pick them or you say you re going to pick them for an immutable characteristic then that ends up kind of holding the weight and giving fuel to the people that oppose them in my opinion yeah what i will say here is that there is a precedent for this um ronald reagan in 1980 when he was running for president he vowed that he was going to put a woman on the supreme court and he did george h w bush the supreme court justice thurgood marshall died when george w bush was president and he felt compelled to replace a black justice with another black justice so that s how we got stuck with clarence thomas um and so it was ideologically very different from marshall but but fit the graph and that s actually a good point the fact that george w bush put another black man on the court but he was so ideologically different from the one he replaced that it seems to me that ideology would be the more important characteristic that a president would look for rather than just blank and blanketly saying oh it has to be a person that fits this demographic right and i think this this relates to the problem kamala harris is having because obviously there s a lot of speculation that i think wrong speculation i think it s stupid that that biden would nominate her that she would she wouldn t serve i think if she was nominated but that wouldn t make any sense because if it s a 50 50 tie in the senate then who would break the tie yeah no you would replace her but i think like the but i do think that her challenges in many ways come back to the promised by made there which is i think people look at her and don t see somebody who is picked for her qualifications but because of her identity whether it s right or wrong we ve we ve spoken on this issue before i m not gonna i don t feel like we need to go back into it but i do think like the american public looks at her and says this is not somebody who was chosen for any other reason than her identity that she was the best person of this narrow group of people that we could have picked and i think that s the challenge that she faces i think there s gonna be a challenge that the next supreme court justice faced now in the end the supreme court justices who sit for life so i think really in the end it s not as consequential because their main audience is the other eight justices so i wouldn t say it s anywhere near the the size of the issue that um that harris faces yeah but i think the politics of this are interesting because you ve got uh two names that are consistently coming up one is uh katanji brown jackson who s on the dc circuit i think that s the most likely name to make it through here because she made it uh out of confirmation just recently to get that seat in the dc circuit and she got three republican votes she got lisa murkowski susan collins and lindsey graham so there s lizzy graham yeah and so there s some sense that she already has been tested through the senate now obviously this is a higher seat so there could be a whole different debate and i wouldn t count on anybody in the us senate to be consistent yeah not these days um and like they you could you could see them making an argument like different tests for the supreme court but i think she s gonna be the most likely i think she would make it through but correct me if i m wrong you used to have to have 60 votes to support somebody else s supreme yeah they changed mcconnell changed the filibuster but carmel changed it so it s kind of a backfire onto mcconnell here because he could have had more control the republicans could have had more control over this pick he ll come out ahead trust me on this one he always takes that away doesn t he he may even block this too so get the best of both worlds oh he ll absolutely figure out a way i m absolutely and you know we were doing some research about like the qualifications to be on the supreme court and there really are none i mean you ve got to be confirmed by the senate but you don t have to even go on the law school yeah on the supreme court and there s no age requirements either because there s an age requirement on the presidency requirement to go in the center of the house there s no age requirements on the supreme court so i say let s get a teenager on something a lot of the trump confirmations like i m not blaming this on any one party but i think each each administration gets a little bit more brazen and he was he was nominating people that are super young on to the circuits and district courts and you know these people will be with us forever for a long time yeah absolutely well we ll see who he ends up nominating um it s been a year since robin hood reddit and gamestop came together to shake up the stock market this time last year retail investors were pouring money into meme stocks like game stock and amc sending share prices well past any rational level to the moon as the reddit crowd likes to say fast forward to now and the u s markets are in a correction territory with the fed widely expected to raise interest rates stocks have surged pretty much non stop since the first months of the pandemic driving a lot of valuations to absurdly high levels but now a lot of people are looking around and asking is the party over ravi um take me through this like what should i be doing right now yeah well okay this is not investment advice to any of you or to any of our listeners but i think we should start with jeremy grantham who is uh the founder of gmo which is a firm out of boston and grantham i want to start with grantham because he has been really credible on the question of bubbles and he s a proponent of what this theory of like reversion to the mean meaning that there are certain trends in american society uh economically and the market always reverts back to the mean and he s been tested so this guy uh avoided the japan disaster in 89 he voted the dot com bubble he seriously mitigated his downside in the housing bubble so he s been right a lot now he s been talking for years uh about the fact that uh we re headed for an iceberg in our current climate uh and he did an interview a couple days ago to describe this let s look at a couple clips from that interview super bubbles can really wipe you out like 1929 did so we re talking about a decline of certainly from the peak of almost 50 percent and of course it declined very quickly 50 in 1929 it declined 50 in three years in 2000 and the housing market which was another great american super bubble went all the way back to trend uh in three years so basically what he s saying he s calling this a super bubble and he says there were only three other super bubbles in the past 100 years 1929 2000 in japan and 89 and this is the first time ever he claims that we have simultaneous bubbles across all asset classes uh or and you know i m i m going to walk you through a little bit of this so housing uh houses in the us are at the highest multiple of family income ever including leading up to the housing crisis uh and he this is not just a u s problem there s it s actually more pronounced in countries around the world so this could be a global problem canada australia uk china all have actually worse problems here wow uh equities and stocks so there s this thing called the shiller price earnings ratio essentially saying like how is your stock trading relative to how much uh revenue you re bringing in how much earnings you re bringing in over like a 10 year average and those ratios are typically somewhere between 17 and 20 and in december they touched 39 so basically double what they have been historically and if you look into the details there s so many absurd examples in the equities market like rivian is a good example this car company yeah um was trading um at a higher rate uh it had a higher market valuation than ford uh even though rivien had not sold a single car at that point and ford was selling something like 1 8 million cars uh and so there s all this crazy absurd behavior and then there s the bond market which we saw the period of the highest price bonds ever which means the lowest yields which means that it is more um like you getting anything out of your savings is harder than ever which means that everybody s forced into the market to play this game and actually putting money into savings you lose money in real terms so everybody s being forced out into this uh and which means drives up all the prices of the equities so it s kind of a circular problem and then you have commodities where you have oil and important metals all trending above the average the un uh global index for food prices is at an all time high or around an all time high so you put those four categories together and grantham is saying this is a perfect storm and this is worse than anything we ve ever seen in our lifetime we ve never seen all these forces come together and when we think about the dot com bubble is mainly an equities problem we think about the the housing bubble it was mainly a housing issue right it was japan where there were two separate things happening at once where there was the real estate market and equities at the same time but you didn t see all this other stuff like the commodities and the bonds etc and he says um and this is where i ll kick it to you guys to think about what this means he says we face the greatest potential markdown of wealth in u s history if valuations across all these asset classes return even to two thirds of the way back to historical norms total wealth losses will be on the order of 35 trillion dollars felt like i m on cnbc right now so what s driving this this over evaluation of all these stocks yeah i i think like for him there are multiple explanations and i think one thing that i would caution our listeners to do is avoid the one uh simple explanation right and that s why i like grantham is like he is bringing together a lot of different explanations to say that when you have this super bubble and you have multiple asset classes all having similar problems but there there isn t just one explanation for it right i think a lot of attention is being paid to the fed and they deserve a lot of the blame and this has been going on for a long time greenspan juiced the uh equities market leading up to the dot com bubble even though he said it was a irrational exuberance he played a huge part in that and then sowed the seeds for the housing bubble by basically going after the head of the cftc at the time who wanted to police the derivatives market which was the ticking time bomb that got us into housing bubble bernanke when he was at the fed uh famously underplayed the housing bubble basically said there wasn t a housing bubble and said that in our history of our country we ve never seen housing prices go down well surprised they did go down right after that um and you ve been seeing similar problems where the fed and some of these aren t like and this is where like i m not saying that that these are just evil people i just think they have a bad theory about how to manage the economy so you know over the past you know whether it s powell uh and um uh what you know whether it s power or even like uh you know yelling at the treasury and when she was at the fed uh they have this theory that we need to pump as much money into the economy as possible and they have not they have no sense about the unintended consequences of what that means and basically what s happened is interest rates have mainta have stayed low uh basically they re at record lows uh which everybody thinks of as a good thing because people could buy houses and all that kind of stuff but that also means that if you re the the kind of person who s conservative you just want to put money in a savings account you re losing money over time which means that everything gets more expensive because it makes no sense to keep money in savings uh and then at the same time uh through this this policy of quantitative easing they re pumping money into the private sector money is cheap for corporations which drives these valuations right like one of the reasons why a lot of these companies don t go out of business uh or they re the the price of the stock isn t reflective of their actual unit economics is because the fed is making it so easy to just pull money out uh and so what you re going to see now as rates go up as quantitative easing uh gets pulled back which the fed is signaled they re likely to be heading towards then you re going to see prices of equities go down you re going to see potentially inflation go down and all this and once you see the drop in all these assets you re going to see wealth disintegrate in this country and that is going to be frightening well i ve already kind of surrendered my credibility on this person in the beginning of the podcast but yeah i mean i have to say from during the pandemic during lockdown i was living with my mom in la she was a former financial advisor and so she trades stocks now kind of full time and i remember sitting through the pandemic and thinking like okay like everyone s losing their jobs like small businesses are crippled and what the heck is happening in the stock market like she d be like oh i had a great day today and i m like none of this makes sense and so and just intuitive intuitively to me the whole time like it just has felt completely off with what our culture and what like the real economic ground level experiences for everyday americans has just not been reflected in the stock market which to me just just felt wrong the entire time and i think in part that s probably because of the way that the interest rates have gone down and how you know rich people have more money to just kind of play with in the stock market and yeah i m i m a little concerned well he makes it he makes a scary prediction which essentially he says that the speculative stocks fall first but he says it starts with the speculative stocks and then it moves to the blue chip stocks and so that the question then becomes and this is where we truly become cnbc is where do you put your money yeah is a big question and i think here s my sense and i m talking i ll talk about what i would i how i m thinking about this um not not this is not advice uh is uh there are two different theories uh of of where you should go from here there s one theory which is all right the s p 500 every uh every 11 months goes down about 10 on average right historically so maybe you know there are the pelotons and these other companies are losing 50 plus percent of their valuations but their most other stocks are somewhere in that 10 range you know and who knows by the end of this stocks could be up or down it s such a volatile market right now uh so there s a theory that says not much different is happening and at that point uh just invest in those blue chip stocks because this is not going to reach them so look at the companies that actually have earnings have good union economics like an apple or something right like a company and you know apple has you know 190 billion dollars of cash on its books so that s a company that s probably going to weather the storm yeah that s one group of people that advocate for that i m sympathetic to that and i don t know enough to say whether that s wrong or not grantham goes further and says get out of us equities all together he has a few theories you could watch this interview uh about where you can go from here uh and he i think he s basically advising for people to keep an eye on the bond market and your savings accounts and see if the high yield savings accounts come back to the point where you can move money into something that s going to predictively give you a few percentage points either match or outpace inflation and that would be like a conservative approach to this i don t really know the answer that but i would not be investing in speculative stocks right now you could get lucky you could catch peloton or zoom on on the on the bounce but if you can t afford to lose that money then you shouldn t be playing in the market in that way i blame tick tock to be totally honest with you because of gamestop yeah handstop stuff i felt like that had a lot to do with like over evaluating uh companies and things like that and it kind of goes back to i mean this is all sounding real 1929 ish to me yeah and it goes back to i think it s a quote that s attributed to joseph kennedy jfk s father who said something to the effect of when the shoeshine boys are giving you stock tips it s time to take your money out of the market well that s my thing right now i i personally feel like you know when the tick tock boys and the redditors are giving you stock tips it s time to take your money out of the market well let me let me get to one piece on that before we move on which is uh i was looking into this and i thought to myself hey is the retail investing driving part of this but interestingly 50 56 of american adults own stock right now which is about the same that it s been for the past 20 years so even though that some of these new tools like robin hood have changed maybe the way people interact with the market uh the average american is not any more exposed it seems to the market than they were before and i think in in large part like these new tools are democratizing in many ways like it s good for me that robin hood doesn t charge fees now yeah what they do with your data and all that is a whole separate question that we should be challenging uh and i think that you know there s all this brouhaha over the gamestop stuff and i think there was like a you know the elites that were getting challenged because they were saying all right uh don t you know you re able to invest whichever way you want you could invest in sophisticated options or whatever but the minute the average person does that you get mad at them uh and then they re but then the elites were saying look i m just saying i don t want you to lose your life savings in in a stock that has no uh you know historic earnings and like a lot of these are industries that are that are on the downwards in fact like a movie theater chain you know like these are things that that there s not a strong story as to why it should be you know 100 times its value from one week to the next and i think in the end you re a libertarian i i imagine this is your case like let people make their mistakes is how people learn like if people go in there and lose money on like we can t like we can t be so paternalistic as to say i m gonna tie your hands for you people need to go in lose some money learn from it and then maybe make wiser investment decisions into the future yeah for sure i mean i think also with the um with the gamestop thing a lot of the tactics that were used are kind of similar to what hedge funds have done historically and there was a lot of freaking out as soon as the little guy did it and coordinated and you know i i realized that kind of shakes things up but at the same time you know i think as many people who are being informed in going into the market the better because especially with lockdown and stuff like if if you re getting stimulus checks that you want to put into something that you re speculating like i don t i don t know i don t see i don t see any issue with it as long as you re doing it responsibly and realizing that there is a risk and not just going off of reddit in time yeah and i would go even further and say you have a right to do it irresponsibly you know just don t come crying to anybody but yeah totally you know if you want to and this is the true of doge like there s some things that became jokes that people made a lot of money people lost a lot of money and in the end people need to assume that risk this is my action park libertarianism yeah well i gotta call my broker um so cardi b and sarah palin two rappers you may not have associated with each other and i wouldn t recommend watching the former alaska governor wrap baby got back on fox s show the match singer applause um so yeah we just watched um the former governor of alaska as well as the former vice presidential nominee from 2008 sarah palin rap baby got back had some bars there although polar opposites both of these public figures have been in the courts recently fighting libel laws this past week rapper cardi b was awarded four million dollars after suing popular youtube gossip blocker tasha k for defamation invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress tasha k admitted to spreading lies about uh cardi b saying things like she was a prostitute and used cocaine and had herpes some crazy stuff with beer bottles whereas cardi successfully won her suit palin has been fighting the new york times in court for four and a half years the media giant admitted one of its editorials and accurately linked the former vice presidential candidate to a 2011 shooting in tucson arizona which severely injured congresswoman gabby giffords as public figures palin will have to prove as cardi successfully did in her case that the times acted with genuine malice but will palin be able to prove it and are libel laws set out of the new york times versus sullivan too protective to the media uh this is a really crazy case because it s really hard to win a libel case and somehow uh cardi b did it yeah yeah i think like i think for people listening at home it s confusing because there are two different standards if you re a famous person or if you re a regular person it s very different if you re just a regular person you have to just show that somebody was negligent like meaning like like they didn t whether they intended to or not if they said something false about you that they could have reasonably avoided saying um with some effort uh then they could be held liable that whereas if you re a famous person there s a standard from new york times sullivan that says you have to show actual malice and the test there is essentially um was there some kind of intent uh or like serious subjective doubt uh about the facts that you had but you still moved ahead anyway and that s why the new york times finds itself where it is because if in this case of sarah palin these cases almost never make it to court and even though a lot of legal experts think she s gonna fail uh ultimately in the in the verdict um the reason why the new york times is even here in the first place is because there s a record of a new york times reporter uh drafting a story there was this map at issue with gun sights over it that palin put out and arizona was one of the states and and eventually gabby giffords got shot and there was this question of like did palin incite that or not but uh the original draft of this article there was no uh you know evidence of a direct link between that map and uh giffords getting shot uh and also uh there were just miscalculations of the way that the map looked and all that and then the editor came in and basically edited it to say the exact opposite and that is the paper trail that i think gets us to where we are today so whether or not the new york times loses they don t look great because it seems like they really really wanted to believe this about palin and printed it behind the scenes i think in a lot of newsrooms editors always want to ham it up and make it more sensational and this is a really good example of how much that can go awry especially putting a politician on the line for a shooting that they had nothing to do with um so i do respect that palin was definitely defamed by this but i think cardi had it so lobbed up to her in court with um with the defendant going on the stand and admitting that she knew that they were false and making videos from a couple years ago saying like oh i know this isn t true but quote i want the money like that s that s pretty bad and i also don t want to know what happened with those beer bottles supposedly laughter they need to know that yeah but that s the key what you re saying is the key like these cases are so hard to win with a famous person that you have to basically show like they have to say it out loud because that s how hard these cases are and what is like parody plays a big part in this too because i know like with a lot of excuse me i know like with a lot of celebrities if you use like parody law you can just get away with saying anything like the national choir and things like that yeah and parody and opinion right so you could say i believe that uh sarah palin incited violence uh and you know as long as you couch in those terms you re pretty much protected but i think that when you state it as a fact that s where you get yourself into trouble and so you know a lot of people are pushing for reforms these laws but the us is actually unique in having laws like this and gorsuch and thomas there s a lot of movement from the right to actually water down some of these standards which is i think the other significance of the palin case is that she s already signaled that she would appeal if she made it if they ruled against her which they likely will and it s possible this could make its way back up to the supreme court where they reevaluate new york times versus sullivan i doubt they ll have the votes yet we don t know what coney barrett s going to say but it s hard to imagine that they have the rest of the court they can get to five on this yeah to change the standard uh but i think it will be significant if it gets up there because it might make it closer and closer to a change in this law i don t love the concept of weakening the the protections that people have with us i think that especially as someone who comes from a newsroom and all the all the people that are whistleblowers and you want to you want to publish something on on rumor and expressly say that like i think that there could be damage done to journalism and people coming forward and actually exposing something or or nerves that are coming out of the newsroom that don t need to be there whereas i think having the the ex when i mean i think it s totally appropriate that if a newsroom purposefully is saying something false that s that s a different thing from from reporting something and i think that there s there s definitely could be a chilling effect of rolling that back but at the same time even with the cardi b situation i think now like a lot of youtubers and bloggers are going to be more careful when they know that something s not true and that s not necessarily a bad thing either yeah so i think i think like promoting caution is great but stifling the conversation is where i think some of these laws could end up going if they end up being amended and so i hope that we are as conservative as possible and tweaking them yeah absolutely did cardi b really need four million extra dollars from a youtuber i m not really sure i mean i definitely think that the youtuber was very malicious in what she did and it was not right at all but it reminds me a little bit about what teeter peter thiel did when he backed hulk hogan right against i think it was gawker oh yeah yeah yeah he didn t need the money it was more about the statement it was the page to say you know he i think he wanted to create a chilling effect uh for anybody in the future who came after and there s a little bit of vengeance in it too yeah i think whether she needs that money or not i think this was this is a cold move yeah it s pretty cool she s used to that but um yeah so we re talking about carter let s talk about music a little bit more here a trend in the music industry old music is out streaming new music like never before according to an article in the atlantic old songs now represent 70 of the us music market even worse the new music market is actually shrinking the 200 most popular new tracks now regularly account for less than five percent of total streams that rate was twice as high just three years ago so um this is really interesting now it is important to make the distinction that when this article talks about new music they re talking about music that s released in the last 18 months so literally anything outside of that window is considered old so this could be people just listening to songs for like three years ago four years ago but a lot of data suggests that a lot of young people and these people in general are listening to music you know from decades ago so what do we think about this trend well i m going to be the old man here and say that music today sucks uh that s that s what s driving that yeah i have no idea who s popular right now i don t know what s happening and i m just supposed to be a youngin i m not sure either olivia rodrigo yeah that s all i know um but but yeah so i i wanted to bring this up because i wanted to ask this question because i wanted to apply this to us is or do we fit this characteristic what was the last three songs you listened to for me oh you know this is embarrassing uh i i just went down a mariah carey thing as well i did not expect that yeah i was just i went back to her i don t know where she came up but i was just went through her back catalog uh i think it was like because of all the weird research i do for this show i have like a my youtube algorithm is also sounds like an excuse to me yeah it dished up a mariah carey tour of her house uh and so i was like oh mariah carey i haven t thought about her in a while and so then i went down the the rabbit hole of mariah carey so we re talking like earlier the odp i think it was the od i started with the odb i think it was fantasy yeah fantasy because i m from staten island so i like that but it s like and then it s kind of a gateway drug so i do the odb one i think there s one with jay z and then i m and then i m like full on in like ballad mode at a certain point like hero and all these other songs so yeah that s my yeah oh i fit this trend though that was like that was that s that s from the 90s that s from this older music what about you ricky i think i ve hit the trend as well but like in a more modern old music sense i ve i think during the pandemic for me especially with everything being kind of so out of control i ve enjoyed listening to music from my childhood like i don t know if it s a nostalgia thing for other people but i think there s something kind of comforting about it so i ve got some like early 2000s pops that i m embarrassingly still listening oh um last three songs i listened to was probably my life from billy joel and then i listened to this charming man by the smiths and then i listened to throw some d s by rich boy featuring polo to don so that was the last reason you know it s funny when i was over the winter break i i redownloaded billy joel s greatest hits oh yeah absolutely incredible no one s really making music like that anymore maybe that s what s driving this like there s just like maybe maybe music does kind of kind of suck these days yeah except for nostalgia some good old nostalgia i think did you just say country is really good right now yeah like who are you listening to in the country world i mean zach brown you know i saw their concert over the summer they had a new album that came out was pretty good uh i think that country to me it has like over the past like 10 to 20 years has like gotten better whereas almost every other kind of music has gotten worse really so you think about like jason isabel zack brown band um you know kenny chesney even like there s uh like i think like country is is getting less twangy and poppy and more sort of folky um so if you don t like country maybe it s time to get into it that s just nashville self coming out yeah i used to before i moved to nashville i used to say i like all music except for country music and then when i left nashville country s up there for me it s right there wow that s awesome well

seeing around the country is already the groundwork being laid to essentially have a coup so a redistricting frenzy is underway across the country it is map makers and politicians picking their voters rather than the other way around fewer people are aligning with the gop s platform and so in order for them to hold on to power they re going to cheat it wouldn t have to be a violent cool it would be a coup by legislative process music over the past 10 years texas gained about 4 million people in total population 95 of that population was people of color despite people of color fueling the growth over the past decade there were no new majority minority districts drawn in either the state senate the state house or the congressional map and in fact both committees made an effort to reduce the number of majority minority districts on all three levels there was a particular attention to a district just north of austin in a county called bell county that is home to a sizable black population and in this county we had two districts placed within its boundaries that looked like a donut there was the outer ring district and then there was the inner district that basically worked to cut up the population of the two biggest cities within that county basically ensuring that people of color in that county could not elect candidates of their choice some of the worst districts were in the greater houston area and into the houston suburbs and fort bend county in particular congressional district 7 take part of populations in harris county and then also cut up the aapi communities that have grown tremendously there over the past 10 years because of these maps that don t accurately reflect texans and their values we get a legislature that is passing laws that are not favorable with the people of texas and this includes senate bill 8 known as the texas heartbeat law bans almost all abortions in the state the texas bill is unique permitting almost anyone to sue any person or provider who may have helped someone get an abortion after the limit north carolina is really a true 50 50 state roy cooper who s our democratic governor won reelection by 51 the same election where trump won the state really all the statewide elections you see are right down the line we would hopefully expect that our state you know politics that our congressional members would reflect that but but they don t because of because of gerrymandering in the maps that just got passed the communities that are being targeted to dilute their representation are all urban communities they re all the places where communities of color are you know they re taking places like greensboro it s a growing town it s our third largest city has a very large historical black population that city is basically being scooped out of its county and paired with really rural mountain counties that are very far away have very different interests and are demographically very different even if democrats are winning more than 50 percent of the votes they re still ending up in the minority in our state legislature and our state legislature is deciding all these really impactful things i mean we re still one of the few states that hasn t expanded medicaid it s something that the vast majority of north carolinians want it would give health coverage to 500 600 000 people in our state who really really need it there s this just huge mismatch between what the people of the state actually want what they ve actually voted for and what they get georgia has 14 congressional districts and under the map that was passed republicans have between nine and ten of those seats which is really remarkable in a state that is one of the quintessential battlegrounds right now georgia is very much a 50 50 state almost evenly down the line what we saw last decade is the emergence of an increasingly diverse multi racial georgia tech gwinnett county for example which is in the suburbs of atlanta you know in 1990 gwinnett county was 90 white it s only 30 white today and yet that is not at all being recognized in the maps that the georgia legislature passed in the atlanta suburbs michelle al is the first chinese american woman elected to the georgia state senate her district is about 62 percent non white and in redistricting it s transformed to a district that s 52 percent white it goes from being a biden district to a trump district in ohio on the congressional map there are 15 congressional districts republicans are favored to win 12 of those in any given year democrats only three which is wildly skewed in fact you know that s about 80 percent of seats in a state where republicans at most win about 53 percent of the vote music we have reintroduced hr4 the john robert lewis voting rights advancement act hr4 will create a new coverage formula to determine which states have been the most egregious actors and subject them to pre clearance that is based on a current evidence of voter discrimination the freedom to vote act will improve access to the ballot by setting national standards for absentee voting early voting and in person voting this bill will end partisan gerrymandering

level in 40 years the u s consumer price index shot up by 7 5 percent last month outrunning wage growth and squeezing budgets all over the country now there are a lot of reasons for that but to hear from some progressive senators like bernie sanders and elizabeth warren there s only one culprit here corporate greed let s unpack what s really going on with the inflation crisis uh robbie there is this narrative that we re seeing on the left that is the corporations rising prices not actual inflation like what you know what s going on here yeah i think like one critical moment in this this narrative about inflation was joe biden before the super bowl did this interview with lester holt and it was incomprehensible uh he you know lester old asks about inflation uh and and i think biden says something like what are you trying to be a wise guy or something like that back in july you said inflation was going to be temporary i think a lot of americans are wondering what your definition of temporary is well you re being a wise guy with me a little bit i understand that s your job and then he goes into an explanation where he s saying well this is what like the nobel laureates and ceos are telling me and all that when can americans expect some relief from this soaring inflation according to nobel laureates 14 of them that contacted me and a number of corporate leaders it s ought to be able to start to taper off as we go through this year and so i think in a way you ve got this vacuum on the left where the president isn t really inserting himself with any clarity and because of that i think the warrens of the world the bernie s the world are stepping in and saying all right um you know there are hammers and and you know everything is a nail in the sense that everything is corporate greed for them and so they re telling their story and their story is resonating because you don t have a president who s telling a competing story and my sense is that uh what they re saying bernie and warren it s possible that corporate greed is a part of inflation and we ll go through the data it certainly does not seem true to me that it is the main driver of inflation right now and we ll go through some of those numbers i m sure but that s that s where i come out on this definitely and i think if you look at the amount of money that we ve been printing over the past couple years in response to covet which of course did start with trump but has continued with buy it in we ve increased the supply of dollars by 40 and so i mean just on a logical basis it s at the same time we have the supply chain issues so we have less goods and more dollars chasing fewer goods like it s inevitable that prices are going to rise and continue to rise but it s interesting like there s been kind of a flip in the narrative originally like in the summer there was a new york times article saying like what was it 179 reasons you shouldn t worry about uh inflation and there were tweets going going around like sarah jong who was formerly at the new york times at bison verge um she said all the stuff you re seeing about inflation in the news is driven by rich people flipping their which is just pretty much the opposite of what s going on right now i mean the more wealthy people tend to have more money in the stock market their assets kind of fluctuate with the value of the dollar versus people who are actually spending their paychecks at the grocery store the ones that are feeling this crunch and it s now the number one issue that people are concerned about at like 27 of people saying it s the number one problem yes there was a poll that ricky s referring to in which uh people were asked what s the what s the main problem facing this nation right now and most of them did say inflation 27 of them said and it was the number one issue there um but the value of the dollar has gone down and there was mass spending during the pandemic and also during the pandemic people bought more stuff like they were sitting at home they were panic buying they were hoarding stuff they were buying stuff off amazon because they were bored so you have lower supply because of the supply chain you know issues of the pandemic and you have higher demand because people are spending more money and they have more money to spend that just sounds like a disaster recipe for inflation yeah the timing was bad because in the beginning the pandemic was actually the opposite no spending so people had money they didn t have anything to spend it on because they couldn t really purchase uh the they couldn t purchase services because you couldn t go to a restaurant you couldn t go to that yoga studio etc they were you know for one of the rare times in american history we were saving more than we were spending and then the timing it all hit the market at the same time and so this is where i think like a lot of people are selling a simple story on this but inflation s driven by a lot of things you know rising demand which is what you just talked about you know we have all this money hitting the market at the same time uh spending rose 12 percent year over year in the week that ended february 5th you have falling supply which is obvious the supply chain issues the labor shortages etc you have increased production costs so material labor costs and then you have profits right and profits are part of that story but they re not the only part of the story and you can compare this pretty easily like to say like all right what is um how much do profits really play into this like robert reich the former labor secretary for clinton had this tweet about starbucks and calling out starbucks because they had record profits and you know i have a couple questions about his tweet number one is like it seems to me like almost every year we have record profits 2020 being an exception right so like it s not unique to me that you have record profits is it frustrating that you have record profits at a time when prices are going up yes but do i think that those record profits are a mere reflection of price gouging that s unique to this situation no like it s not like corporations just discovered greed yesterday yeah i would also have a question which is like people who are listening at home and i don t know what the answer to this is but if you have a local coffee shop down the street from you and you have a starbucks uh i would go and try to figure out like have the prices at your local coffee shop risen uh less high than uh or in less proportion to the starbucks uh first of all that s a supply that s a competition thing most places that have a starbucks probably have other coffee shops so if it s true that starbucks is raising their prices out of whack with the local coffee shop go to the local coffee shop but also if the local coffee shop is raising their prices at the same proportion that starbucks is maybe something other than price gouging is going on unless that local coffee shop is also being excessively greedy so i don t know like i just don t have an answer yet to it i want to be this populist who s like yeah it s the corporations and that s probably good politics so i understand the politics of it yeah but i m just not sure it s what s driving this well raising prices just across the board isn t the smartest thing for most corporations to do because they have competition and that s kind of you know your competition if your competition is lower prices they re going to get uh you know they re going to get the the dollar they re going to get the consumer s dollar well can i say one thing on that before we go to the next thing on the competition front one thing the byte administration did that i do agree with is when asked about this question uh at least in when they re earlier asked about this i don t know what they re saying this week on this but they did focus on the meat industry and that is an industry that to me seems like it does have problems with competition there are four companies that control 85 of meat processing in this country and that s double uh the amount of market consolidation than 20 years ago and so that s serious and to me and and that s an industry that is as unaccountable and uh i think uh lowercase c at least corrupt than anything like trying to get into meat processing trying to get into a meat processing plant in the united states is like harder than getting into fort knox i mean you saw what the beef industry did to oprah i think we need to be uh what d they do to her uh well remember when the whole mad cow disease thing happened and she had a whole expose about on her show the beef industry like threatened her and i tried to come after her so so if the beef industry is listening to this you know i do not endorse what robbie is saying about you i m just kidding i actually want to go back to one of these tweets about these rising prices this there s a tweet from kassam rasheed esquire that talks about all these different chipotle 26 profit increase raising prices starbucks 31 profit increase raising prices mcdonald s 59 profit increase raising prices it s and at the end of this tweet basically says there s not a labor shortage this isn t inflation it s 100 corporate greed what do you say to the liberal person the progressive person who is seeing these ceos are getting paid more money these profit margins are sky high and yet everything is getting more expensive to them it does seem like that s a big part of why things are so so expensive so how do you how do you explain to them that inflation is also a part of the equation without with this evidence sitting there well what i m curious about is this says the profit increase but not the percentage of the raising prices and so when you re holding the figure in your head of oh there s been a seven percent rate of inflation if these prices are being raised beyond seven percent then that s definitely some price gouging going on but you know these these are industries where when everyone s kind of locked down and we haven t been traveling as much and we have more expendable income like people might be more likely to go pick up their lunch at chipotle or grab us coffee at starbucks rather than make something in their keurig like it s i think that there s a potential that there s just more at play based on what how people s consumption is changing so i d be curious to see i i don t know off the top of my head what the rate is that they ve actually raised the prices themselves because if that s out of whack with inflation then that s definitely like some price gouging but i i would be very cautious to say that the fact that our money supply went up by 40 isn t part of what s going on here yeah and you could see that if you compare our experience with europe for example where they have very similar global supply issues that we have and an even worse experience with the oil market because of their their dependence on imports like we have we have way less dependent on imports because we have more domestic supply uh their inflation is less than ours what s the biggest difference well they printed less money than we did to ricky s point um i have another question about this and i i don t like big oils this is weird i m like almost defending big oil but you know john stossel uh you know he pointed out like when you know they talk about in this tweet 60 uh profit increase for big oil and he was like well when oil you know was it was dropping like the price per barrel of oil over the past few years especially at the heart of the pandemic were people saying whoa like these are these are really idealistic generous oil companies now they re cutting their prices for the good like like greed was invented in 2021 of course that s really supply demand thing now i do think i want to be clear i do think it s important to monitor these companies and say um is are the ceos making too much money especially like a lot of cases where ceos are making money but the the bottom line of the company isn t improving so like maybe they re the company s becoming less profitable and the ceo is making more money et cetera but what s interesting is here is like um that s not necessarily the argument that i m seeing but also like there there is a shareholder effect in a lot of these companies a lot of these aren t like facebook style companies where where there s these preferred shares and you can t hold mark zuckerberg accountable a lot of these are companies where you have people like warren buffett and huge institutions pension funds who own huge parts of these shares and there is a certain disappointing effect where if you re if you re spending too much money on compensation at the top end year over year over year and not improving your business then there is a certain discipline of the market now that doesn t necessarily mean it it goes down to the customer and and that s why i think there needs to be certain reforms and i think warren i don t love all the reforms that she proposes but i do think that if there are sensible ways that aren t too bureaucratic to to incentivize companies to pay people for performance i m for that but i also think the market can instill a lot of that discipline too and it s interesting nick gillespie for a reason um did a video recently about how elizabeth warren and this kind of new uh rising group in the left that s saying that this is corporate greed sounds a whole lot like gerald ford of all people who did with inflation now was his uh policy back in the day where he put a lot of pressure on corporations to keep the costs down or keep prices down and like in incentivized consumers to never pay above what like the prior market price has been and like even the washington post has like a super long article on how that s completely disastrous and when you try to manipulate the markets in that way it backfires so it s an interesting historical parallel between the two of them yeah i m like i m hesitant to do too many price controls there s like a horrible history of them outside of things that are like life saving medicines and things like that like they re there i think the government has an obligation if they re and then if they re going to do price controls they need to mean they have to ensure that there s adequate supply so a good example is like insulin is too expensive and i think that we should be lowering the cost of insulin but we also should make sure that the government takes on the responsibility of monitoring us to make sure that the supply is there uh and i think that s totally something the government can do but that this gets to my theory of government don t do that to too many different things because i don t think the government has the ability to maintain adequate supply of too many things in the market the market s volatile cryptocurrency is volatile um savings don t pay like so like if you re a conservative like hey i ve been put you know putting money away for a rainy day like you re losing money every day that you keep your money in a savings account and so and the houses are so expensive it s like where do you put your money right now like under your mattress music applause music you,"stock,big
