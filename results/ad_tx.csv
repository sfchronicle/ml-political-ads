142,my opponent is telling people that during our debate on april 18th i came out against the passage of proposition 1 something i never said the quote he uses refers to the part of the debate where i was asked about proposition 1 to which i responded it is not true property tax relief a statement i stand by even my opponent referred to proposition 1 as clean up language if propositions 1 and 2 pass more than 5 million homeowners would benefit from average savings of 176 excluding other higher local property taxes so no relief for small business owners that are the backbone of our economy landlords apartment owners renters and those with secondary properties it is time for real property tax relief with my plan your property taxes will decrease every year and will put us on a path to eliminating property taxes altogether while my opponent claims he supports property tax relief and has never raised taxes the facts are clear and his record says something completely different my opponent would rather lie about my intentions than talk about his record the fact is that when he was mayor he voted to raise property taxes every year in office and the people of new braunfels continued to suffer because of the increase in their property taxes in a recent article the texan points out during casteel s time as mayor new braunfels lowered its tax rate at various points something he touts often on the campaign trail including at the debate but reducing the tax rate does not necessarily mean property tax collections were reduced with rising appraisals unless the no new revenue rate at most is adopted property tax bills will increase not once during his tenure did the city adopt the no new revenue rate that would have kept tax bills unchanged from the previous year now new information has come to light that shows my opponent joined with other liberal democrat mayors and rallied against property tax relief legislation considered in 2017 this legislation gave voters a voice but my opponent thinks he knows what s best for you he wants to be able to raise your taxes without you having a say if he wouldn t support or implement property tax relief when he was mayor why should we expect him to do it in austin i have a plan to eliminate our property taxes while fully funding schools and without raising any other taxes you can read more about it at my website property ownership is a right and i will fight for that right,Carrie Isaac for Texas,facebook,"landlords,tax,tax rate,economy,taxes,small business,savings","economic,social and cultural",

168,now is the time to stop george p bush we now finally have the opportunity to put the end to the reign of george p bush if we do not bush could very well end up as governor of texas or god forbid the president of the united states that would be an absolute disaster now is the time that george p bush must be stopped i m sure that you are aware of bush s past actions not only with regard to the alamo fiascos but his mishandling of all the other functions of the texas general land office i need not rehash all of that here suffice it to say that he has failed every single duty he has as commissioner of the land office ken paxton has consistently been a strong conservative attorney general unlike bush paxton has performed the duties of his office well even exemplary win after win after win for texas over sanctuary cities the federal government etc as far as paxton s legal problems go i find it hard to believe that if they really had a case against him they would have waited for over seven years now to bring him to trial furthermore anything that paxton may or may not have done pales in comparison to the malfeasance of george p bush in the campaign for the run off bush is going to viciously attack paxton portraying himself as mr integrity nothing could be further from the truth george p bush and the texas general land office has received well in excess of one hundred million dollars for the alamo plan from the texas legislature bush hid all of that money under various 501 c 3 entities and has consistently refused to disclose where all of it went he has played an intricate shell game when called on the carpet by the texas land and resource management committee in march of 2019 to explain the money bush simply refused to show up twice when a state audit was finally ordered by lt governor dan patrick it showed that of the over one hundred million dollars 75 million dollars of that money is gone all we do know is that 16 million went to buy the three buildings across the street from the alamo the remainder went to parties unknown and undisclosed we are forced to conclude that much or most of that money went into the pockets of bush cronies associates and hired consultants and that s some 60 million dollars of taxpayer money missing this is one of if not the largest scandals in the history of texas but so far no one has held him to account we now have the opportunity to do that anyone can vote in the republican run off whether or not they voted in the march 1 republican primary the only people who cannot vote in the run off are those who voted in the democratic primary this year so even if you missed the primary please make certain you vote in this run off many texas voters are unaware that they can vote in the republican run off we must tell them we can defeat bush but only if we get all of our people out to vote do not be complacent assuming that paxton will be the winner merely because he got the largest vote in the march primary bush will be spending millions of dollars to viciously smear paxton all over the state we must work hard to counteract that the number of texans who are aware of bush s despicable actions regarding the alamo is miniscule and here in texas there are still multiple hundreds of thousands of voters who go in and mindlessly vote for the bush name in total ignorance of the facts george p bush could absolutely win this examples are numerous where a sitting incumbent got defeated in a run off by the second place finisher in the primary we simply cannot allow that to happen moreover do not relax your efforts because some recent polls show paxton with a substantial lead over bush these polls are merely snapshots in time of what the people are saying who are actually being interviewed they also do not reflect the impact of the overwhelming media barrage that is yet to be unleashed against paxton by bush the real result depends entirely on who actually shows up to vote in the election we must not forget that fact we must leave nothing to chance we must make the supreme effort right up to election day i am asking that each and every one of you make it a personal crusade to defeat george p bush i am asking that you send this message to every person in texas that you know and ask them to all spread the word also please hit the share button this time all of you then call and or email everybody that you can and ask them to do the same thing the margin of victory in this race could be razor thin that s why it is imperative that we get as many people as possible out to vote the run off will be on tuesday march 24 the early voting starts on monday may 16 and runs for only five days ending on friday of that same week it takes time for this message to spread so please begin your efforts right now we have a little over 2 weeks to get the word out to all of our voters if we all do this bush can be stopped once and for all thank you very much for your continued action remember the alamo rick range president save the alamo committee p s this will most likely be our last chance to stop george p bush in his planned upward climb please give this your very best effort if we do not get everyone possible out to vote in the multiple thousands bush could very well slip by and defeat paxton this is a very real danger to prevent that we must turn out an army remember that in the march primary over one half of the total vote was cast during the early voting period we therefore must get the word out on bush s true record immediately the vast majority of texans still to this day are totally unaware of bush s actions against the alamo we must tell them we cannot afford to lose the early vote so please start work on this right now if we can stop bush

226,it is with great appreciation and humility that i share this endorsement this man had a distinguished career in galveston county law enforcement and he served the citizens of league city with distinction written by retired league city police department detective cory beyer my name is cory beyer i am a retired police officer who dutifully served galveston county and league city for 23 years i began my law enforcement career as a corrections deputy in the galveston county jail in 1999 i worked nights in the jail for almost three years i later transferred to the gcso patrol division where i worked in bolivar and then in dickinson for about five years in 2006 i moved to the league city police department where i worked in the criminal investigations division for 15 years as an analyst and an investigator prior to being in law enforcement i was an airborne infantryman in the 82nd airborne division for four years and in the texas national guard for two years i have spent much of my life dedicating myself to the citizens of galveston county i am offering to you my full and heartfelt endorsement of darrell kelemen for galveston county sheriff i ve often joked that darrell is the most influential law enforcement official the public has never heard about i can make this joke because darrell was my supervisor for many years we worked on many projects in that time for instance many of you may not be familiar with the gulf regional information and dispatch grid consortium there are about 60 law enforcement ems and fire agencies using grid resources which is an amazingly complex network of hardware and public safety professionals the grid consortium is the central nervous system for all the public safety agencies confined to an area about 1 3rd the size of connecticut grid ranges from sugar land the port of houston utmb galveston almost all the galveston county agencies all the agencies around clear lake and many more the group is one of the largest consortiums seen anywhere in the united states darrell has been the single most important person responsible for the grid s ever growing size and consistently high performance grid has been one of the most transformative endeavors for public safety in galveston county and the surrounding areas since it began almost 15 years ago darrell has all of the front line officer experiences you d hope for in a leader he also has all of the experiences of a well rounded executive you d hope for in a leader he s gained these experiences by managing every one of the major components in a modern police department from the patrol division to dispatch jail and the records and support division there likely isn t a public safety problem darrell hasn t encountered and experienced from the perspective of each one of these important public safety components darrell is an expert in all things related to law enforcement management and operations i do not make this statement lightly his experiences as a leader have been magnified by his management of the grid which has put him at the forefront of all modern policing problems his telephone provides a constant stream of calls from the most highly regarded public safety leaders in galveston county the greater houston area and from around the country i ve travelled with darrell across texas to teach public safety classes to executives i ve witnessed police chiefs from around the county call darrell for advice i ve seen darrell barter with vendors to get the best possible pricing on multi million dollar technological purchases i ve worked with darrell as he brought police operations in line with superior service delivery models and law enforcement best practices his attention to detail would make a bomb technician jealous i know darrell believes in public transparency and he holds the ideals of democracy and due process as the ultimate objective and goal trying to summarize all of what i know and experienced with darrell into words is incredibly difficult none of what i m saying fits on a bumper sticker very well and that s because running a professional and modern law enforcement agency doesn t condense easily so don t take my word for it i d ask you to speak with all the chiefs of police in the grid consortium ask them this one question which candidate for galveston county sheriff has been to your agency more times to assist with organizational structuring problem solving through evidence based policing the improvement of service delivery models or the purchasing of transformative technology there s only one answer darrell kelemen,Kelemen For Sheriff Campaign,facebook,"law,due process,police,public safety,criminal,police department,police officer","governance,safety",

celebrate texas independence day jerry patterson opinion contributor by joint resolution in 1871 the 14th texas legislature established march 2 as an official texas holiday to commemorate the adoption at washington on the brazos of the texas declaration of independence since then many millions of texas schoolchildren have been taught that march 2 1836 is no less significant than july 4 1776 the day is often celebrated with parades ceremonies and children s choirs singing texas our texas all hail the mighty state remembering the words of bob wills and tommy duncan s western swing classic song time changes everything it now appears there s an ever growing list of woke texans who claim it is time to change how texans view the events of 1836 in their mind it was all about slavery and oppression houston chronicle reporter and author chris tomlinson wrote the texas revolt and it s signature battle were as much about slavery as they were about defending liberty and a new generation of texans who are majority hispanic are tired of listening to lies created to justify making texas an empire to slavery the san antonio city councilman in charge of the current alamo restoration project roberto trevino has described the alamo story as wrong and bunk and says it perpetuates a lie university of texas history professor jorge cañizares esguerra recently made the ludicrous claim that santa anna immediately after brutally suppressing another rebellion in zacatecas killing 2 000 non combatants marched his army into texas in february 1836 not for the purpose of suppressing another rebellion but rather to liberate slaves on east texas plantations i guess we are to believe santa anna got lost and ended up in san antonio de bexar instead cañizares esguerra also described the alamo as the largest statue to the confederacy in this country notwithstanding the fact the alamo battle predates the confederacy by 25 years if the texas revolution was about slavery how does one explain the non slave holding mexican states of zacatecas yucatan tabasco nuevo leon and tamaulipas being in rebellion at the same time texas fought for and existed as an independent nation their reasons for rebellion were the same as texas and slavery wasn t among them while the grievances were shared the outcomes were not in this rebellion against tyranny by a half a dozen mexican states only texas achieved independence the spark that started hostilities was not slavery instead it was santa anna s enactment of siete leyes seven laws in october 1835 which repealed the constitution of 1824 made santa anna dictator abolished all state legislatures and made the states departments with appointed not elected governors in response on nov 3 59 delegates from across texas meeting in what

listed the document was not without specificity and listed four general and 14 detailed causes for seeking independence slavery was not one of those reasons nor was it even mentioned if slavery were a cause of rebellion it could not have ranked any higher than no 19 the claim that the march 2 declaration of independence initiated a war of anglos against mexicans is also meritless the vice president of the new republic was lorenzo de zavala at least nine tejanos died at the alamo juan seguin s cavalry detachment at san jacinto consisted of up to 25 tejano cavalrymen while these numbers may seem small in 1836 anglos vastly outnumbered tejanos in the population of texas i do not subscribe to the premise that all texas history is glorious and inspiring there are shameful chapters and there are myths we must tell the whole story of texas warts and all i sponsored legislation to place a juneteenth monument at the texas capitol and i sponsored a commemorative license plate to raise funds for the buffalo soldier museum in houston i was deeply involved in producing the recent pbs documentary porvenir texas revealing a little known massacre of innocent tejanos by texas rangers in 1918 however where those i mentioned above as examples of this movement to disparage texas history have the high ground is their belief that we haven t been completely honest in telling the texas story they re right we have not for too long we have ignored or hidden the dark chapters of texas history and we have failed to recognize the contributions of other ethnicities that didn t conveniently fit our comfortable narrative today we can be honest about our history the good the bad and the ugly we can also celebrate texas independence day those two endeavors are not mutually exclusive god bless

263,alamo disrespecting george p bush may kill family s political dynasty please see the excellent article by isabel vincent that just came out in the new york post on march 4 describing the potential downfall of george p bush the piece goes into quite a bit of detail about the impact that all of us have had in the fight to save the alamo you can press this link to see the original we have also posted the full article below alamo disrespecting george p bush may kill family s political dynasty by isabel vincent march 4 2022 7 40am new york post at first glance george prescott bush seems the ideal political candidate in a state where his family has been a powerful dynasty for decades the telegenic texas lawyer is a grandson of 41st us president george h w bush and the nephew of george w bush the 43rd he is the eldest son of two term florida gov jeb bush and the great grandson of us sen prescott bush of connecticut the war veteran and father of two married to blond lawyer amanda williams bush is also mexican american on his mother s side and speaks fluent spanish but that might not be enough according to critics who accuse him of being the black sheep of the family and disrespecting the alamo texas most treasured symbol by bringing in modern minded out of staters for its restoration on tuesday bush 45 and incumbent ken paxton beat two other republican candidates vying to be the party s pick in the attorney general s race now a critical may runoff will determine whether the fourth generation scion will be able to shore up the family s political legacy in the lone star state analysts say but that s another problem the bush name is not popular in texas anymore luke twombly a dallas based political consultant and former communications director of the texas republican party told the post paxton the texas attorney general since 2015 has been indicted on securities fraud charges and accused of bribery and misuse of office in a civil whistleblower lawsuit but still has the support of the state s conservatives he also has the endorsement of former president donald trump a situation bush hopes to reverse by invoking trump in his campaign ads which don t mention the titans in his own family under the leadership of president trump our country was strong and vibrant again says bush in a campaign video at another point in the ad he notes like president trump i will not sit idly by while our freedoms are under attack because texas must lead the way in fighting this radical agenda if bush is trying to capitalize on his devotion to trump his opponents hope to end the bush family s political dominance in texas which began after george h w moved with his wife barbara from connecticut to the lone star state in 1948 to work in the oil business if conservatives unite we can end the bush dynasty paxton told a lubbock radio station wednesday the bushes have had their chances it s time for the dynasty to end bush commissioner of the general land office in texas has faced withering criticism from both democrats and fellow republicans for his work restoring the alamo historic site he s also been under scrutiny for his agency s administration of veterans homes where the covid fatality rate was 25 percent at seven out of nine facilities more than double the rate at the state s other nursing homes during the height of the pandemic in his eagerness to seek endorsements from trump bush has broken with members of his own family becoming the black sheep of a clan that has little patience for trump s hold on the republican party i can t imagine that george p is getting a lot of love from his family in pursuit of the trump endorsement said twombly although he likely needs trump s endorsement to win the race others say bush lacks the same leadership genes that propelled his relatives to political victory well maybe he s not exactly a black sheep but bush is not the guy jerry patterson bush s predecessor on the general land office told the post i knew 41 and 43 and bush is not a guy who is a leader he s a decent enough fellow but if you want someone to make hard decisions he s out of it he avoids controversy puts his head down as commissioner of the glo he has played fast and loose with the alamo the state s most sacred historic site he added patterson was so incensed with what he called bush s lack of transparency and bungling of the monument s restoration that he decided to run against him to get his old job back in 2018 when patterson lost to bush in the republican primary for the commissioner s job he decided to back bush s democratic opponent miguel suazo in the commissioner s race he wasn t the only one never in my memory have all primary opponents of a republican candidate either endorsed the primary winner s democratic opponent or stated publicly they wouldn t vote for the republican primary winner patterson said in addition to patterson losing republican primary opponents in the race rick range davey edward and david watts all refused to back bush there are things that are more important than your party said patterson who ran the glo between 2003 and 2015 the alamo is texas among the criticisms of bush s work on the restoration of the site which will include a new museum with a rooftop garden is a lack of transparency and the hiring of a philadelphia design firm that suggested incorporating modern glass walls calling in all these out of state so called experts who knew nothing about the alamo nothing about what it means to texas was bush s first mistake according to range a retired firefighter in an interview with the texas monthly he cannot be trusted with the future of the alamo range told the magazine he s flip flopped more times than a catfish stranded on the bank of a river despite the criticisms bush prominently features images of the alamo in his campaign ads which also include several references to trump s domestic policy greatest hits in his latest ad bush reminds viewers that he is a former navy officer deployed to afghanistan and promises to finish trump s wall he is filmed in dark glasses riding an all terrain vehicle in the shadow of the wall that marks the southern border with mexico it s such bulls t said patterson every damned politician talks about the wall but the attorney general has no impact on shutting down the border it s all bulls t it s almost what you have to do if you are a republican in texas still patterson like others is hesitant to write off bush just yet do i think he has a chance he said i think he has a chance bush s

264,phenomenal alamo diorama now on display in dallas please see this great article by michael granberry about the dallas alamo diorama for dallas hall of state remember the alamo means a sprawling 2 000 piece centennial exhibit pennsylvania artist thomas feely chose to debut the work in dallas and not at the alamo in san antonio by michael granberry dallas morning news 10 05 am on mar 24 2022 the battle of the alamo took place in 1836 and played a pivotal role in texas becoming its own nation before emerging as the 28th state in 1845 but 186 years after the battle with mexico the alamo remains a source of mystery and intrigue for millions not to mention controversy for one when most people think of the alamo they think of the mission façade which remains a major national landmark in san antonio the truth is the battle and the grounds of the alamo occupied a much larger land mass upon which more than 2 000 people fought and about 500 died according to stephen harrigan author of the widely celebrated book the gates of the alamo published in 2000 for those wanting to know more the dallas historical society will unveil on march 29 at the hall of state in fair park a major exhibition that documents the full scope of the 13 day battle it occupies a 14 by 24 foot canvas in the basement of the building featuring more than 2 000 handcrafted miniatures the name of this diorama is texas liberty forever the battle of the alamo says karl chiao executive director of the dallas historical society which has occupied the hall of state as a tenant since 1938 that was two years after fair park and the state fair of texas served as the central exposition site of the texas centennial celebration to which president franklin d roosevelt paid a visit the sweeping diorama which the hall of state hopes will lure thousands of visitors to fair park is the creation of an artist named thomas feely who chiao describes as a 75 year old who lives in the woods in rural pennsylvania feely has long been drawn to the history of the battle in which the army of mexican gen antonio lópez de santa anna reclaimed the alamo mission near san antonio de béxar now known as san antonio overcoming though not without difficulty the greatly outnumbered texians and tejanos inside fueled by revenge the texians vanquished the mexican army at the battle of san jacinto on april 21 1836 ending the rebellion in favor of what became the newly formed republic of texas nine years before statehood dallas v san antonio getting feely and his diorama to dallas during a pandemic no less carried its own aura of mystery and intrigue as does a question that more than a few may ask why is the piece being shown in dallas and not at the alamo in san antonio where the battle took place that too is a story as for the artist he has done so many jobs chiao says he has been a police officer he has been a bar owner he s kind of a jack of all trades but one thing he s always loved is making little figures or figurines he loves to create these little figurines feely began assembling the diorama in 2000 which means by the time it was trucked to the hall of state he had been working on it for more than two decades with the pandemic forcing the cancellation of the state fair of texas in 2020 chiao and exhibits manager toby hazelip took a road trip to transport feely s alamo from the backwoods of pennsylvania to fair park chiao s curiosity had been aroused in december 2018 when i got a call from a guy who said there s the potential of you having this amazing thing in dallas that man is rick range who lives in dallas and belongs to the alamo society i ve got a friend named tom feely range told chiao and he has built a diorama of the battle of the alamo range laid out the particulars it is 1 54th scale it is 14 feet by 24 feet it has more than 2 000 hand painted figures and then he said this was supposed to go the alamo but because of issues feely had with alamo management range told chiao he was thinking of throwing it away i told him you can t do that it s your life s work it might not go to san antonio but i know there s a place for it somewhere in texas which led to range recommending to feely that the next best destination would be the hall of state born in taiwan chiao moved to san antonio when he was 5 over the years he says he has grown weary of the folderol surrounding the alamo as the dallas morning news put it in a march 2020 editorial the battle of the alamo ended in march 1836 or so we thought but how did feely s diorama become entangled in the current day drama surrounding the alamo the alamo has been going in a different direction chiao says with a sigh let s just say it s becoming a little more pc politically correct in other words to focus on the battle itself is no longer as popular as it once was amid tussles over race and historical accuracy and the so called reimagining of the alamo and in addition to that politics has also reared its head with the latest flurry of what the news called political cannon blasts pitting one gop stalwart against another that would be texas land commissioner george p bush and lt gov dan patrick bush v patrick bush the son of former florida gov jeb bush and the nephew of former president george w bush oversees the general land office which manages the operations of the alamo george p bush will face a runoff on may 24 in an attempt to unseat incumbent state attorney general ken paxton bush has been the target of criticism by patrick and others over choices he s made regarding the alamo as a headline in the texas tribune proclaimed in december 2019 the latest battle of the alamo pits lt gov dan patrick against land commissioner george p bush with a subhead adding the feud began when bush was incorrectly accused of trying to erect a statue of mexican dictator santa anna at the alamo site in 21st century america the mere mention of the word alamo is guaranteed to entice discussion but as author harrigan once said the subject is buried in so many layers of myth and counter myth as to be nearly irretrievable david lozano the executive artistic director of dallas cara mía theatre co sees the story of the alamo as being far more complicated than popular history has portrayed it for one when the battle occurred texas known then as tejas was part of mexico for latinos it s a question of how we end up being portrayed in texas history in particular lozano says in other words can we not jump to the conclusion that the u s settlers in texas are automatically the heroes in the story and stop portraying the mexicans or the mexican government as the automatic villains or oppressors in the story to do so we run the risk of making one side s version the predominant narrative it s important for us to see all of the people in the story as human beings and certainly not as racialized heroes or villains chiao contends that feely s piece is in no way political nor is it intended to be rather it documents the battle only his showcase of visual art documents who fought at the alamo and what it looked like as though he were sent there as a photographer traveling back in time this much is indisputable yes there was a battle and like any battle it was bloody and awful in 1983 feely made a 4 foot by 6 foot diorama that for years occupied a niche at the alamo he had made it for the daughters of the republic of texas which once managed the alamo whose stewardship george p bush ended in favor of his own state agency after the daughters of the republic left the building chiao says so too did feely s smaller diorama feely had an issue with the state over how they wanted to portray it says chiao who cites the artist s failing health as why he won t be coming to dallas for the exhibition nor will the hall of state make him available for interviews feely did reluctantly fly to dallas in march 2019 to check out the hall of state and meet his potential hosts he did not want to stay in a hotel so the hall of state arranged for him to sleep in an rv parked outside harrigan whose book on the alamo has been widely hailed by all sides mentioned feely in the pages of texas monthly in 2000 and praised his work in particular his earlier smaller diorama shown at the alamo a spirited diorama of the final assault by thomas feely harrigan wrote should not be missed in 2003 texas monthly writer caroline harper added her praise one of the most dramatic exhibits in this building harper wrote is a large diorama depiction of the battle of the alamo constructed by thomas f feely jr the model is replete with exquisite detail including tiny mexican and texan soldiers trees guns cannons and even smoke made from cotton and of course that diorama was merely a sneak peek of what the hall of state will unveil officials at the alamo say they too are intrigued we are dedicated to telling the story of the battle of 1836 alamo spokesman jonathan huhn said in a statement shared with the dallas morning news the battle was a brutal conflict where hundreds of texans gave their lives for a single ideal liberty mr feely s diorama is a fantastic depiction of the battle we sincerely hope that once the museum and visitors center is completed that the alamo will have the room available to display such large works of historical art feely s inspiration artistic inspiration is of course paramount so where did feely s come from the reason he likes the alamo is he grew up watching davy crockett chiao says referring to the television series starring fess parker that aired on abc from 1954 to 1955 he loved it and then at some point he saw a magazine which had on its cover a diorama of the alamo and where was that diorama shown to the public at the hall of state in fair park during the 1936 texas centennial so he comes into our building in 2019 and he sees that diorama and he literally starts crying chiao says he says this is what inspired me to make mine and yes this would be a great home for mine the whole thing was amazing chiao says feely s elaborate undertaking became a multi year process of constant tinkering he remade it three times he had a group of eight to 10 guys that helped him research what the final product became they re all members of the alamo society they re die hards between the eight to 10 of these dudes i d say there are at least 70 to 80 years of research among them if they found out there was something that wasn t correct tom changed it immediately such as the height of a building or if the arms of the soldiers were at the wrong angles it s that kind of detail he wanted it to be perfect and by the end he felt that it was chiao says the finished product depicts about 1 500 mexican soldiers descending on the alamo with about 200 people on the texian side including men women and children the sprawling piece also shows horses and cattle and dogs and yes even a cat a cat the minuteness of detail also ended up in the faces he did try to put people s faces on them if he knew what they looked like and if he didn t he would put the faces of friends of his on the characters on one of the defenders he put john wayne s face on there wayne starred in the 1960 oscar winning movie the alamo in which he played col davy crockett wayne also directed the film another person has fess parker s face chiao says feely left all these little easter eggs you can find chiao expresses amazement over the complexity of detail and the deep artistic commitment feely made to finish the project amid a mountain of obstacles those assisting him knew what kind of cannon was on what kind of carriage was it a two wheel carriage was it on barrels they knew all the details about the uniforms they even had an inventory list from the mexican side they knew how many battalions there were how many sets of ladders each battalion had so there was a lot of research done on this piece and on its moment in time the ice storm against all odds the diorama escaped the siege of ice and water that ravaged the hall of state and other parts of fair park in february 2021 so now feely s piece will become a permanent free exhibit in the south texas room where chiao says it will symbolize an internal triumph the end to its own battle the hall of state had been fully renovated in late 2020 at a cost of 14 41 million but then came the record winter storm that killed 246 people and leveled a new round of damage to the 84 year old building leading to a second renovation which cost just over 3 million chiao says there is no better way to honor the historical society now celebrating its 100th centennial than for people by the thousands to come to the hall of state to see with their own eyes tom feely s masterpiece after all he says the battle of the alamo is the reason the alamo is historic and tom s exhibit is nothing less than a breathtaking illustration of it,Save The Alamo

268,a must read before voting on bond great research matt stringer with odessa headlines the numbers surrounding ector county isd s ecisd bond proposals totaling nearly 400 million doesn t seem to make sense to us from the perspective of matching the data to the rhetoric being used to sell the bond to voters let s take a look voters have recently been inundated with postcards signs and other messages promoting the proposed ecisd bond to build a new high school a career and technical school cte and to spend 130 000 000 on school maintenance items the overall gist of the messages is that our schools especially permian and odessa high schools are overcrowded to the point of breaking due to recent growth and that the regular ecisd budget provides inadequate resources to maintain existing facilities and must be supplemented by bond debt a review of the data provided by ecisd however seems to paint a different picture each year each school district is required to produce a report called the annual report of certain financial and local debt information this report is produced in june of each year with ecisd s report being dated june 30 2021 and it contains an overview of ecisd s finances the first interesting finding in the data shows that student population growth has been minimal if not stagnant over the past six to seven years allow us to explain student enrollment for the 2015 2016 school year was 31 791 students slowly increasing to its highest point during this timeline to a total of 33 822 students for the 2019 2020 school year total growth of 2 031 students at its highest ector county isd annual report of certain financial and local debt information fye june 30 2021 but then the numbers drop presumably due to the pandemic economy for the 2021 school year to 31 881 students thusly our change in student population over the past six seven years constituted an increase of 0 28 percent or 90 students furthermore odessa headlines previously reported that during the bond committee meetings a district commissioned study showed that future student population growth over the next five years was only estimated to be around 1 000 students that s fairly minimal change if you think of it as a 12 year period looking specifically at the enrollment at ohs and phs shows a similar trend where attendance at ohs decreased by 35 students from last year to this year and is only 64 students higher than in the 2018 19 school year enrollment at phs was up slightly 105 students from last year but was down 83 students from the 2018 19 school year the data and the rhetoric seem to tell different stories and it doesn t stop there budget data for ecisd reveals some striking statistics with funding during this same data time period showing a staggering 59 65 percent increase in funds per student the report page entitled total revenues all governmental funds by source shows that ecisd funding has grown from 264 523 102 in budget revenue in 2015 2016 to a whopping 422 327 741 or 13 247 per student in 2020 2021 including dramatic increases from all sources of revenue ector county isd annual report of certain financial and local debt information fye june 30 2021 part of this increased funding was fueled by the 2018 tax increase voters approved via the tax ratification election tre this voter approved measure provided approximately 18 million in additional funds in the first year and the district has enjoyed a tremendous increase in local property tax backed revenue every year since in the first year of the tre this money was spent to provide staff salary raises of 9 826 026 1 5 million to replace school buses 6 25 million to pay insurance deductibles to complete roof repairs and 500 000 to make security enhancements to various campuses after the first year many in the community understood that these annual taxpayer provided funds would continue to be used to maintain the staff wage increases purchase 10 15 new school busses each year so that the ecisd fleet stayed in good repair with the balance of roughly 10 million per year being used to provide a revolving fund to provide ongoing maintenance to ecisd campuses the current bond proposals list 130 million to be used for school maintenance needs and provide little information on where the approximately 10 million in available yearly tre funds have been funneled over the past five years ecisd presently enjoys a local property tax revenue that is roughly 30 million higher in the 2020 2021 budget than the 2017 2018 school budget not to mention the significant increases in state and federal funding ector county isd annual report of certain financial and local debt information fye june 30 2021 our conclusion quite simply put the rhetoric promoted by the pro bond forces doesn t seem to be supported by the data ecisd has enjoyed a tremendous increase in local state and federal tax dollars over the past 6 7 year budget period and outside the minimal student population fluctuation up to the year 2020 the district currently has nearly the same student population that they did years ago but also nearly 60 percent more funding student population growth has been fairly minimal and projected growth isn t very high either another factor to consider is that as private and charter schools continue to set up shop in the area that should translate into continued relief for the district s population numbers it is a fair question for residents to ask before heading to the polls to vote next week when exactly did this overpopulation crisis occur and

361,high density development how did we get here the development train is coming full speed and the cities in rockwall county have been hog tied to the tracks it seems a little melodramatic but this is the position we find ourselves in how exactly did we get here the connections and overlaps between city county and state power create a delicate ecosystem where balance is crucial to the stability of all cities have mechanisms in place to control development within their borders and the ability to annex lands not yet incorporated was an important tool to prevent huge developments with the ability to overwhelm current infrastructure roads schools and public safety from going up in the unincorporated land outside the cities control in 2019 the texas state legislature house bill 347 took away the cities ability to annex and that change has upset the balance in some very big ways every council member i know myself included along with every mayor from every city in rockwall county could see what such a change would mean and worked to try and stop it from happening these leaders engaged our state legislators and many mayors travelled to austin to testify i and others begged david sweet to join the fight to protect the balance that benefits us all he was uninterested now the cities must rely on the county to protect them from the kind of high density development along their edges that causes crime to skyrocket overcrowding in schools and traffic clogged streets but instead of protecting us david sweet continues to fail us instead of working to strengthen the county s existing subdivision regulations sweet waves from parade cars while overcrowding eats away at our quality of life instead of standing strong and enforcing the county s existing 1 house 1 5 acre septic standards sweet passes out plat approvals and lets developers build sewer plants when all he would have to do to object is respond to a simple email sweet stays silent and fails us again we are in a downward spiral and when the dust settles we will be over developed with an inadequate infrastructure and smelly sewer plants scattered throughout the county the time to fight is now and sweet is no fighter it is past time to put him out to pasture and bring in someone willing to do the work waving in parades is nice but it is no substitute for real leadership and real leadership is what rockwall county needs to stop the development train in its tracks,Kerri Kristin New,facebook,"borders,public safety","immigration,safety",
