       "0      Elon Musk's 44 billion dollar cash offer for Twitter is accepted, so a new day dawns for communication in the public square \"for the future of humanity.\" Now as one Republican officeholder that really started on Twitter after the former CEO Dorsey cut off ads for political accounts, I stayed on tweeting conservative public policy solutions to Texas' challenges! I wasn't going to give up on the public square discussion and slowly doubled my audience with good content @teambettencourt. So, I wish Elon Musk well in his already announced reforms. This Reuters article covers that and more, and It's well worth the read at:\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-twitter-set-accept-musks-best-final-offer-sources-2022-04-25/\\n\\nThe best public policy stands out in any public debate, and Musk is smart enough to realize that standing up for free speech pays tremendous dividends to all those that participate. That's why he's not worried about the economics of his purchase publicly because if he does his job, he will exceed expectations again like he did at PayPal, Tesla, and SpaceX!!   \n",
